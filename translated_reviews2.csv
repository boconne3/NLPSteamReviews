"10/10, would Mod again! But in all seriousness, I've clocked in nearly over 300 hours on this game alone - more than any other in my steam library. Yeah, it's bugged up to the eyeballs, and the occasional CTD can get a little frustrating, but I personally blame it on my inability to load Mod orders correctly, lol. There are plenty of fixes out there; and considering the sheer mammoth size of the modding community, there are countless ways to renovate, enhance and completely alter the experience each play through. You get out what you put in with this one I'm afraid. I wouldn't recommend it for those who don't care much for modding, aren't too savvy with mods, or simply don't want to sink the time and effort into finding and installing them (correctly). The stability of the game may suffer for it (at times), but if you've set up your mods correctly the collateral damage is pretty unnoticeable, and will only rear its ugly head from time to time. Some mods even exist to minimize/fix certain problems that exist in the vanilla game, or as a by-product of other mods. Suffice it to say, if you're inclined to buy this game and you find yourself enjoying the experience, You'll be spoilt for choice, and replaying the game over and over again to sample all that the game, and the modding community, has to offer!

"In order not to be considered quite rich Buratina, for a start. Oculus Rift CV1 with two Touch controllers I took in the fall of 2018 for. He also had to take a third sensor for 3.5k on Avito, so that he would not lose me when I turn my back to the two front ones. The total is not that expensive compared to current prices for the Rift S () and the newfangled Valve Index (frenzied). I crank everything to the maximum and everything flies on Core i7 7700k, 16 Gb RAM and RTX 2070. Although the game swears in the menu for too high settings. Perhaps there was no point in twisting everything to max, since the resolution in the Rift CV1 is FullHD for each eye. In new helmets, the resolution is already higher, but I will not see these textures. It plays great with two Oculus Touch controllers. Unless, due to the location of my sensors, they did not see my hands quite close to the floor, which is needed a couple of times in the game when defusing mines. But this is solely due to the configuration of the furniture in my room. And so shooting, reloading weapons, soft pleasant vibration, everything is available. To move, of course, is better with the stick, I have long been accustomed to VR and I do not feel sick. If you've played VR games with hand controllers, there aren't many new things here. In the same Robo Recall, there were shotguns / rifles hanging from the back, then Alix takes out ammunition from his backpack. The game takes quite a long time, I went through the game for several evenings for three hours per call, the batteries in the controllers were already dead, I had to change. If you played Half-Life 2 voraciously while still on a pirate, where after each download you had to write ""ai_disable 0"" in the console so that NPCs would not be dummies, then you do not need to explain anything. As soon as you start to get a little bored in the second half of the game, Jeff appears. Cool guy, I advise everyone to meet. And just brilliant game design. The same map at the zoo is beautiful.

"is a mediocre puzzle, platformer and skill game that was particularly inspired by. Alan wakes up with a memory disorder in an underground research center. He has to pass 25 tests in order to demonstrate and improve his cognitive and physical capabilities. He is accompanied by his doctor in charge, Darwin, who always finds motivating and calming words. But Darwin is targeting another character trait of his patient and tries to determine this with the help of decision-making questions, but also secretly to shape it: Allan's morality. The game consists of three acts that build on each other: The first part functions as a tutorial. The clear components of the puzzles are explained to the player in ten test chambers. As with there are opaque and refractive cubes, lasers and light bridges. Up to the tenth level, the tests are extremely entertaining and make you want more. Unfortunately, the last chamber of the first section is unnecessarily frustrating as it is made up of different horizontal levels and a crash within target range results in an almost complete restart. The positions of the dice and activated switches are saved, but the parkour you have covered must be rerun. And that's exhausting. Very exhausting. Because a small misstep, a wrong jump or a reaction that is too slow inevitably leads to Alan's death. In a puzzle game, comprehension should be in the foreground and not skill or responsiveness, otherwise it would be a platformer. Unfortunately, the majority of the 15 main tests that follow builds on this type of level design. Only occasionally do you come across mental challenges, mostly it is timing and a high level of frustration that are addressed and put to the test. In addition, another functionality of the game will be introduced in the last two tests: weightlessness. Regrettably, the tests for the underlying solution are simple, but extremely nerve-wracking to perform. The shop page advertises through or inspired gameplay, but this statement does not apply to the main part of the game. The last chapter is similar to: Breaking Out of the Research Complex. The protagonist has to flee via the abandoned offices and common rooms of the employees and via hidden parts of the institution. This chapter has been implemented excellently and revised, at least for me, the numerous negative experiences from the main part. Between the tests, Darwin puts the player in a moral dilemma. There are only two possible answers, but both lead to the imaginary sacrifice or rescue of people or groups with different characteristics, which are partly obstructive and partly essential for the survival of humanity. These decisions do not influence the game, but are evaluated and compared globally at the end of the game. The high quality voiceover is in French and the subtitles are in English. Bugs almost never exist and irreversible actions are always excluded. In detail, however, it can often be very tricky when moving or placing cubes. The accuracy of the jump and Alan's indolence are also in need of improvement. The game is a bit expensive because after four to a maximum of five hours - with 100% unlocked achievements - the credits can be seen. Overall, I finished with mixed feelings. On the one hand the story was interesting and the first and last chapters were varied. On the other hand, the main part was made more difficult by skill tests and the playing time was artificially stretched. The fact that the game was developed by only one person and that his passion for puzzle games is clearly recognizable, finally moves me to a limited recommendation. Because if you are looking for profound puzzles and intellectual challenges or want to tackle puzzles in peace, you may be disappointed. ",True,False

"I recently finished this game, after playing the first one and the expansion packs. I already called Half-Life 1 one of the best games i've ever played, but this one is my all-time favourite. The game is not even nearly perfect, it is perfect. It's action packed, it got GREAT graphics, animations and more for a game from 2004 and it even got moments which were truly epic. Unlike the first one, this one offers more puzzles, greater and more evoirments and more action and even a little bit of horror in it. You not only fight against one enemy, no you get to fight headcrabs, helicopters, City 17 Guards, zombies and more. You kill them on your own creative way around the middle of the game when you get more weapons like the Gravity gun, one of my favourites. It let you travel to so many cool area's and not only on foot.. You get to travel to there with for example a car. Absolutly amazing. It's one of the few games of 2004 that offered so many beatiful content and realistic fighting. For example, around the end of the game, you get to control rebels against City 17, they help you, and give you health if needed. Sure, it got it's bugs, sometimes it also brought me motion sickness.. But that didin't stopped me from playing it. The ending and the mysterious G-Man makes me wanna' play Episode 1, which i surely will. It's only 9 bucks, so if you want to spent that money on a epic journey with enough replay valaue, then go ahead. Buy this game, a game which i think, never gets old and always will stay one of a kind. ",True,False

"A popular comic strip, followed by an equally popular television series, and finally, video games. And if Survival Instinct, to put it mildly, did not succeed, and the glorious No Man's Land for mobile phones is not so well known to the general public, then The Walking Dead: Season One adventure game has earned a good reputation among both Walking fans and ordinary players. Later it got a sequel called The Walking Dead: Season Two, and the third season is gaining momentum with might and main ... Wait, is this a game or another series? Let's start with the fact that ""play"" is a loose concept. And Telltale Games is quite rightly reproached for stretching it so that there is nowhere else. Natives of LucasArts ate a whole kennel in the production of quests, but in recent years they have made a noticeable bias towards ""interactive films"" based on famous works. They hit Back to the Future, Jurassic Park, Fables, Borderlands, Game of Thrones ... even Minecraft! This cup has not passed and ""The Walking Dead"", and this is not surprising. Where, if not in the atmosphere of a zombie apocalypse, can a truly strong dramatic story and vivid characters unfold? The comics and TV series have proven it quite well: time is behind video games. And Telltale kicks in - at least when it comes to the script. The rest of the game will be able to count only on the fingers ... And in the first ""season"" things are not so bad. We are even offered a kind of choice of difficulty - either with highlighting key areas for interaction, or without it, as well as without showing the reaction of other characters to the actions of the hero. They assure that the story will develop the way the player wants, and not someone else. Look, they say, we have a real game! It can even be replayed to make the story take a different course! The impression, however, spoils a little already in the first five minutes. The branded inscription ""'The name of the character' will remember this"" pops up in a dialogue with a policeman doomed to inglorious death and zombification already in the prologue. ""How will he remember this?"" - an inexperienced gamer racks his brains. Don't worry, this is Telltale, it’s the way it is. Better to shoot the poor fellow as soon as possible and enjoy the story. Already in the first episode of Season One, you can be sure that the developers are masters of storytelling and staging. Wonderful live dialogue with perfectly matched voice acting. The verified angles of the game camera, dynamics, even the QTE scene - everything is done at the highest level. Former history teacher Lee Everett, even though a convicted criminal, instantly disposes, and this impression only grows stronger as the game progresses. The authors immediately put on the main character a ""personal conscience"" - an eight-year-old girl Clementine, whose parents went on vacation from the suburbs of Atlanta to Savannah at the wrong time. Four hundred kilometers is not a problem when buses run, but the sudden zombie apocalypse ruined everything. Lee himself has no reason to stay in place, so why not help the little one left without parents? Traveling through the agony of the zombie virus in Georgia isn't going to be easy - and it won't be. In history, you can find fault with a number of points, but only if you really try. The main plus is that it is not boring at all and always keeps you on your toes. Even at the moment of rest, the player does not leave the feeling that soon everything will go to hell - and, of course, this is how it happens. Telltale Games is not bound hand and foot by budget constraints for actors and sets, so nothing stops them from maintaining the right pace. If in the TV series on The Walkers the second season the characters spend on the farm and the viewer dies of boredom, then the second chapter of Season One, in the same rural surroundings, is so terrifying that the hair stands on end all over the body. Developers and contracts with actors loved by the general public are not associated, so no one is insured against sudden death, regardless of gender and age. There are pluses and minuses in this - on the one hand, the required level of drama is maintained, on the other hand, such techniques become boring already at the end of the first game. Should you go through The Walking Dead: Season One and its sequel? Yes, if only in order to touch a peculiar phenomenon and personally appreciate the history. There is not much to play here, well, at least there is something to see. The main thing is not to relax with a bucket of popcorn, because the ""walker"" from the scenario bushes can jump out completely suddenly, forcing him to convulsively grab the mouse and poke the Q key. Tea is not some kind of serial! ",True,False

"Blasphemous is a pretty good 2D platformer that combines a small part of the game mechanics of old / modern games like Blades of Vengeance, Dark Souls, etc. The plot of the game tells the story of the brave warrior Penitent, who fell under the curse of an endless cycle of death and rebirth, called the people of the land of Kvstodia - the Miracle, now the main character has to break this vicious circle in this devout world saturated with a perverted religion and the atmosphere of Dante's Inferno. The gameplay of the game is simple, where you have to run through non-linear locations stuffed with secrets and hordes of different monsters, along the way find / collect bottles of bile (analogue of estus), various artifacts that give certain effects of protection against damage or resistance to different elements of magic, so you need to adapt to different type of enemies and locations, as they contain traps and dangerous obstacles. For killed enemies, ""tears of redemption"" will be credited, this is the local currency (analogue of souls) for pumping a sword and additional combos, buying expensive artifacts or keys from secret locations, also for ""tears"" you can restore a bar of zeal, it will also allow you to use various magic, well, do not forget about the altars (analogue of bonfires).

"I recommend the game rather than not. But there were many things I didn't like about her. The game has beautiful locations - a forest at the beginning of the game, chapters with railway tracks and a sawmill, but a lot of the game will have to run in complete darkness or in continuous fog. Pseudo-open locations in the forest are made looped, i.e. where you don't go, you still go out to the camp with a tent (and so on in 4 chapters), until you find the plot item and you can go further. The last 17th Chapter is very much drawn out in terms of duration. VERY long wanderings through the looped corridors in the witch's house. It was safe to cut it in 2 times. Monsters - 2 types, the first are killed by the light of a flashlight, the second are immortal, you need to bypass them and not look at them. Boring. To get all the achievements and endings, the game must be completed 2 times. One of the achievements - Pacifist (don't kill a single monster) is better to get in the second playthrough.

"is a production created in 2009 by the studio.

That's why I decided to download the save from the game's website. After opening it, I lost developer comments + unlocked all achievements. The Whispered World is a very hard game.

"One Shot Three Kill A continuation and at the same time the third installment of the action game struggling with the life of a sniper, re-released by the Polish developer CI Games, where production costs reached as much as PLN 40 million. The place of action was planted in Georgia in an open world, in the realities of a local conflict, the Kremlin has become the main terrorist object in which we eliminate dangerous enemies behind enemy lines. Our main character, which we control, is Jonathan North. In addition to the main mission, our hero has his own case to find his younger brother in Georgian territory, we support the local resistance movement in exchange for information about his brother's place. The open world in the game is large enough to overcome the roads, the creators offered us the opportunity to explore the areas thanks to the vehicle that we drive through most of the game in order to find outposts and other key places, in addition to fast traversing, fast travel anywhere on the map can help us thus we will find such a travel point. The story missions are quite longer than the predecessors, and we perform side missions in various combat possibilities and we make our own decisions from three paths as a long-range sniper, as a ghost during silent elimination thanks to suppressed weapons and be a fighter by carrying out frontal attacks from a heavy arsenal. In the game, a skill system has been added to the three paths that we will take, we will unlock helpful accessories for our sniper faster healing or more ammunition, but the creators at this point did not try too hard and went the easy way. The weapon we have at our disposal is huge, there is a camera with a bullet as well as modifications in the workshop, adding silencers, creating cartridges, larger magazines, we unlock various sniper rifles with considerable recoil power, assault rifles that help in close combat with a large group of enemies and a reflex bow that we will get in one hidden cave, I recommend a shotgun for close range. We have everything available in one hideout from three individual maps, here we prepare everything before the mission, what we take with us and get to know the mission plan, in addition, we get orders to eliminate the most dangerous criminals sought, for which we get interesting money loot. For extreme navigation conditions, we have been equipped with a sense of a scout on the basis of a detective mode, finding traces and a drone that helps us find enemies by tracking them and showing the right path, in addition, in Georgia, a few challenges with a drone are not enough, but a nice toy for finding interesting discoveries . The graphics work on a modified CryEngine graphics engine, using the potential of our computer configuration, we will be satisfied with the maximum graphics settings from the beautiful mountains in Georgia with a daily cycle and the sunset weather, in technical matters the game can sometimes throw us to the desktop, but the optimization has been very well improved .

"In the near future, integrated by AI, people will see the world through augmented reality. Nathan, who lives in the trafficking of illegal hardware, finds his lover, artist Jay, disappearing when he wakes up in the morning. What was waiting for Nathan to go out into the neon glittering city to find Jay? ADV set in the cyberpunk world. The main flow is that the player becomes the main character Nathan and travels to the future world with illegal hackers, outlaws, and low-tech cults in search of his lover Jay. The point-and-click method is adopted as the play system, and the main character Nathan is made to perform actions such as ""examine"", ""speak"", ""take"", and ""use"" by clicking an object on the screen, and uses items on the inventory. While solving the mystery, the story develops. As for solving the mystery, it is a little difficult, so it is necessary to carefully check Nathan's monologue, the behavior of the characters, and the journal. Play time is 8 to 10 hours. The progress is linear, but there are differences in the achievements that are canceled depending on the options. A cyberpunk dark pot game that is extraordinary, good or bad. ""VirtuaVerse"", which has the atmosphere of ""I tried to cook a rare masterpiece of ancient and modern east and west named"" Cyberpunk ""in my own way.

This work intentionally shuts out players who came in with a light feeling, such as the old-fashioned point & click method, the future world of pixel art that seems to be made by a sane person, and the heavy metal style synth sound that disturbs the peace of mind. To do. If this ""VirtuaVerse"" had been a compromised work by a weak developer, it would have been swiftly removed from the market, but don't worry. The passion that can be said to be the excess of the creators who fill ""VirtuaVerse"", its momentum like that, is unrivaled by about 100 cyberpunk ADVs. It can be said that this is the uniqueness of this work. Again, VirtuaVerse chooses a player. Still, the intense heat emitted by this work will attract a daredevil player like a trap light. Satisfaction above the price range was obtained. I recommend it. [GOOD] ・ A unique story, direction, and world view.・ A mystery-solving gimmick that brings depth and surprise. -Synth sound that sticks to your ears and never leaves.・ Very high level Japanese localization.

"I think for an online game that is trending for the first time in a long time, ""I hope they get Halal, they will reach larger audiences. I can make up the sentence. You ask why? Because Fall Guys is now stale, a production that succeeds in finding a gun after falling on the island and bringing a different breath to the games of trying to kill the nation and be the first. Fall Guys, who slapped the popular battleroyale rush of recent times, which does not contain episode design and gameplay depth in any way, actually tells us that you can go out of duplicate games. Yes, when you look at it, the logic is the same in Fall Guys. The goal is to stay to the end. But Fall Guys does this by making the elimination matches out of 60 people, making them the finals and choosing the winner. And this, along with it, gives the player a taste of many different game modes. Our game is a physics-based game in its own right, although not as much as a Human Fall Flat. With its tracks and games bouncing off from the Wipe Out competition, the potato kids in the sweet land of candy combine with very simple and easy to adapt gameplay. In this way, it manages to appeal to everyone, from young people to adults. With its many different game modes, it reaches a level that other battleroyale games cannot reach. He does not bore him by making the player do the same things, on the contrary, he puts a lot of different fun games and tracks in front of him. With its simple gameplay logic, it enables the player to adapt to the game in a short time. Since it finds a match immediately, it is a game that can be tried again and again. Actually, this part is a part filled with my personal ideas because the game does not have a big problem in sight. It is only sometimes possible to encounter server problems or minor bugs in some tracks, but aren't these the indispensable problems of every online game? Although it is a new game, I can add that they are also few in number. But once in a while, it is possible to come across cheaters (flying balances) in matches. This can sometimes miss the flavors after staying until the end. Personally, I don't like the soundtrack of the game, so I close and play the music. It is a matter of preference, but the extremely sweetish visuality of the game is also the kind that makes people hungry. Its bright colorful universe can also tire the eyes in long games. What Should Mediatonic Watch Out For After This Time? We congratulate Mediatonic for this outstanding success and thank you for saving us from poor quality productions that we cannot even call games. They caught a very good audience, but this game is a game that can survive only if it can update and renew itself constantly. This game requires new game modes, sponsorships with brands, new tracks. Otherwise, after 1 month, he can live the fate of For Honor. Now we live in a world where everything is very instantaneous and nothing is permanent. Therefore, if this game does not require innovation, it will exhaust itself very quickly. Finally; Among the online games I have played in my life, Fall Guys may be the one I played with the least anger. Compared to other platforms, Steam finds its price very affordable and I think it deserves that price. But of course, if you are one of those people who think that these inexhaustible bigoted, cartoon or animated productions are made for children, stay away. You can continue to live in your closed little world :) I wish you continued success Mediatonic. I hope you will be a cute game that reaches fortnite, pubg levels Fall Guys .. ",True,False

"Pretty Neko is a hentai title of the puzzle genre, which portrays in its art a character of the Neko style. It contains a total of twelve levels with puzzle images to assemble them correctly, however, the game is quite short and takes about 20 to 50 minutes to complete. The game does not have much difficulty in itself, because there is an option to move any piece from one row to another without having to move one by one, something that is not very common in games of the same style. In addition, there is also a censorship support, in which the player will need to download a free DLC that comes with game, to unlock the arts with adult content. Pretty has instrumental music with a very relaxing aspect, but unfortunately it is quite short and after a while it becomes quite repetitive. The mouse will be solely responsible for performing all functions within the game. In this way, Pretty Neko serves to target a specific audience and in a funnel way, due to the fact that it presents more specific content. Apart from the two negative aspects mentioned above, the game is able to successfully fulfill its proposal to be a simple puzzle with good arts, which can be easily recommended to the appropriate audience over 14 years old. • Colorful, well-made and detailed arts; • Practical menu; • In total 100 achievements; • Save to cloud. • Implement more songs; • Add new levels.

"This game is simply a gem it is a masterpiece. It's a game that didn't catch my eye from the beginning, but I decided to give it a try because I had heard their OST before that, ufff, is beautiful. The truth is that I exceed all my expectations of this genre of games, I normally are shooter games but this was my exception allowing me to open the doors to other similar titles. This game despite being a player you always feel accompanied, you immerse yourself too much in the story and it is very emotional. If you are very sensitive, it may even make you cry sometimes even laugh. In short it is one of the best games I have ever played. And its DLC is very good, I recommend acquiring it even if it does not connect directly to the story if it has a certain connection and too much action. And I loved its gameplay mechanics, it was the best and how they connected the action with its OST, uff really, it's the best I've played so far. Games like this have not been made for a long time, this game really touches your way of thinking and makes you think and ask yourself many things. And in the end, the message that this work of art leaves you is something that is presented in the real world in all its growth, something very cruel and something very beautiful too, but which is nevertheless our harsh reality. == SPOILER ALERT == * Note: Once you are playing, you need to worry about the ships. The most broken ships from my point of view are the auto-heal and offensive heal. Farm them on the path that is by Emil's house and you will have a ship of auto-heal 6 [14] and offensive heal you get it by passing the mission of the little robot that is under the bridge that connects from the ruins to the market going down from the waterfall from the forest you will find it very hidden.

"The Final Exam is a side-scrolling action game that allows up to 4 players to co-op and knock down creatures with melee weapons and guns while exploring the stage lightly. The first thing I liked about playing was the variety of melee attack combos and the exhilarating Bokosuka action. For example, after hitting a few enemies on the ground, you can float the enemy in the air with an upper attack, hit a few shots with an Erial and throw it in the air, and then shoot the floating part further to make a beehive, and a combo like Devil May Cry You can enjoy it. However, the true value of this game is a score attack that utilizes a unique combo bonus. The feature of the score system of this game is that if you attack without being attacked by the enemy, combos will accumulate and bonus points will be pooled more and more. Isn't it normal to get a high score as a bonus if you earn a combo without being attacked by the enemy? You may think that the final exam combo bonus miso is that the bonus score is only pooled until you press the bottom of the cross key to collect it, and only when you press the bottom of the cross key is it counted as a bonus score By the way. In other words, even if you defeat the enemy hard and earn combos to pool 1000 points and 10000 points, if you are hit by the enemy without collecting it, it will become a bubble of water. It is safe to collect bonus points diligently, but if you do so, your score will not increase, and if you accumulate too much and make water bubbles, it is meaningless. The bargaining of where to collect bonus points makes this game even hotter. By the way, the default setting is to automatically collect this bonus score. Please play with the manual collection setting to enjoy the score attack more. It's fun to compete with your friends in Coop play, and it's fun to aim for the top ranking in solo play. It's a game that can be enjoyed by one person as well as those who want to play Coop games with friends. ",True,False

"Many players, like me, are older, and many games can't be played anymore. After all, life is already not easy, so why bother with the game, so hard. But we love to play games and we need leisure and entertainment to adjust our lives. What should we do? Or the working people, who are usually busy with work, can only take a few breaks during the day, and have time to play when they return home from get off work. They can only stay away from the game of liver explosion. What games are suitable for this mainstream group of people? The idle game is just for the two needs, which came into being and gradually became popular. Recently, the epidemic in mainland China has been raging, the statutory annual leave has been postponed, and the traditional way of visiting relatives and friends has to be cancelled. Many players stay at home and are worried about how to pass the time. This type of game is really a tool for killing time. The graphics of this Endless World game are exquisite and the cartoon characters are also very distinctive, especially the optimization is excellent, and the configuration requirements are not high. I also indulged for a few days and found it very fun. I recommend it to everyone. Friends have paid attention to this game these days, and exchanged their experiences. In view of the lack of strategies for this game on the Internet, I will go back and write a little bit of experience and experience in the first few days, hoping to help novice players. , Take some detours and show your ugliness. To enter the game, first follow the novice guide to understand the general gameplay and game mechanics of this game. It is better to take a closer look when you have time. It is best not to omit it, so that you can get twice the result with half the effort. This game is similar to other idle idle games. The character will find the way automatically without the player controlling the map. Especially after turning on the Gaia Shield artifact, you can also turn on the automatic casting function, which is even more convenient. Normally, as long as you make good use of the equipment and gold coins obtained from the map, make the best use of it, synthesize the equipment in time, improve attributes, and the output from the map can support you to pass the map. For the players in the early stage, the game is not difficult. , You can play comfortably without spending money. Daily rewards are abundant. It is recommended to go online every day to complete daily tasks and remember to receive the activity treasure box. Please note that this game is quite special. The daily refresh time is set at 9pm Beijing time. The elemental restraint relationship of this game is: attribute restraint can cause 1.5 times damage, and restraint can only cause 0.75 times damage. The attributes of mercenaries are clear at a glance, and the writing is very clear. The attributes of the protagonist are related to the artifacts used for switching. The cataclysmic swords commonly used in tracing maps are fire fighters, Windrunner's Feather is a wind-based shooter, and Gaia's Shield is an earth-based tank. There are many ways to get diamonds in this game, and the benefits in the game are OK. At least monthly card players or even zero-krypton players can play. But the less you recharge, the more you have to plan carefully and you can't waste precious diamonds. If you are not a monthly card player with a lot of recharge, it is not recommended to go to the mercenary card pool to draw a special draw. Although this game mercenary is very important, many five-star mercenaries are very powerful, but the utilization rate of diamonds is too low and not economical. In this game, the tenth company of the inn only has a 4-star guarantee, and the feedback from the old customers of the 30th company only gives the guaranteed 5-star mercenary, which is really not cost-effective. Uh, except for the European Emperor. It is recommended to stay away from the inn in the upper right corner, and go to the store in the upper left corner to buy magic spar, upgrade the protagonist’s artifacts, open more advanced artifacts, not only can get rich daily income-daily free gift packs, each artifact can also unlock many new Function, see the new part in the artifact to understand. Secondly, every time you choose Time Reversal, there will be a 2-hour limited-time flop in the upper left corner. The first time is free, and the next flop requires diamonds. It is recommended to spend diamonds here. For players who don't recharge a lot, Gaoxing's useful mercenaries are all obtained here. Remember to refresh the shard pool with 20 diamonds before the flop. After the flop, you can no longer refresh the shard pool. At least refresh 2 useful 5-star mercenary shards and then go to the flop. Mercenary professions are divided into six types: tank, warrior, mage, auxiliary, archer and assassin. Because of the game settings, although the recent update added 10% damage to other melee occupations except tanks, it is still difficult to guarantee survival in the BOSS battle, and it is impossible to use mercenaries to cast skills and position, so Assassins and fighters in basic melee combat are rarely used to open up wasteland. As for tanks, they are rarely used. Generally, the protagonist is asked to switch Gaia's Shield to be a tank, which is convenient for players to manually operate to interrupt BOSS skills with control techniques. In addition to the protagonist in the game, you can also bring 4 mercenaries. The mercenary lineup can be divided into three types, one is the wasteland lineup, the second is the fast map lineup, and the third is the PK lineup. Different lineups have different mercenaries. Although low-star mercenaries can also increase their stars through the evolution in the training, the initial low-star mercenaries are still much weaker than the high-star mercenaries. Most of them have evolved to 5 stars and become other high-star mercenaries. The evolution of dog food. For the novice land reclamation, it is recommended that the protagonist switch the Gaia Shield artifact to make a tank. You can interrupt the BOSS skills, and all others are remote, mage, support, and archer. If your long-range mercenary is not good, you can bring an extra tank, such as the 5-star tank Warnier, which will be invincible and will be sent to you the next day. The best regular lineup of novices during the pioneering period: If you don't have Cassandra, you can switch to the 4-star mercenary Lily, and the healing ability is also very good. Pandora, Hornibel and Huiyue Fox are also common, but because they all have wonderful skills, they are more used for PK, and their control skills are unpredictable and unpredictable. Currently the hottest lineup: The protagonist switches the warrior’s cataclysmic sword artifact, and then sends 4 15-level sources. The skill reverts quickly, and it is melee. Parkour is the fastest to pass the map. Please note that this game can play the same mercenaries. If you don't draw other powerful mercenaries, but draw two evas, then get 2 evas at the same time. In addition, many of the skills of mercenaries in this game are not instant, and they have time to read. For example, Warnier's ultimate can only be invincible after 2 seconds. There is no universal lineup, and in many cases, a leader or opponent is needed to target. In addition, what is written here is the current strong lineup, which does not mean that the game will be changed in the future. If you are still stuck and can’t beat the boss at the bottom of the level, you can see if your equipment has not been synthesized in time, the attributes have not been added, the equipment and attributes are behind, or there is a blue color on the right side of the boss in the UI at the top of the game interface. ""!"" button, you can click in to see the attributes and skills of the BOSS, and then according to the attribute restraint principle set by the game, use the artifact of Xiangke to deal with it. If the BOSS skill is too strong and you can't stand it, you might as well operate it manually to interrupt the BOSS skill. If you still can't beat it, you can wait until the map is brushed to the powerful blessing tower, and get the powerful buff before going to the boss to fight to the death. Not yet? Then click on the ""Blessing of the Moon"" hourglass at the top of the interface UI to see if the bottleneck has been reached, and the difficulty has been increased too much. If there is still room for energy, you can brush a little more equipment and gold coins on this layer, and then look for it. BOSS revenge. At present, the ""Offline Push Off"" function is available in the game. Click the settings on the right, and after entering and selecting to turn on, sometimes turn off the game, take a break when offline, and go online later, sometimes it can help you pass the level. There are three copies of this game: Founder’s Treasure (Equipment Copy), Brave Dungeon (Mercenary Copy) and Legendary Golden Forest (Gold Coin Copy). Because it requires two items, rare teleport stones and ordinary teleport stones. The treasure of the foundry also requires rare teleportation stones, so it is only recommended to hit the brave dungeon. The mercenary fragments given here, 100 fragments can be used to synthesize mercenaries, but the mercenaries need diamonds to draw cards, which is the most cost-effective. Do not rush to play the dungeon at first, wait until you are about to reincarnate, so that the various values ​​have reached your peak, then play again, fast and good, to ensure that you pass the level. When you finish brushing the rare teleportation stone, you can't enter the mercenary copy, and then go to the gold coin copy. The gold coin copy only needs the ordinary teleportation stone to enter. Although this game is called an idle game, it actually requires some operations. Especially the few obstacles that novice players encountered in the early stage, and a few plot BOSS, need a little manual operation to clear the level. In fact, to put it plainly, as long as you know the rules of the BOSS skills in this game, you only need to practice more later, and practice makes perfect, and there is no difficulty. Most of the elite monsters and bosses in this game are there. Below the UI interface, there is a yellow rage bar, and there are two blue flames beside it. As long as the yellow bar is fully charged, the yellow rage bar will be cleared. A red guide bar appeared again, and the skill began to be cast. Some special plot BOSS, this kind of big move damage is amazing, basically can kill the character of the novice player in seconds. The way to deal with it is to find that the yellow rage bar is full and empty, and the red casting guide bar appears, promptly interrupt it with a skill that can make the boss move or stun, so that it is safe. It is recommended that the protagonist choose Gaia's Shield, the artifact of the tank. The control skills are many and the CD is short. The ice girl at level 270: Pay attention to the black water circle of the big devil next to you. You will die if you go in, so you can't get in more and more. Instead, it's better to pull out and fight. You can let the protagonist choose the archer artifact, press W, which is the 2 skill hook, to pull the BOSS out, then switch the tank artifact, press E, which is the 3 skill, rush to the back of the ice girl, and then switch the archer artifact, and use Q, which is the skill 1 This will be foolproof. Blue Fat at level 330: Highly damage AOE skills, switch tank artifacts, and interrupt when cast. Or switch the archer artifact, hit more long range, cast AOE and use skills to hit far. 450 level fire dragon: switch the tank artifact, do not pay attention to the fire dragon skills, pay attention to pull the monster to the side or the rear, do not let the dragon AOE skills hit the back row. Every time the fire dragon’s yellow bar is full and the red bar is cleared and the red bar is used to cast a skill, it immediately interrupts it with a skill of the protagonist. The shortcut key is Q. So as long as you can hold back and don't use a skill at will, you can still pass the level easily when the fire dragon uses a large move and then interrupts it in time. Sometimes the small skills of the fire dragon will also read the article, just pay attention to the distinction. When the reading bar is cast, the yellow rage bar will be cleared. There are many small skills in hand exercises, such as switching artifacts at any time during battle. When the protagonist’s blood volume is critical, his ultimate is awakened. Everyone knows to quickly order blood. Indeed, being a wolf can not only suck blood and increase the attack speed, but also reduce the anger of surrounding monsters. But when pulling the BOSS, the tank artifacts are switched, and the tank attack speed is too slow, even if you wake up, you can't suck up the blood. If the protagonist is not under pressure to survive, you can switch to the warrior artifact first, and then click Awaken. The attack speed is very fast, and a large amount of health can be restored. When the awakening is complete, switch back to the tank artifact to pull monsters. By the way, during the awakening period, only the basic attack can suck blood, and the cast skills cannot suck blood. There is a bug when switching artifacts during awakening. Another example is that the protagonist has eaten a lot of damage and has problems with subsequent survival. You might as well switch the archer artifact and quickly use the Q and E skills to shoot back the leader, and then you can maintain a safe output distance, which is better than being killed and lying on the ground. You can explore more skills on your own to increase the fun of the game, so I won’t list them all. Generally speaking, there are two types. One is the average attribute type, which can be upgraded to the top with one click, so that the protagonist is a cylinder warrior, a versatile type. The second one I highly recommend is that after the early basic four-dimensional attributes are added, the main defense attributes are added, and the attack and life are supplemented. The remaining toughness and crit are not or less. In this way, the protagonist is cultivated into a real tank career, and the meat shield is resisted, the survival of the subsequent output is guaranteed, and the output is only alive. After all, in this game, even if the BOSS is violent, the damage will not be too explosive, and the main defense effect is immediate, and most situations can be easily dealt with. As for the time reversal, as long as the time reversal challenge rewards are exhausted, the blessing of the moon is also exhausted, and it is very hard to pass the picture. If you often get stuck in the picture, then go bold. Of course, if you are particularly budget-conscious, you can check the elegant gradient (purple wine) reward in Time Reversal, and try to get it before you turn. And there are many reversals in time and many flop opportunities. For microkrypton players, this is the biggest benefit for getting high-level mercenaries. Don't forget, remember to prepare at least 1,000 diamonds for the flop before the reversal. By the way, go to the dungeon and the arena before turning. At this time, your attributes reach the top, which is the best time for this day. The other thing is to put the best equipment into the time storage box and don't waste any resources. By the way, remember to spend 150 diamonds every day to buy a time key. Purchase from the ""+"" sign in the lower left corner of the time dial in the time reversal interface. Of course, in the token exchange refreshed in the store every day, remember to buy time keys with flowers. Soon you will be short of keys, the time reversal dial is dissatisfied, it is impossible to reverse the light. As you all know, if you want to forge gold in this game, you first need to open a gold illustration book. So in the game, it is difficult to synthesize gold equipment by collecting equipment from monsters. How to get the gold outfit? Krypton gold bosses can naturally go to the store-adventure store-equipment box to buy diamonds directly, but it is not recommended here. Here is a way to make gold equipment for civilians: Click on the equipment in the lower left corner, and then click forging to make it. Someone wants to say, I just don’t have a gold outfit illustration book, so how do I make a gold outfit? Don’t worry, take your time, you first forge 3 green equipment, then 3 green equipment into blue, then continue to forge 2 blue equipment of the same name, 3 blue and then purple, and finally 3 purple Pretend to be golden so that the golden equipment comes out. Please note: Be sure to choose the same level of equipment to forge. Otherwise it can't be synthesized. In addition, in the early stage of the gold equipment, there is no need to think too much. Usually, it can be synthesized according to the current drop of the level. Also need to pay attention to is that forging a gold armor, the magic iron to spend money is expensive, don't play with low-level equipment, magic iron is a scarce resource. If it's not a heirloom with particularly good attributes, don't spend too much magic iron to upgrade. It's far better to wait for 10 levels and forge high-level equipment directly. Finally, let’s talk about the recommended order for improving combat power: Moon’s Blessing (Hourglass) level, more artifacts, artifact level, mercenaries, and equipment at the end. This refers to the key indicators that can permanently increase combat power. The current problem with this game is that there are often bugs in pathfinding, and then it prompts failure. Although there is no loss after failure, it will automatically continue, but it hangs well, and it is always unhappy. The other is that the server often freezes, which is even more unbearable. I hope developers can fix BUG and improve server quality. In the future, when launching events, while considering paying players, we can give microkrypton and zero krypton players more benefits and development space, so that all players can enjoy the fun of this game, and everyone is happy. Okay, this is the end of this guide for newbie players. If there are any unclear points, you can go to the official group of the game and ask the big guys. The group number can be found in the help on the right side of the game. In addition, there will be some small benefits every month, such as the redemption code of some small gift packages.

"Hello, I'm Charley Tank and if you don't know who I am then I'm a Tester for nanos the creator of JC3MP. I have been playing this wonderful game Since before the first public beta it has come a long way since that day. I have spent countless hours recording videos on the test server I also Recorded the Trailers for the Beta release and the Steam release so I'm quite Familiar to this wonderful game. This is a video of scrapped trailer footage some made it and some didn't but it was all so fun to record and I would do it again over and over 10 times. I actually have a lot of good things to say about this Multiplayer Mod because I got to play with it before the public not just because of that but I made a lot of new friends becoming a tester  (Thank you Protato) I have sacrificed a little to gain so much and for that, I have to Thank Nanos & Square Enix. I have tested the Multiplayer Mod on 10 different computers with 10 totally different settings from an i5 3570k with a single GTX 660Ti right up to my latest build an i9 7900x with a 1080Ti the same results on every test sure there are some bugs but nanos works on these with every new patch and it's getting better and better the game is playable and stable this is a live stream I did on launch day. I have done over 47 videos on the Multiplayer and have never had so much fun in all my life on Any game as I have had on Just Cause 3 Multiplayer. I play on Gaveroids Just Cause 3 Multiplayer server not because they put my name in the game but because that's where all my friends play I appreciate everything nanos has done for me if your a real Just cause 3 fan like me try out the Multiplayer you will see what kind of mayhem you can cause there are so many different possibilities so many ideas, road trips - cargo plane air force -  mountain climbing - you name it you can do it. I have been stunting trying a lot of different things on the Multiplayer The DLC servers are the best mech fight with 50 People? what are you waiting for stop reading this and hop on the Multiplayer? You can't have this kind of fun on any other game but Just Cause 3 Multiplayer. I have well over 1500 hours on Just Cause 3 Single player I will get triple that on the Multiplayer.

"Review-story: Honestly, I don't even know where to start. [These games came into my possession thanks to the quarantine period, and also because of the boredom of playing shooters myself.] Let it be concrete: for me the whole series of ""The Witchers"" is an absolute masterpiece. I started with the first part, sure that I will not play the other two until I buy new equipment, because the famous Radeon 520 was frying to me at the sight of a bonfire in W1 [of course on the lowest ones], but the whole adventure turned out to be so addictive, so great that I decided to go the other two parts on a fucking pathetic 10fps, where it was really going to get a stroke from how it all cooked ... I don't regret it. If you are looking for a game that is great in terms of plot, because I personally touched me more than once, much more than the famous Life is Strange. Why? Because everything here comes out so naturally, many decisions can have completely unpredictable results, it is ... Life, real, not by force. It shows everyday, heart-breaking dilemmas against an unusual background. As Bloody Baron said, ""Nothing is black and white."", The character that is the best example of the non-linearity of this piece. At first thought to be a bastard, it eventually caused a torrent of tears. And surely, if you want to smash with monsters and feel strength, improve your dexterity in various tactics, combine them with potions - you will find a huge amount, nothing stands in the way, but when you get over it; you will see that you missed about 80% of the value this game conveys. It cannot be described, and I do not want to explore the technique itself. Is it enjoyable? Of course. Is it easy to use? Hour and you navigate efficiently on the interface. To sum up: Such a good plot, exquisite, even perfect humor, and landscapes that we will be able to visit on our silent companion Płotka, the absurd and unique rescue of the ""princess"", the poignant history of Janek's pile, a lot of difficult choices, their sometimes brutal consequences, over which I have been wondering for a long time in terms of their rightness and the attachment that I have built to the character of Geralt is something that I would buy with full awareness, even without a discount, for the PLN 100. And I am stiff. ",True,False
"In the Game of CK III you win or you die... Ok, most probably you will die quite often anyway, but as long as you have a good heir your dynasty will live on, and that´s what counts. With the improved Legacy bonus for Dynasties even more now than before. This is actually one - of quite many - improvements they have included in the third installement of the game. From the lifestyle focus trees for each character to the Dynasty, Faith and Culture trees, you have now much more influence on how to develop.. which also is easier to understand and plan imo. Also down to every character attribute they have much more influences on many decisions ingame.  Besides this, the gameplay is very much like the second part of course, you make Marriages and Alliances to rise in the world. Then you die by gout or someone murders you.. through accident.  The things which are a bit annoying so far are a bad overview at the map level, especially in warfare.. often you don´t even see your armies anymore, because the map view changed for some reason.  The warfare itself also got a bit improved, with specialised troop types, which add to your normal levies. The overview is in part the biggest problem, since the news snippets plop up and go away again, i have not seen much options for changing them.. or reading older ones. Also windows close automatically, when you click a news which makes you open them up again and again. Otherwise regarding bugs the game seems mostly stable and in working order, especially for this fresh stage of release. The music can be still much improved (in comparison to CKII), but is not annoying at least.  Conclusio: Looking forward to many more centuries of crusading ;) - No, honestly, if you liked the second part, get it.. and even if it was too complicated, you can risk a glance, since in my opinion it got quite a bit easier to understand and transparent. Score 9/10 ",True,False
"even with its changes and problems related to combat and its artificial intelligence, bugs in the scenario and other details that can be corrected with updates, the defects present in Skyrim do not take away from its strongest points: the feeling of freedom and the narrative.

"I like it. A well-told story, albeit without much intrigue. You are watching the narration from the side, in fact, are not any of the specific characters. Because of this, the emphasis shifts to dialogue rather than action. And they are spelled out perfectly, with a grain of seriousness and humor. The camera work and transitions are generally great. Despite the flaws in the graphics, what the operator creates from angles ... mmm, a fairy tale. Every dialogue is felt. Everything is built on conversations, in essence you just sit and listen to the chatter of the characters. You are not even an outside observer, as if you are not in the world of the game. And for this a lot of information is pronounced ""as is"", without explanation. Also, the narration is quite equal, there is no protagonist as such, there is only a general storyline. That is why they do not reveal much about the characters; it is like a set of small scenes of ""everyday life of the necrobarist"". Because of this, the story seems unsaid, a lot of things happen as if “behind the scenes.” It is impossible to fully feel the joy or sadness of the characters. All this would look great in the form of a movie, without these freeze frames in the form of the need to press the space bar. But this is still a game, and I would like more immersion as a hero of the story. However, this is a lack of a narrative format, so not for an amateur. What is really a miscalculation is the lack of voice acting. This is what the game sorely lacks in character voices. It's just like watching a movie without a voice, but with subtitles and music. This format requires voice acting. In general, I advise you to try, definitely do not waste your time. ",True,False

"Initially, I was disappointed in the map being largely covered by an inhospitable mountain range. Still, it's content and scenery made up for this. Elsweyr continues the adventure that started with the Wrathstone DLC and is noteworthy for it's introduction of the Necromancer Class, making this expansion highly desirable. Elsweyr features several new recipes across the crafting portfolio including jewellery, effecting Homestead, trading, combat - which indicates a respectable amount of work detail and creativity. The main quest continues into the Dragonguard DLC. Upon it's completion a bloody great host of quests becomes available.  There's another free house that's unlocked through the year long story line. You will have the best time zerg-ing the enormous dragons or World Bosses here.  To summarise, highly recommended for fans of the Elder Scrolls - get into it. ",True,False

"I don't know if to call this a game, rather it is a journey through the feelings and thoughts of the developer. Sometimes it is shown metaphorically, other times it is said directly in phrases like ""You need to give up"" or ""Your work is never enough."" The purpose of the game is to show the player the sadness and burden of the developer, and in my opinion, it is not a bad attempt. Although the use of Unity is something basic, and there are levels that are not entirely clear Awkward Dimensions is an experience that is worth a couple of minutes, and without a doubt any player who knows how to enjoy a somewhat sad and well-set experience should try it.

"shadow of war .. Our distinguished game that takes up 110 GB of space. Human ""Lord of the Rings series author of Tolkien did you put in the game?"" does not ask: D anyway, let's move on to our review. the game is visually successful, I liked the graphics very much. the farther you look, the better it looks. personalizing the character ispositive. The captain thing is also extraordinary, especially when you are running from one place to another, they jump up and bring you to the kundi and go to war from there puts the man in a good mood. but I wish their orcs didn't write in Scottish comedian mood. Think of the orcs trying to stand up in the middle of the war: D you get it. This breaks the dark theme of the game a little. you suddenly feel like you are in the hobbit universe, not the lotr. The fighting mechanics of the game are simply EF SA NE. I don't even remember which game was the last time I had such fun while fighting. You can make fun combat by improving your character with various upgrades. Riding the dragon and caragor is an extremely enjoyable event, I cannot help but mention it. Especially in this kind of big map games, mounting is very important for me. Executing with caragor, climbing walls, smashing orcs' heads etc. is a great pleasure. I can vouch that you will enter after you finish the game just to relieve stress. let's come to the story .. I can't call it perfect, but it has been adapted properly for the lotr universe. The finale did not satisfy me at all, let's see if the new game will come, how will the story of ranger talion continue? If you still haven't played this great AAA game at this price, I strongly recommend you to play it, if you are interested in the medieval and lotr universe you will definitely love it, or you will start to be interested. :) 8.3 / 10 ",True,False

"10tons (the developer) is showing some really good business practices with Tesla vs Lovecraft. They took an amazing but outdated game, Crimsonland, and instead of ""reskinning"" it and releasing it with Lovecraft themed monsters, they built upon their successful game design, creating an even smoother gaming experience.  Tesla vs Lovecraft has a decent sized campaign (3 hours) which is a series of small maps you have to clear of monsters and can be replayed on 2 higher difficulties while keeping all of your upgrades. Instead of a vast empty space like in Crimsonland, here each map is small and packed with obstacles some of which destructible. This allows for a more tactical gameplay because you can lure the monsters in tight alleys or corners and release Tesla's electric wrath upon them. Your ability to teleport and call in a mechanical suit allow you to plow through your enemies and quickly disengage when you're outnumbered. This makes the gameplay far more dynamic and a bit more casual (on the first difficulty at least, it becomes much harder afterwards). The DLC is adequatly priced and fully optional as it is mostly aimed at hard-core fans. ",True,False

"Hood. I just wanted to tell you one thing, I really liked this installment, seriously, it is the most sensational I have seen so far, it is a work of art, without exaggeration, it is something that, at first glance, could have been done by Da Vinci himself, his genius can be noticed from miles away, not even the worst of bad tongues could say that we are not faced with a majesty seen only once in a thousand years. I have not seen in all my years of life something of this magnitude, it causes you an indescribable sensation, an immense joy despite not having done any action, a rare feeling to find but fantastic, something like what a breeze feels like in a hot summer, or see the joy of a child when opening their Christmas gifts, or simply be with that person we love so much. Do not listen to the gossip who criticize incessantly anyone who does not meet absolutely all their expectations, just believe me and all those beings who consider and admire such a great work of art. There will always be people who are going to tell you that what you did has no value, but the secret is to ignore them, those people would give anything to have created something as magnificent as what we are seeing. Just as God in his infinite wisdom created humanity, or as a man in love creates a poem to express his deepest feelings, or as a painter creates a work of art from some time that even he does not know, this is how it was created this excellent game, in the same way. It may seem that I am exaggerating, I repeat, but it is not like that, not even close, I would exaggerate if I said that I am not before an admirable, incredible creation, of a beauty of biblical proportions. In fact I am so delighted with such a contribution that I decided to write a poem about it, it is titled ""my eyes thank you"", here it goes: - ""My eyes thank you, since they have been caressed, my feelings praise you, since They have been awakened, my heart idolizes you, because you have made him dance, and my being says thank you, for such a delicious delicacy, I will be waiting again, for you to share your joy, even in the middle of the night, or in the most radiant day Just keep creating, creating until your hands are heavy, so I'll tell you again, my eyes thank you ""-. I hope you enjoyed my poem as much as I enjoyed writing it, I would say that you enjoy it as I enjoyed your magnificent game, but I don't think there is a situation in the world that resembles so much happiness. To finish being brief, I wanted to thank you from the bottom of my heart, one in this life encounters situations that make him feel bad, he thinks that he is not going to find anything good these days and suddenly he comes across something like that, it is difficult to decide where one is going to leave its positives, and in fact it is already tiring to report most of the games that you see lately, I feel that many are created by trolls and people wanting to annoy, nothing to do with what we are observing, here one thinks everything On the contrary, he simply sees it and says to himself ""there must be no place on this earth, neither in the sky nor in the underworld, nor in other planets, galaxies or universes, where it is better to leave my points, I have found the real Atlantis Although it is not a physical place, its simple beauty is enough not to hesitate to make such a comparison. "" Sometimes I wonder how much skill or how much skill it takes to be able to make a creation of this nature, sometimes I compare myself with the creators of beauties like this and I think that I am not even a simple human being, next to these creators I I feel like an ant in front of an imposing elephant, like a pawn next to a queen, like a child in front of a superhero from these comics that you like to read so much. Sometimes I look up to the sky and ask ""Can I create something that, at least, can be compared to this beautiful game?"" ""Can I ever be as cool, creative and talented as the creator of this? ""What must one do in this life to achieve such genius?"" But no matter how much I ask and ask, I never get an answer. Sometimes I dream that I wake up and in front of me, next to my bed, there is a game like this, but in my dream it has something different, the creator is me. Yes, I know it seems crazy, something as glorious as this cannot be created by a simple being like me, but we must not forget that it is only a dream. If I could make a wish, that would be that this game never leave the store, that future generations can observe its magnificence and be filled with happiness with what they see, filled with happiness, madness, passion ... If all games of the world were like this, there would be no wars, there would be no pain, forgetfulness, sadness. We would raise our heads and singing a song in unison, like a choir of archangels we would say: ""I believe in tomorrow"" ",True,True

"I finished the game in 4.5 hours. You can finish in this time unit roughly because of the sections. I can say that the atmosphere of the game is absolutely magnificent. So much so that it puts you in different emotions throughout the game and actually processes the history of humanity as subtext (we don't have any tools at first, we fight with animals, there are animal traps because it is a hunting period, then we meet people, etc.) After you finish the game, you may want to play it again and again. The reason why our character in the game is a child is that Limbo, Hz. The place where children who lived before Christ and died before they could be baptized. According to Christianity, Limbo is the 1st floor of hell. There is no fire, but only emptiness. Those children will remain in this space forever. Considering the game with this information, it would not be wrong to say that the game we play is a ""masterpiece"". 10/10. ",True,False

"Left 4 Dead 2 is a zombie survival game, but with no focus on horror, you can choose between four characters, Ellis, Rochelle, Nick and Coach. Regarding the arsenal you have about 14 firearms, 11 melee weapons and 3 different types of desserts available. There are 7 game modes and among them there is the ""Mutation"" mode, and it completely changes the way you would play the normal campaign, speaking of the campaign in total there are 13 campaigns available to play with the characters from the second and first games . It is possible to play the campaign alone in a local game or to play online with randoms which I DO NOT recommend since in most games I tried to play with people who were not my friends it didn't end well since most were making fun of the game of others or using hacks to disrupt other players. Left 4 Dead 2 is a very good survival shooting game that I highly recommend. More if you want to play with four players instead of playing alone with three bots call your friends or play locally with a friend on your computer, which is a possible thing to do in this game and many people don't know.

(Spoiler the most effective module is green lasers) And so the game is not bad - tauver defchik - like a space run - we have a ship - there are places for turrets - choose turrets and a set of weapons to complete the mission - but everything rolls down to FUCKING GREEN TURRIES. And tactics played more in space run and there were more turrets and additional support modules justified themselves. And here is where the blea file is - with such a game there should be a file so that you finish the game for yourself. I end up with 5 and +1 in the hope of a sequel. If it will be me the first who will buy. Results 6 from 10 And the game is unfinished - not in terms of bugs - but in terms of balance.

"A mixture of farm and RPG. A surprisingly good mix. For a long time nothing made me so happy and did not make me forget that I still have some business to do. On the good in order: This is the end of the heading why it is worth buying it, let's move on to the impression. The first thing we do is create our protagonist. Here the first ambush awaited me. I always had a problem with the choice, especially in games, to choose this path or that, use or save until better times, a red jacket or that black one. So, there are a little more than 100 shirt options here. I skipped them all three times and already cursed the creator (), but still choosing something black, I went in search of adventure, and to be precise, quitting my job, went to study my inheritance ... So, we get an abandoned farm, can you imagine what it is? Overgrown by the most ... uh, tomatoes. With a bunch of stones and other delights of rural life. A set of tools is given to help. And everything. EVERYTHING. Now hammer yourself into a stone, into a tree, bite into this soil and make your farm become something beautiful, not a house abandoned many years ago. In short, we, friends, are in a gigantic ... mine. There is a lot to do, at first there are few nishtyaks, and the pleasure simply cannot be measured, seriously. Coupled with a nice picture, no soundtrack, the author wrote down an incredible variety of activities, a nice village, cute characters, as well as tasks that help not to get stuck and give an understanding of what to do next. As a result, I advise everyone and everyone, except people who hate pixels. ",True,False

"This game from Sigma Team is an easy to pick isometric shooter.  Despite it's age and graphics, the fun factor is great.  Also, the small but effective improvements you can buy allow you a bit of customisation  on the gameplay style.  Different weapons ARE different, and you have to be careful with reload times.  Hordes and hordes of aliens come to get you. You can also use the environment on your favor, like doors , corridors ans such.  Sound assests are good. When you mix aliens with explosions, grenade launchers and mayhem,  it gets really really rewarding. Usually this game along with others (from Sigma Team) appear on bundles,  or heavily discounted not only on steam but also in other sites (i.e. Indie Gala).  When you are bored, and want a quick and mindless session you can fire a chapter , or even play a survival session.  Play it with v-sync off, to avoid some problems.  It runs on a toaster, so it's perfect for those (like me) that have ancient hardware around. ",True,False

"Alright, who's here because of brutalmoose? Despite his rather harsh review, my curiosity got the best of me, and thus here I am. So is this game truly awful, or is there more to the story? Let's start with the basics. Chantelise is an action adventure game that's somewhat of a JRPG as well, for reasons we'll get into soon. A quick gander might lead you to think that this is a long-lost PS1 game, judging by the graphics and sound. However, Chantelise is actually an indie game from 2006, back when the indie scene was far less established. So whether by necessity and/or conscious design choice, the overall style is technically only one or two generations old, which makes it rather unique today. I find the 2D-like sprites and low polygon count quite charming, and the accompanying sounds are the same way. It's just something you don't see often, as it's not ""retro"", nor is it realistic. Fortunately, the horrible pixelation you see on many PS1 games is smoothed out, and the audio quality is decently better as well. The hand-drawn characters are pretty good, though nothing super special. All in all, save for a couple frame drops, Chantelise feels like a slightly remastered game from the late 90's, and that's pretty neat. So then, what is this tale of two sisters about? In short, older sister Chante has been turned into a fairy, and so she flies alongside her younger sister Elise as they look to undo the curse. They come across a caring shopkeeper named Aira, as well as an enigmatic fortune teller named Elma, among others. From there, the sisters venture through four elemental-themed dungeons (plus a final place) as they discover the truth behind their legend. It's certainly not the most profound story, but it does work well through its own simplicity. There's plenty of whimsy to be had as well, particularly on Chante's behalf. She's always making wisecracks, while Elise balances her out with sweetness. I think the localization is especially good at making this work, as each of those one-liners are delivered just perfectly. It really speaks volumes how a competent translation can do wonders. I was invested in the story, even if it wasn't groundbreaking. Now for the real meat of the review: how does Chantelise play? You control Elise as she moves around a 3D space, attacks enemies with her sword, and uses Chante for magic. Levels consist of small screens with unique challenges and enemies, all with a boss screen at the end. That's where the action and adventure parts come in, though I'm not sure if I'd call it an RPG. Stats are only managed on a basic level, and there's no real progression system, save for plot advancements. The money you collect from enemies functions somewhat as experience points, which you exchange for equipment and HP levels (which you need to do often). Equipment is also gained in dungeons by doing certain tasks. It's a cool idea in concept, as it encourages you to play around in each screen, but the conditions are arbitrary, and ultimately it's better to use a guide to get everything. While these treasures are optional, you'll really need them to keep up with the game's difficulty, which is very unforgiving, particularly without preparations. Many people say this game is hard, perhaps too hard, and I can't blame them for thinking so. Some players may resort to grinding, though it'll only get you so far. You'll have to adapt to lots of obstacles in your adventure, and they won't be easy. Oddly enough, the first boss is probably the second most difficult in the game (that final boss, yikes), and it's no wonder why so many give up at that point. Another issue I had is that the camera is very unwieldy. While more manageable with a controller, it's tough to lock onto enemies and let go when needed. I eventually got used to it, but it took time, and I still had issues throughout the game. Once you can get past the issues, the game has a nice rhythm to it, but expect to mess up often. I'd say it's not for everyone, but if you can put in some effort and forgive some esoteric choices, there's fun to be had. Well then, is Chantelise a good game? To me, it was fun despite some problems. You really have to be patient and understanding with the game, which may not make it enjoyable to some people. I think the fun story makes for a good driving force to continue though. If you think Chantelise is the type of game you might enjoy, it probably is. Chantelise certainly isn't a masterpiece, but I can't help but feel it's at least better than the critics told us. ",True,False

"The Walking Dead: Season Two is a sequel to the famous adventure video game The Walking Dead. Here, too, there are 5 episodes, each of which will bring its turn in the story and a certain unraveling. Like the first part, the game adheres to basic techniques, so we have dialogues in the game, where we try to decide in the time limit for the best answer that suits us, or fundamental decisions. At the same time, the game offers the function to import the decisions you made in the first part and thus slightly affect the sequel. For those who do not have the first part or saved positions have long ago erased the story offers generated decisions. In Season Two, Clementine's influence on the current world in which she lives, both mentally and physically, is strongly visible. Clementine is now more or less ready to take care of herself. I will not give positive or negative here, because the game looks and works the same as in the first one, just with a different story, which is also great and this part offers you more endings.

"Quick Intro: The game is based in a steampunk medieval time. You are a Swordsman (sorry Fighter) after realising halfway through the game you are a female protagonist lol, who is wanting to prove her worth and become a part of the league of fighters and will do anything to protect her village. Graphics: The artwork and scenes in he entire game are beautiful and well designed, it may look basic but it’ll always want you to keep on playing and see what more monster designs, quest, bosses, and other heroes you will get to see along the way.  As for the important part the game runs very smoothly and even on laptops so no need to play worry if you wanted to play it as you won’t be needing a 4k high spec computer. Gameplay: The game is designing to be half Final Fantasy and Half Yugioh. It’s a turn-based game where each Character is allowed up to 8 cards, through the battle system you can use cards, to protect, boost or Attack. With many different cards and variations, the game become lot of fun as you start to explore different cards for your characters. Customising your deck to make certain characters brawler, mages, and “back up dancers “I mean Support. Not much else should be said as if you are a fan of turn-based and card games then I will leave the secrets for players who would like to purchase this game and explore for themselves.  Advantages: No matter what level you are at gaming, this game is brilliant for Beginners and for Advances players as the tutorial explain it very clearly how to play the game, help give you tips and combinations, so that when you reach chapter 3 you will be a professional at playing this game, discovering new combos, strategies and tactics. Disadvantages: Nothing negative to say about this game as I need to play more of it to see if there are bugs or errors in the game except you can say the game is alittle pricey for now but with Steam sales, if its low in price I would buy it. Overall: I would recommend this game is any fan of yugioh or Final Fantasy as you will have a blast and enjoy the concept of the game. I’d rate this game a 8/10. Hope you all enjoy this review Peace out. ",True,False

"This work tells the story of Athena (one of the protagonists) being captured and recalling Jack's fall. The content of the game is actually memories. The event took place on the moon with low gravity, so players can enjoy the pleasure of jumping several meters. Some guns have bonuses for shooting in the air. In order to adapt to the environment without oxygen, this work introduces an oxygen mask, which is a good innovation. In addition to oxygen supply, the hood can also launch a shock, which can be launched by squatting up to a certain height. But personally think it is not practical. This work also added laser gun and ice element damage. The laser gun is not the kind of alloy warhead. I personally feel it is a rifle with a relatively high rate of fire and accuracy. The ice element is more interesting. When shooting, there is a chance to freeze the enemy and restrict their actions. The physical damage taken by the frozen enemy will increase. Occupation adds a little noise, which makes people shine, I heard that it is very interesting. But I only tried Athena, and the shield is also quite interesting. The skill tree is more team-oriented than the second generation. Generally speaking, the prelude did not reach the height of Borderless 2. The main line is shorter and the branch line is much less. The difficulty is lower, and there are fewer boss fights. The plot is not bad, filling many gaps, the addition of the protagonist's monologue is great. The original price is not cost-effective, it is recommended to wait for a discount. Players who want to play the Masterless series can try 1, 2 first. ",True,False

"Exodus has a great story that closes Artyom's saga and his fight together with his companions for a better life! The gameplay has had some modifications compared to the previous ones, but nothing that doesn't get used quickly. Its main campaign is focused on the stealth and without violence (if you want the real ending) and a lot of exploration and fighting. The graphic is beautiful, as expected, however ... that's where the problems came from! First, there is a serious problem involving Direct X 12, many crashes will happen and sound bugs where out of nowhere it disappears or ""crashes"" totally and that can even affect Windows! Bizarre!! To improve this situation it is recommended to play in Direct X 11 and this will decrease significantly, despite the 2 battles I had against the ""boss"" of the Taiga map, there was a gigantic lag that was only resolved when this ""boss"" killed him (and never happens again). Apart from this situation, in the game you will find objects and / or enemies ""floating"", when you get the car and use the diary / map inside it, your vision will go up, almost on the ceiling and to return to normal just open the diary again /map. There is also the rendering problem: on the same screen you will see the same object well rendered and another not (example: the rocks of a mountain, one well rendered and one on the other side). With all this, do not be discouraged, as the game is very good and very worthwhile, but be prepared to face technical problems that have not been solved until today! ",True,False

"Wanting to become a kungfu master but lack the physical training? Fear not, now you can become the best kungfu master ever!  One finger death punch is a simple brawler that requires only 2 keys to play (left and right). There is no complicated hard to pull off combos to memorize here. Show your mastery in kungfu by pressing the right key at the right time as hordes of enemies come rushing at you from both sides. Certain enemies such as the boss will take multiple hits to kill, while other enemies carry weapons which they may throw or shoot at you if you are not being careful. On the other hand, you can also grab these weapons dropped from your enemies to use, for example, a gun with enable you to shoot (effectively killing enemies normally outside of your melee range). As you play through the levels, you can earn gems to unlock skills, such as slowing down the time or increasing your range of attack. All very helpful to help you kick their asses harder.

"Hello guys. I just come to make a brief comment about this game, because for me it is an example of how the game industry has evolved in such a short time. Here even though many may say that it is a short and badly finished game in several aspects, for example: camera, movement and combat, it is still a great project. For those who do not know, this game is a university academic work, so we are talking about a team that is still in formation and that probably had no professional experience, but, even so, with the due knowledge, will and support of the training tools. development created this game that could really be very good with due refinement and completion. I believe that from the current state to the possible finished product, half the way has already been covered. The reason for wanting to talk about this game is just to highlight how our industry has grown, not only because of Hardware, but in the support of specialized tools, because in the past, even if you had the desire in the past, you would not be able to create a game in the high sizes or industry average, but not today, the proof is there. So if you really dream of game development, go ahead, as the path may be difficult, but you will succeed. ",True,False

"Don't laugh, the actual experience of the game is really like this. At first, the cute loli image of the protagonist Little Witch made you think that this is the Little Witch Fairy, but then you discover that it is actually a TPS (laugh). Although this game can indeed be regarded as a soul-like game, everyone is happy to call it ""the cute version of the black soul"", but in fact the difficulty of the game is quite approachable, and the difficulty curve is increased reasonably. Even if you are a hard worker in this type of game, you can believe it can be light. It's easy to get started, and it's not so easy to lose its challenge. The role system of the game is relatively simplified and not complicated, but the four types of combat magic possessed by the protagonist are all targeted (as mentioned at the beginning of the article, the magic in this game feels like shooting, just four types of magic correspond to four different firearms) , After chanting, they will produce their own unique additional effects. These buffs are even related to the decryption of some processes; the wind magic and the magic absorption array respectively correspond to the double jump and the ""reverse"" action, especially the latter. I believe everyone Friends who are familiar with the black soul understand its importance in the game; in terms of enemies, the three bosses currently appearing in the level have their own characteristics, similar to the battle in the black soul. Players need to observe and master the BOSS attack mode and implement corresponding countermeasures. , As long as the method is correct, the battle will become very easy. In short, judging from the current levels of the game, the game feels just right to play. The system is clear and simple but remains a bit challenging. The overall gameplay experience is quite comfortable. In addition, the game is also very interesting in some small details: for example, the little witch will fall to the ground cutely if she is exhausted in running or dodge state; the goddess statue corresponds to the campfire in the black soul, and the ""burning fire"" action is in this The work has also become a ""maiden's prayer""; and because the little witch is short, she will jump up and grab the lever to press down the switch by her weight when facing some relatively tall institutions. This little detail is so cute. . In the first half of this year, when the performance of domestic indie games was generally weak, a ""Little Witch Nobetta"" was born. In just one week, thousands of reviews were smashed and received rave reviews, and this praise was not only due to Chinese people’s comments on domestic products. For the support of the work, nearly two-thirds of the praise comes from overseas players. It is another miracle that the game can be sold so big even when the game is weak, but if it is not for the unique charm of the work, it may be difficult to achieve such a good result. The production team Ximeng Creative said frankly that in the past few years, the development income was almost nothing, and now it is difficult to sustain the development of funds, and now it is difficult to sustain the development of the game. In order to meet the expectations of the production team, this is also the best encouragement for them. I hope that the production team will continue to work hard, fulfill the promise to the players, maintain the current quality to complete the development of the rest of the game, and respond to everyone's enthusiastic expectations.

"One of the games with the most cyberpunk elements at present, with humorous character dialogues to guide you to understand the background setting of the game world, and the character creation is unique!

Taking each column as a wave, waves 1-10 and 16-79 can be directly on the screen. The safe point in the lower right corner hangs up. For the rest of the time, it is recommended to manipulate the protagonist to stay on the leftmost side of the screen, press the attack button and do not release, and keep the midfield. Most of the time, you don't need a large displacement, just move in a small area to avoid the barrage. In the end, the barrage's hit determination is relatively loose, and only the magic wand that the protagonist little fairy rides is the scope of the determination, and the little fairy's body is not counted as being injured if it is hit. But this is still pretty hard-core. I have played for more than 2 hours to pass the level anyway. Good luck to the friends who are all accomplished! ",True,False

"Reviewers, reviewers, reviewers. How many people like to consider themselves reviewers, but talk complete nonsense about the subject of their review. Here are a few examples: The plot of the game is standard for its theme, but still very little. Pretty damn little! There are 30 story missions in total and 4 police cases, each of which consists of several missions. All characters in the game are stereotyped, they could be revealed better. However, I liked the presence of scenes where the main character sees nightmares after the next story mission. Thus, the developers show us that undercover work is not easy. The developers decided to compensate for the short plot with additional tasks. In itself, having such tasks is good. The only bad thing is that most of them are quite boring, plus they are repeated (help the cops shoot the bandits, catch up the thief, help the cops shoot the bandits again, etc., etc.). Of the additional activities, I will single out races. They are really nice, enjoyable and reminiscent of NFS races. The physics of cars is implemented here better than it was done in GTA: SA. The sensations of driving a truck, car, motorcycle or boat are different from each other. The songs on the radio in cars are excellent, you probably already know some of them, and you may bring others into your player. What is it worth riding at maximum speed on a bike with Trivium or Killswitch Engage. During my passage of the game, I encountered the following bugs: - / I got rid of the cops on my tail, but the sound from their flashing lights did not disappear anywhere. Even loading another save does not help. But a complete restart of the game saves. This is a very annoying bug or new technologies are in service with the pharaohs. - / Once during a story mission, our main character just flew into the air when he tried to climb onto the roof of a building. Probably too much Red Bull, because it gives wings :) - / Sometimes an exploded car appeared on the road out of thin air and at a low altitude and fell down. - / Sometimes the Social Status menu freezes, where you can compare your statistics with the statistics of your friends, and after you throw it out of the game (and sometimes it just throws it out of the game). Achievements in the game are easy. 50 in the base game and 9 in the DLC. DLC stories are disgusting. The plot and side effects in them are sad.

"The game in general is quite well executed, but doesn't do much renewing the genre or anything. It builds on the foundations that have been laid out for Metroidvanias, so be prepared to mark areas that you can't yet proceed through to make it easier to know where to backtrack too. Personally I'd have liked the ability to have different coloured markers (as to indicate new skills needed or just treasures). For me this was quite annoying once, since I forgot to mark a certain gate, and it was the only point of progression, which meant I had to go throughout all the maps and check everything out (I feel like this is more on me than on the game though). Besides this the soundtracks are quite basic but nice to listen to anyway and won't annoy you into turning off the sound. The environments look really nice and fit well with the rest of the style of the game. The magic feels a bit basic (and honestly strong as in most of these games) but to be fair I haven't used much of it since I prefer combat over magic. The different types of weapons are quite nice, however since it's (somewhat) randomly generated you quite often find weapons weaker than the ones you already have. The only real performance problem I encountered was quite odd and I'm genuinely not sure if anyone else would ever encounter it. I'm using a Xbox Bluetooth Controller, which means it might sometimes (temporarily) lose connection, most of the time this is just for a second, however Chasm really doesn't seem to like this. Whenever my controller would lose connection the game would slow down to being pretty much unplayable, yet recover to normal speed when the connection was restored. In general this wasn't a problem (as you don't lose your connection that much) but since my controller was apparently low on batteries it had a real problem keeping up the connection (which took me a while to figure out what the problem was). In conclusion I'd recommend buying it, especially when on sale as I feel it's worth around 10$ easily. ",True,False

"Different from the traditional PAC-MAN, this time Namco has made a very refreshing ""racing"" game. After the game starts, the game speed will continue to rise. When the speed reaches the highest level 50, PAC-MAN will become difficult to control. At this time, how to keep the speed without dropping while continuing to eat beans and killing a large number of ghosts at one time becomes a take The key to high scores. In fact, even if the handicap is familiar with each maze, he can get a good score, but the manufacturer has not penalized any cheating behavior, so the top of the leaderboard is the ""god"" record that exceeds the game's maximum score. Points are very unfair to players of normal games. Finally, I look forward to the second generation that will be released soon to bring more interesting new gameplay. ",True,False

"This review is only about Dawn of war 2 singleplayer campaign. Gameplay is very straightfoward and fast. There are wide variety of abilities and units you can select to slay your foes. Different enemies requires different tools of the trade. There are so many mixes you can combine with available items and abilities that game keeps interesting for a good time. Although 10 000 slayed orcs later you feel like you have seen it all. Boss fights are disapointing as every boss just takes 1 000 times more dmg than average unit and launches some special blast at a pre-marked zone. Bosses gets repetive really fast. Main plot and characters are well written and fits perfect to wh40k's rich lore.  I like the idea that you simple don't have time to do every mission there are available. You have to excecute missions that suits your overall situation best. Also there are usually 2 strategic assets on the map and you can only conquer one of them. There are 3 kind of strategic assets in the game each benefit different kind of boost to you. Choose the ones suits you game style best. It would have been much better if you could just upgrade your weapons with points that you get by completing missions. Now you have to constantly check dmg/stats about weapons that drops during missions and you get like 10 new weapons in every mission. Useless weapons (about 90% of all drops) you just destroy to get small amount of experience points. All this dazzling doesn't bring anything good to the game and this mechanic should have been simplyfied. CGI cutscenes looks outdated and they should have done them with live action like in wh40k: Final liberation (1997). World of warhammer 40k is still well represented in cutscenes and especially in the opening cinematic. Endless slaughter what this game offers goes really repetitive after you have seen all the type of enemies and weapons there is to see. This game is without a doubt recomended if you are a warhammer fan, as you get so much more out of this game if you know the basic settings in warhammer 40k universe. The game kind of assume you are familiar with the lore and goes straight to the ""Bom bom bom"" -part. 10 - Perfect game 9 - Excelent game, best of the genre 7 - Average game, nothing really special 6 - Bad game, avoid 5 - Painful to play, completely waste of time 4 - Failed game, unpayable ",True,False

"Do you like reading? As in, do you like any sort of literature? This game, or rather, the story in this game, is 100% a must for you to read and experience. World building at its finest, characters steadily develop and welcome you more and more into the world in Pyre. Won't say anything else about the story, because I'd like everyone to go into this as blind as I did, so let me just deal a final card about it: I have played and read a gazilion of stories in my steam and not steam library, and this one, will not be forgotten. Aesthetic and sound... it's a ""Supergiant"" game, it's common knowledge by now that their work is amazing in those departments. I like the vibrant colours in this one, and the music sets the mood perfectly, chill, with feeling, nothing wrong here, as per usual. Gameplay, it's a 3v3 football (soccer for the US peeps) with RPG elements, depending on your choice of team, you may fare really well, or just be confronted by an outright superior team. It depends on skill mostly, the AI is competent enough, and I'd recommend playing on the harder difficulties, so it provides a better challenge. The only fault I find with Pyre, is the lack of online multiplayer. Not being able to play with my online friends, knowing how fun it is to play with my ""local"" friends, makes it a frustrating missing aspect. Overall, story is excelent, gameplay is really fun, especially on harder difficulties, I highly reccomend this game with sale or no sale, although at this point, might as well wait for the discount to show up. Do you like to read? well, reader, this one's for you. You don't like to read ? Not my place to judge, but do give this one a try, it might surprise you after a while. ",True,False
"There is no person I know that would not know of this game. Many gamers that I know regret every moment that they dont have this game. Its absoloutely brilliant, the requirements of the game are ridiculously low, the point of the game and gameplay is easy to understand for anyone who doesnt know of the game. However, this is a game that you would get bored of in about 2 hours of straight gameplay. Its impossible to stream it for more than 4h, because the game is so simple. All you do is walk and shoot. But indeed this is a trully great peace to play with your friends, you cannot play this game with more than 3 friends, so that sucks, but if there would be more players at the time it would be really boring and most of players would have nothing to do. Most of the rounds go fast forward and you do not get stuck at one point or another. The game has a minimum ammount of bugs or glitches, if there are any. There are multiple gamemodes and maps for you not to get bored within a day. But even knowing all the minuses, I still dont regret paying for this game. ",True,False
"Almost everything I wrote in the Spellforce 3 review regarding the technical part applies to this game as well. With some amendments. The graphics have become noticeably more beautiful, although it would seem that it is much better, they increased the interface and changed the spell panel, added new portraits for the main character. There have been many dialogues between the party members, this is good news. There are even dialogues with mercenaries, which I have never seen before. I got used to silent dummies.) We got rid of the stupid caravans that shamelessly robbed randomly appearing homeless people and now, when an outpost is captured, all resources in the region are immediately shown. The situation with the troops is the same sad, the obscure pile is small. So, what did it cost the plot units marked with soldiers to add these same portraits of soldiers from the barracks? Again the same rake with the complete absence of portraits. One of the main villains did not even deserve a portrait. What's wrong with the developers.) They are sawing a new game, but they cannot release a small patch to fix TWO NON-WORKING ACHIVES. My thoughts on the plot. As a whole, the plot is noticeably weaker than the previous part, apparently hitting his head in attempts to correct the technical part, they completely scored on the script. There is a large spoiler ahead. I recommend it to those who are impressed by Spellforce 3. Run in strict order, the plot is strongly related to each other. ",True,False

"★ — 9/10 Takes a while to get started but the end is worth it. After going into Death Stranding completely blind having avoided every published content about it from the day it was released on the PS4 and not knowing what exactly I was getting myself into, I can only say that if you have absolutely no interest in a story-driven game, don't want to pay attention to what's going on, and watch all the cutscenes as well as listen to all the dialogue then I'm not sure if this game is for you.  In my opinion, the story is amazing but requires focus as well as patience because it takes a while before things get rolling, unfold, and take shape. This isn't a game that will spell out the entirety of the plot for you right away, it takes some effort and most of all patience to get there, and personally, I've enjoyed the ride and the end was definitely worth it. I know there are quite a number of people who seem to like to label Death Stranding as a ""walking simulator"" but I firmly believe that those people have either never played the game themselves, don't understand what the game really is about and what it has to offer, or the type of game it is is simply just not for them. Is there a lot of walking around in the game? Yes, there is. Is that what the entire game is about? No, it's not, far from it actually. Personally, I'm someone who genuinely dislikes fetching quests but for some reason, in Death Stranding, I never once felt bored, annoyed, or frustrated while taking trips back and forth between locations in order to fulfill deliveries and quest-related things to continue my journey through the story. It's also not just simply running from point A to B and back because the game throws various things your way that you have to adjust to. You have weight to manage, check what type of equipment you may need, plan a route to take, figure out the dangers you may run into, whether to go by foot or take a vehicle, and plenty of other factors to take into account for the best possible outcome and your trip to go as smooth as possible. Another reason why labeling Death Stranding as a ""walking simulator"" is beyond me is that walking simulators focus on environmental storytelling and exploration without an actual threat or enemies. There are plenty of threats in this game. From MULEs, human NPCs who want to steal your cargo, to areas filled with creatures called BTs which is short for beached things, to actual boss fights. Of course, when you start out, your main focus is on being stealthy because you don't get the means to fight back right away which could also be something that puts people off because it takes quite a while for things to unlock but I think this is a much better solution in this type of game than immediately throwing every possible equipment one could ask for at the player right from the start. You need to work and put in some effort to get something in return which, in my opinion, definitely isn't a bad thing at all. Gaining people's trust, not letting them down, and working towards a common goal is what unlocks possibilities and gets you closer and closer to the end of your journey. Visually and auditory, Death Stranding is absolutely stunning. The cutscenes are great and add a lot to the delivery of the story. The voice acting is really well done and the soundtrack is absolutely beautiful and pleasant to listen to. 50+ hours into the game and I'm still not tired of it. I haven't played a game in quite a while that kept my interest for this long, especially after already having finished the main story, I hardly ever go back into a game after I'm done with the main story. To me, Death Stranding looks amazing, sounds amazing, plays amazing, has amazing characters as well as an amazing story and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who really likes story-driven action games and has the patience to push past a slow start.

"To begin with, I am a huge fan of Borderlands. I loved the first, spent over 500 hours on the second. What about Pre Sequel? Meh .. At the beginning I believed in the bitch, I saw in Pre Sequel just a big DLC ​​of Borderlands 2 with new characters ... The hours of games go by and I have come to certain conclusions. (SPOILER WARNING) /! \ Before reading all this I advise you to watch the trailers above on this page, you will better understand what I mean for those who have never touched any of the Borderlands. The positive points: -New characters, therefore, with new gameplay, new skill trees, customizations, etc. -The gameplay is divided into two phases. In an oxygen-free environment allowing immense jumps but which gradually consume your oxygen and in an environment with oxygen where the jumps are reduced but where the fire element weapons acquire their full potential. -Lots of easter eggs like in Borderlands 2. A reference to Star Wars, Pink Floyd, Mario, Daft Punk etc .. -New vehicles, new maps to explore, new enemies to destroy, new bosses to exterminate. -Borderlands The Pre Sequel is HARD. When I compare to the two previous opus, I find it more complex yes, the enemies resist well, do more damage which generates fights which are technical and of which more interesting. -little DLC. Again, compared to Borderlands 1 and 2, Pre Sequel features little DLC. I also recall that Borderlands 2 has 10 add ons without counting the skins. -A JETPACK. And we can play Claptrap..wow what more can we say. -Grotesque punchlines, cult lines and lots of humor with Borderlands sauce as we like. -A new weapon category, lasers and a new element, ice replacing slag. -A rather nice story located between Borderlands first of the name and Borderlands 2. We learn about Jack's past and the reason for his viceral hatred against bandits and ark hunters. The negative points: -The interface, the presentation, the graphics, even some legendary weapons of the previous games are THE SAME as in Borderlands 2. I find it a shame that a game released 2 years later is also predecessor. new content .. that's why this game reminds me of a huge DLC. -Many legendary weapons can only be obtained with the Crusher, a recycling-type crafting system that is easy to use but quite random. Okay, we'll have to farm the same mob 60 times more to get the long-awaited weapon, but ... at least this practice was making us hype. Moreover, few bosses or mobs that loot the legendary are farmable. Pity. -The difficulty as mentioned above can be an advantage for some but also a disadvantage for others. Dying 17 times against the same monster is quite frustrating indeed. It's up to you. -Few categories of monsters. The fauna of Elpis is much less impressive than that of Pandora. -A short lifespan. Indeed, the game is not very long and can be finished in 2 days by ordinary players. -Bugs in textures, enemies that cross the ground etc but nothing too serious seriously affecting the gameplay. I must have forgotten some details. In conclusion I will simply say that this game is good without being incredible. However, I would have liked to see more innovations from the developers in 2 years. Cartoon-style graphics still have their charm. PC level, Borderlands The Pre Sequel is a little bigger than Borderlands 2 without requiring a monstrous configuration. Finally I advise you to wait for the sales to buy it. Yes it's a good game BUT in my opinion it's not really worth the price. All of this is obviously my opinion and it was very hard to remain as neutral as possible as I love the universe of Borderlands. See you soon in game ... or for the release of Borderlands 3! * hype over 9000 * ",True,False
"""You're fighting a war that no one else is paying attention to."" // Reviewer played the game for over 70% of the main story at the time of Story ___________________________. For this part of the story takes place in Sanf. Francisco It will continue the story through the protagonist named Marcus. Holloway Young Hacker, owned by 'Retro' of the Deadsec Group, with the plan to overthrow Blume, a large American electronic media company. Carrying out the story in this sector reduces the serious tension from the original episode and adds humor and hilarity. The must-see in this installment is the main character. In addition to Marcus, there is also a group of his friends who have memorable personalities and make the game much more engaging with this group. If asked if the story in this sector is good or not, for us we must say no, but it is addictive due to the humor and the narrative within the game that makes the player enjoy it. And an additional mission that has bite in the social era that is so close to us that we can make small lollipops But the disadvantage we see right now is the main villain of the game that we feel a bit lacking in charm, in that his appearance is largely unrecognizable from the times he played in Gameplay ___________________________ game. The gameplay in this sector is considered to be well made and developed from the early part. With a variety of gameplay opportunities that allow you to play by utilizing the newly added system or using drones to reach the destination. Our favorite spot is the branding system that allows us to shoot various sights in San Francisco, which will increase the XP or the number of followers and unlock new selfies. Used as something that makes the game quite enjoyable. And the game in some places, both in the story and looking for items to unlock skills, there is a little Puzzle to connect the pipe for us to do, but it is worth it sometimes. It is a bit annoying with the location and the physics of the car that hit a little, crash or crank, and Graphic ___________________________ As always we would say that reviews of graphics in But as you can see right now, the images in that game are well made. (Not sure if it was downgraded or not because I did not follow this game at launch) and we still have not encountered any bug problem or problem eating up the machine's resources. One to more than 20, but that is only one time Overall ____________________________ + story that made it fun and funny. + The main characters of a memorable DeadSec group, including the protagonist. + More and more immigration system (This one blessed himself because I like it) + subordinate mission that some of them bite the social era + Gameplay developed from the beginning - The story, if the fun is cut off, it is rather passive. - A villain who is somewhat lacking in charm, although he has an attractive personality. - What to criticize? 8/10 ""People don't care about how they care about the outcome.""

"At one time, the second part came to me strongly. What was required of the developers? Take the idea of ​​the previous game, put events from hot Arizona in dank Colorado and add an interesting story. It would seem that what could have gone wrong. However, it went ... Improved in the game, except perhaps the graphics, and these changes still need to look, but the music. In terms of music, there are no complaints at all - the final country-style songs, praising our exploits or unknown death, went especially well. Everything else - the gameplay, the plot and its presentation ... quiet horror: - The armor and the amount of life in the game are just numbers, and absolutely meaningless. A melee fighter with a wild number of hit points and in the best armor for 80 hit points in almost every battle is taken out with one shot. And not from a sniper rifle, no! An ordinary gun or even a pistol. And vice versa - a sniffed opponent with an armor level of 12 units can be picked out with the whole composition a couple of moves, using pistols, shotguns, katanas and the like. Pomegranates of all varieties are even less useful. - Lack of ammunition and medicines. Where is it all? At a high difficulty level, I ran out of ammo exactly once for a sniper rifle in the prologue. After getting to the first store, the stock was replenished and there were no more problems. And with first aid kits of all formats it would be possible to lay out the huge word ""ENOUGH"" - Talking Heads on the entire map of Colorado. Why the hell did the developers add them to the game? No, well, let's say the idea is good, even in the first two Fallouts it was similar. But since during the development process it turned out that you are not exporting - maybe it was worth getting rid of this idea altogether? Why is the interlocutor's head shown only at the first meeting, and then we communicate as with the rest of the servants? Why, out of three children of the Patriarch, only two have speaking heads? Was the younger one not so important to the plot? - Companions that must be taken from the NPC for the full roster. Why the hell were they added? Senseless, they entered the conversation five times, and all the time they were dissatisfied with something. Some quest, moreover, is registered only for one ... - The plot is just something. Predictable as a forester's boots. No unexpected turns for you ... but what, and ""expected"" turns, too. Straight as a sleeper.

"Mordhau, A game of extreme aggravation and torment. When it comes to sword play games there is nothing better than this game especially in the medieval genre, wonderful customization and creativity, beautiful graphics, and awesome sound design. But it's player base and mechanics can get a bit heavy, players come and go with their toxicity but when it's there, man is it there. Followed by it's very heavy control scheme taking about half your keyboard and very awkward timing of swings and opponent reading, this game is the king of hard to learn, AND hard to master all at once. Vets coming from chivalry make this game a big up hill battle to climb when it comes to catching up, so do not expect this game to be a pick up and play kind of game, time and time again you will have your ass handed to on a silver platter until you get some form of understanding on how to defend yourself, but it's up to you when you learn it, sadly in this game you can't have everything taught to you in one night, you have to learn by playing countless of hours just to get somewhat efficient at dueling, and never mind fighting crowds of people. The learning curve is so deep you are gonna be scratching your head on what you did wrong half the time because it is not completely obvious of your mistakes, you are just gonna have to guess until you find the right one, which can take a day, or a year. Every attack is pretty much bindable but you may not have enough fingers or mental capacity to do all 6 directional swings and stabs, so I recommend using the 240 feature to do the swap work but it can be a bit unreliable at times, which is why I suggest using the 3rd person view for more spatial awareness as the swings depend on mouse movement which can make you disoriented in 1st person. The hitbox is super accurate and I mean crazy accurate, so it does not take much to miss an attack. (ping can play apart tho) All an all the game is very fun and a nice pass time, but the very hard mechanics and experienced players may ruin the enjoyment of the climb making you want to quit early, But unless you enjoy a challenge and want to over come this mountain go ahead and give it a shot. 7/10 and maybe even an 8 if the parry system was not so annoying and counted for everything on survival, I miss games using block as a form a defense and not just a stupid parry system, I can't stand games that do that. But if you are more of a casual gamer then I suggest you stay away from this and go buy something more chill, because there is nothing sweatier than Mordhau. ",False,False

I'm aloud to post a review, its my right. At the pace these devs are at right now, and with the small team they have; I don't expect much for maybe another year. Also if this was only for the backers, how did it get out to the public, it's their own fault and they have nobody but themselves to blame. It's going to be a long road for this game and maybe possibly in the future the game will change my perspective on how I feel about the game.

"Forget about everything that Uncle Sam taught you in the last part, almost all of these chips were cut out of the game. There is no more noise level here, run behind your opponents - no one will hear. There is no adequate stealth in the shade, there are only 2 levels: dark and light. In the dark you cannot be seen, but in the light the opponents suspect something. BUT, this does not work in the headquarters, they see you in the dark and sometimes through the walls, they hear you even when you sneak. By the way, the doors in the headquarters do not close by themselves, unlike other missions, and therefore opponents pay attention to this. The facial expressions of the enemies deserve mention, although the faces are realistic, but when they talk, they move as if they are dolls and control their mouth with a hand. There are so many bugs here that I spent almost half of my playing time on them. Do you want to complete the game without killing? Prepare for the bodies that you hide to disappear on their own and die. Constant crashes when loading the game from the menu and launching missions. You try to load the game via the ""Continue"" button - the game crashes. You try to load the game through the save list - the game crashes and removes the save that you tried to load from the list. It would seem that if you try, then the game can be played in 2-3 passes, bypassing these hellish downloads. But that was not the case, the game crashes with any wrong movement. Some crashes are tied to specific actions, and some are random. It will be lucky if the game just closes, and does not freeze and will not give an opportunity to shut it down forcibly, in such situations you have to shaman. Unfortunately, I found out too late that the game has 2 versions from different studios, one is good, and the second went to us. The PS2 version has all those features that for some reason didn't get here, plus a normal plot without holes. In both versions, the essence of the plot is the same, but in the version for PS2 we are shown more details and served it normally, and not as it is done here.

"As of now this game lacks fundamental settings for a real experience. I do NOT recommend trying it out yet. for starters there's no vsync option, just a frame-rate limiter option. secondly and largely:  Graphic Presets :( really? are you serious? the amount of LOD flicking is absolutely insane and VERY immersion breaking. Every single rock within 15m will change LOD and it's super distracting. which leads me back to the start of my second point; LET ME DECIDE THE GRAPHIC OPTIONS FOR MY SYSTEM. My 1080ti is idling away playing this, where if you would simply allow me to turn up LOD/Render distance I would have had a much better experience. Also I have no idea on gods earth why you would put in a render resolution slider only to limit it to 1.0. Seems like the devs have never played a pc video game before.

"📝 You slip into the role of a young warrior who sets out with friends to get three powerful, magical stones to stop an evil necromancer who wants to subjugate the world. So it is a typical fantasy setting, which is not wrong at first. Unfortunately, the story is told in an incredibly boring way. The cutscenes are much more about presenting the new units or having inconsequential conversations than about driving the plot forward. The characters remain extremely superficial and interchangeable, the same applies to the villain. 🎮 As the title suggests, it is a tower defense game. This offers 25 missions in which you have to defend up to 5 lines. However, there is no final backup, such as in or, which both work similarly. This means that if even one opponent gets through, it's game over. To prevent this, over 20 units, consisting of the troops that can be placed and their improvements, are available. On the other hand, there are roughly the same number of opponents, although most of them also have an improved version so that you can roughly halve the number of really different figures on both sides. In addition to an attack value and the cost, each unit also has life points, because your units can be destroyed by the enemies. This makes blockers more important. However, you cannot take all units and improvements with you, but only a limited selection. To do this, it is important to see what the enemy is letting go of you before the start of the fight and to adapt your own troops to it. To get units on the field at all, you first have to get money. For this you have to place treasure chests. These give you gold at regular intervals. You generate resources over time, but far too little to defend yourself effectively. If things go bad, you can use magic to help your troops. These 3 spells are automatically received during the campaign. You can only finish the game in the missions. This means you always have to do the cutscene before the mission if you want to finish. Since these are sometimes very long and above all cannot be skipped, this is very annoying. In addition, the game was smeared twice, in both cases when the last opponent had given up the spoon, so I had to fight the whole fight again, oh yes and of course the cutscene had to go through again. The boss appears as if he was in the second row, but in fact he is in the third. As a result, I strengthened all the units in row 2 and then wondered why they weren't attacking the boss, thanks for that ... The ice mages briefly stun enemies so that they neither move nor attack. However, if they release themselves from this rigidity, they glide through barrels or other blocking units when they stand in front of them. There are no other game modes besides the campaign, not even minigames, which makes the game extremely short. 🎥 The game tries to have realistic graphics, at least in terms of the environment and the opponent's design. The group of heroes, as well as their own units, are kept in one look. This seems a bit strange, but you get used to it. What you get less used to are the animations of the characters in the cutscenes, which are played in a boring loop. There are a few exceptions in which the figures really do come into action, but these sequences can be counted on one hand. 🎶 The setting is quite ok. There are different titles that adapt to the scenes in the cutscenes and in the battles there is mostly pleasant background music. However, the characters are not set to music, so you have to rely on the subtitles. Unfortunately, this always runs at the same speed, which means that short texts can be read several times, while you can skim a long time. ☠︎ Honestly? So much mediocrity and a lot of crap for an impressive 15 €? Oh and that with a playing time of less than 4 hours? No thanks! The game was made available to the GGC for review purposes. ",False,False

My reason for buying the game and returning it back is that you cannot fight for 60 people on eu servers since the day the game was released, because there are no players. In a similar game, f2p came out and sold a mercenary hero, now he plays it with bots, there are many reasons why the games are stillborn. In such games, cosmetics should be sold instead of selling heroes and games, otherwise it becomes a game that we play with bots due to the shortage of players. The PVP system should definitely be improved, there are 4 counteractive mechanics including guard, parry, dodge and combobreak, but you don't need to use anything other than guard and combo break because once you get caught or caught, you can win with a few skills by left clicking and the extremely flat and boring choice is yours.

"I really love the last numbered parts of Far Cry: these are bright and funny shooters in a live sandbox, where some kind of game is constantly going on. Ubisoft, apparently, decided that it turns out too well and it is necessary to pour in the ointment. As a result, New Dawn happened - not a game, but a real conceptual obscenity. In principle, the gameplay has two main drawbacks, but they go hand in hand: the need to grind resources for pumping weapons, combined with a small amount of content. The world map was reduced by half compared to Far Cry 5, without significantly changing the density of events. The developers tried to compensate for this with the ability to reset the progress of capturing outposts and a new expedition mode. These very expeditions are relatively small maps with different entry and exit points, where you need to steal a package with resources from enemies, and then hold out for a couple of minutes under fire until evacuation. It doesn't sound so bad, but there are only three such sorties in the game. So get ready to clean up the same maps and outposts at once to grind resources. What will happen to a player who doesn't want to farm gasoline and hardware to create a third level Kalash? Well, most likely it will suck even on ordinary forest moose or wolverines, not to mention bulletproof elite soldiers. If you don't want to please every second NPC, then the publisher has prudently introduced the possibility of buying currency to pump everything in the game. Every resource, skill point, weapon ... in total! You can pay on the go for the coolest fluff in the game and bend over. Think about it: Ubisoft is building a single player pay-to-play game around character progression and pumping it up with micropayments like a mobile jerk. Natural Pay to Win. In my opinion, this is almost the worst that the modern premium gaming industry is capable of. Speaking as devil's advocate, I want to note that the progression in New Dawn is more or less smooth and tries not to force events once again. However, this does not protect the player from the unfortunate moments of the third Witcher's level, when the developers put some high-level beast almost at the beginning of the game, which interferes with closing the point of interest on the map. The character reaches its maximum development in ten hours, which is even fast by modern standards, but, as mentioned earlier, get ready to farm resources by mastering the same content. I am doubly offended for the spoiled gaming experience, because behind the creepy monetization and stupid progression lies that very funny Far Cry with an interesting sandbox. Towards the end of the game, New Dawn generally introduces superpowers for the main character, such as invisibility or double jump. Jumping enemies on the heads with a flamethrower is pretty cool, I want to note, especially when your character is wearing knightly armor. It turns out such an amusing adaptation of the post-nuclear crusades. If you want to take a chance and play New Dawn for the sake of other means of expression, then it's better not to bother with the plot. It is functional enough, but not annoying, and beautiful videos are, in principle, interesting to follow. I would say that the story and presentation are at the level of Far Cry 5. What really worked out was the picture and the music. The soundtrack is very pleasant, and you can admire the local views. In the photo mode, I generally settled for a couple of hours. Nevertheless, behind a beautiful game in a blooming post-apocalypse, there is an evil simulator of Stockholm syndrome and psychological pressure on the player. Now imagine in the future games from Ubisoft, flavored with the same bastard monetization system, but with a price tag of 80 euros. The beauty! ",False,False
"This game can't be that bad, by God ... These are the points why I do not recommend this game - This game is full of bugs to no more power.

The developers did not even bother to put more than 12 levels, as they are going to sell a game if it only brings 12 levels, it shows that they only created this game just to create it and generate profits. How can you believe that in less than 30 minutes I finished the game without any complications. In summary, I do not recommend this game at all, it only serves to have it as an ornament in the library and more nothing, because it is useless to play.

"A small visual novel (about an hour of reading) with elements of a ""quest"", which tells about a group of friends who decided to spend a weekend in a remote hotel in the middle of nature and faced terrible ""accidents"". The story is structured in such a way that the reader is given the opportunity to learn the plot from any of the company and make the story ""unique"" for everyone. There is no point in dividing the game into endings. they either repeat themselves, or only the character changes, the situation itself and the ending remain the same. To be specific, let's move on to the opinion. Sick fantasy of the developer. I think this phrase alone could describe the whole meaning of the novel, but you can't just take and call someone unreasonably, so let's find out in more detail. The plot is based on the narration of the same story from different angles with changes that depend on the player. This was supposed to become the main feature of the novel, but it became the main flaw - many actions and dialogues, regardless of the character chosen, were repeated, almost everyone thought, did and said the same thing, and where the player wanted and could change the course of events, they prohibited it to do and give only empty dialogue. In cases where there are still changes, the story begins to leave the main narrative and by his action, the player changed not only the reality of the controlled character, but also the reality of another who did not contact him and in fact, regardless of the chosen character, must lead yourself the same in the same situation. Yes, I understand that it sounds confusing, so I'll put it simply - the narration from the faces of different characters is done as crookedly as possible. As for the meaning of the story, it’s simply unbearable to read. Characters behave either inadequately (for the sake of a variety of gameplay for different heroes), or as banal and primitive as possible: ""Hey-s-s, what can you do in such a wilderness? Overpower the girls, he-s-s."" This is the whole plot: 50% nonsense and 50% erotic. Moreover, the further the story goes, the more delirium and eroticism becomes. Some heroes simply die, and at the end of the game, the survivors meet with ""Death"", who thanks for the help and apologizes for killing the friends of the survivors, justifying it by saying that he can do nothing but kill. But, then ""Death"" recalls that the second half of the plot is lust and offers the surviving heroes a three, two or lesbian sex, depending on who survived. Do you think I'm kidding? No, everything is so, you can evaluate this p *** t yourself, if you do not feel sorry for your psyche. And of course, how can a story be without fateful choices on which the course of the story depends. And of course they are in this novel. However, the most important of them remained in the erotic scenes cut from the game, which can be returned by installing the desired patch. After all, it is so important during a sex scene to make a choice where to ""finish"": on the chest, on the stomach or on ""* isu"". And this is not even ""ridiculous"", this is a real citation of the elections. Yes, I understand that, ironically, I am writing this review on April 1 (I will publish the second on purpose), but it was far from funny to me, but very krinzhovo. And to a great, but expected regret, the krinzh was not only in the plot, but also in technical details. Let's move on to them. Visually, for a free novel, things don't look so bad. Aside from the gnarled characters and the wry-eyed erotica, the backgrounds and a few CG artwork were decently drawn. The game even has primitive eye animations and a few background moments such as rain. And if you don't look at the picture (or have a vision of -4), then you might think that everything is fine. Music and soundtrack, these are good old compositions from the free music library. What do you want? Author's sound? In a free novel of this quality? By the way, the music was chosen badly, it does not hold either the atmosphere or the quality. But on the other hand, you can name a whole bunch of details: 1) never obtrusive advertising of the developer's website in the main menu (I understand that everyone wants to eat and be popular, but this is already some kind of impudence), 2) not translated main menu (if available official Russian language), 3) a bunch of untranslated phrases in the plot of the novel, 4) a jamb with names (Alice is sometimes listed as ""Liza"", and Pasha as ""Paul"") 5) spelling errors in the text, 6) braking when clicking on objects , 7) puzzles on the level ""move the puzzle pieces to get the correct picture"" and that's it. I think many, and without summing up, realized that this game, although it is free (strange, I would also sell it for money), but at its core, it is the schizophrenia of a developer suffering from anxiety about ""pussies and boobs"". There is simply no value in terms of plot or technical aspects. You can read this only as an introduction to the inner world of a sick person. In all other cases, I recommend that you refrain from reading this and leave an appropriate, negative assessment. ",False,False

"I don't understand how this game has a ""Very Positive"" review score despite having game-breaking bugs and crashes. If this is an example of a very positive game, Pillars of Eternity 1 and 2 must be a masterpiece. It's obvious that most of the positive reviews are from Larian fanboys and not fans of Baldur's Gate games. If you watch a youtube video critiquing this game, you'll see massive dislikes from the same people. I gave this game a chance even though I did not like how Larian just ignored all the fans of the first two Baldur's Gate games and how this game mechanics are just copied and pasted from the Divinity games.  For those people who say that the turn-based combat and the game as a whole resembles DnD tabletop more than the first Baldur's Gate games, you're right but this is a pc game series that came out two decades ago. Baldur's Gate 3 should be more similar to the first two Baldur's Gate games as this is an established series at this point.  Aside from the repetitive complaints from Baldur's Gate fans like myself, I still won't recommend this game just yet because the number of bugs in a single 3-4 hour session will make you want to kill yourself. There are textures that never load, crashes, black screens which forces you to restart the game, etc. The story itself is alright so far but nothing spectacular. I find myself going through the motions to get to the end rather than wanting to know more about this world. If this was a game by Ubisoft, Electronic Arts, or Blizzard, people would be all over this game trashing this game to hell, but since it's made by Larian, fanboys give all kinds of excuses and defend this game from anyone and everyone, especially Baldur's Gate fans. You probably already have this game if you like Larian. I just wanted to throw my two cents in the reviews section. ",False,True

"Game based on the TV series ""Barygi"". I cannot recommend the game, although I spent quite a lot of time in it. There is very little positive in the game, unfortunately, the pumping of the team at the beginning, the plot, with sidebars from the series. It is very surprising at the beginning how the order of the move was made here, each move we do one action, with one unit, then the same opponent and so on in turn. You can get used to it, but it plays strangely. The main disadvantages include the unfinished nature of the game, it was clearly abandoned along the way, all these experience points, money, the number of mercenaries were screwed up, but they did not decide what to do about it. Enemies here are hopelessly stupid, they can stand for several moves while we kill them or run up to our group at close range. Well, if they hit us, we run to the side and, wiping the sweat from our forehead, we are treated, such an animation here, it's funny (no). The plot is linear, we play first for DEA, then for a drug addict, the differences are minimal. Cards are also not pampered with variety and instantly become boring. In both companies, there are 9 main story missions, in order to proceed to their implementation, you need to complete 4 side missions. In general, everything is as always, the game is based on the movie = we blind on the knee fast, the main thing is the Name. p.s. Now the same publisher, but with a different developer, they are making a game with sharp peaks, it is hard to believe that it will turn out better. ",False,False

"In fact, I expected a lot more from Deadlight, even though there were a lot of negative reviews. But I should have listened to what people say ... in the end, I was not ready for a huge number of bugs and other jambs, which almost completely blocked many advantages, forcing me to rush from a ""negative"" assessment to a ""positive"" one and back. Okay, let's take a closer look at this highly controversial game. The first thing we will encounter is the plot and its presentation in the form of a stylishly drawn comic book, thanks to which everything that happens is perceived extremely positively, and it is at least interesting to follow this. The plot itself tells about the events in Seattle of the 1980s, where the zombie apocalypse took place. The main character, Randal Wayne, along with a group of other survivors, is trying to find his family, which he thinks has been taken to a safe area. Actually, this will be our main goal, towards which we will go during 3-4 hours of the game, which, unfortunately, is not enough, but more on that later. During these 3-4 hours, our eyes will be pleased with quite good graphics, which do not upset with detail, and the comic, almost noir style withstands, and our ears will delight with cool sound design and a good soundtrack, quietly sounding somewhere in the background, but making the atmosphere even more gloomy. A few words should also be said about the gameplay. Deadlight is an action platformer with puzzle elements in which you have to climb different ledges and stairs, sometimes interacting with elements of the environment, which, in fact, are the elements of the puzzle, and sometimes entering into combat clashes with walkers, from which you can come out the winner only if you competently spend the ammunition for the firearm and the stamina necessary for blows with a fire ax, otherwise you will simply be bitten. Some sections you will naturally have to run, because sometimes a crowd of zombies, a military helicopter, or a generally dilapidated building will simply start to collapse after you. But ... it is precisely in these areas that one of the main problems of the game lies. The biggest problem lies in the very areas where you need to run a lot. The bottom line is that most of these sections are built on the most wild timings, which, if you don't catch it with an accuracy of a millisecond, you're a dead body. For example, closer to the final in one of the buildings above us, the ceiling will begin to collapse, and you need to get to the exit as soon as possible. This moment pissed me off in the first place by the fact that there it is completely unclear at what moment you need to jump in order to get sufficient acceleration and not literally die of air. At first I thought that this was just some kind of bug that would not let me go further, but no, this is the most real awkwardness of the developers. Therefore, already in the third hour of the game, when I got tired of all these bugged segments of the levels, I began to ask myself the question ""well, will it all end soon?"" And surprisingly, it all ended really quickly, and so quickly that when I saw the final of the game, I simply could not understand what had happened, there was a natural mess in my head. And only later, when I put everything on the shelves, I realized that the plot here, in general, can only boast of an interesting presentation. If the timing was stretched for another two or three hours to reveal all the characters, their motivation, the plot would only benefit. But here's the bad luck: if the timing were stretched, then the perception of the gameplay would suffer from this, which by the end was already beginning to pall. Honestly, I do not want to give a negative assessment to Deadlight, but, in my opinion, it does not deserve a positive one either. The shortcomings listed above hit the general perception of the game very hard, which has almost everything you need to make you love it, but alas, it is equally happy and upsetting. Therefore, I can hardly recommend this game to buy, at least for the full price and if you are not ready to put up with the obvious problems of the game. ",False,False

"Sadly, this seems to be an attempt at a retro shooter made by people who watched gameplay videos of the classics, but didn't play them (or played them and somehow got the wrong idea?) The two main weapons I've used so far feel way too underpowered (shotgun has trouble dealing with Imps, for instance) and the enemies all look too similar. This is also an issue with the rest of the game's overall look as well, since it seems like they went with a Hell theme that's basically ""hey, Hell is red-ish"" Level design is also a snoozefest so far, while we are at it. The music is serviceable, and the voice actor is clearly doing his best, but I can't help but feel dumb when he proclaims his love for the Church of the Triple Barreled Shotgun, while at the same time never having enough ammo to fire it, and when he does, it's a water pistol. So far, the game is a complete disappointment, with the only thing I like being the movement speed. I hope it improves, but I'm not so sure about the chances of that happening.

"Much like the FIFA series has spent a majority of the last decade focusing on their Ultimate Team pay to win mode, PES development has left everything else than the myClub mode a relatively barren wasteland. It's been years since the traditional manager career mode Master League has seen substantial changes, and playing against the PES AI is not enjoyable to begin with. Gone are the days when different opponents had fairly unique playstyles; nowadays the only noteworthy differentiation regarding the AI is how extremely they cheat on the higher difficulty levels, with your own players becoming sluggish lemmings with slower and delayed animations in the name of a ""challenge"". As the myClub mode is available for free a couple months after each PES launch in the form of  , there's no compelling reason to pay even more (considering how much real money a bunch of viable players will cost you) just to play it a bit earlier. In 2019 the only thing one missed out by playing the Lite version are some particularly overpowered pay to win players that were only available in the months before the F2P launch (and, technically, a hilarious manager with four strikers). As for the online gameplay, it's most enjoyable playing against a friend of similar skill level on the same continent, given both are happy to lose matches to the other. The other modes are plagued by cheaters, gruesome cross-continental input delay, and absurd scripting/momentum (as seen in FIFA titles) that become very frustrating for any matches you do take seriously. Unfortunately Konami disabled the progression features that are core to myClub for matches against opponents of your choice. I understand that boosting is a concern otherwise, but in a game where a lot of the community grind out thousands of simulated matches (COM v COM) to slowly gain ingame currency, it's a rather absurd argument. On the positive side, because the game has a tiny playerbase, during off-peak hours it's very easy to get matchmade against a friend in ranked mode using moderate team strength. Coincidentally the game is also a lot more fun if one avoids using the best players — with weaker teams there is a bigger variety of valid tactics and players. Using two, three or four star teams is where the game is the most fun. It's still completely pay to win, and that matches against friends as well as coop matches lack progression features really brings it down. ",False,False

The functionality of the game is justified by the low price tag, and could be justified by early access, but the game is already in release, which inspires some concerns and does not give a positive assessment.

"Etherlords II feels like a game lost in what it's predecessor could have been, and what it wants to be.  It strives to give the same sense of battle as the previous game: turn based card battles in the same vein as Magic the Gathering.  However, it has taken all jeopardy out of those battles.  Normally, for me this would not be a bad thing, and indeed it is helpful, in that the game is formated much more like and RPG, like a story.  So each battle gives much needed XP and strategy information for further battles, and if one tactic doesn't work, another might. This would all work wonderfully, but for the fact that the story you gain is so scant, and the game primarily turns into a map crawl where you guess and pick and choose at which creatures are the best to pick this time.  If the game made the battles interesting, it would be one thing, but as a person who finds chess ultimately dull, this game made me horribly bored.  Plus there was no risk; you could just ""try again"" at any battle, having lost nothing, so the game turns into an exercise not really in strategy per se, so much as a guessing and recording game for each of the story lines, where you figure out what is effective through tedious trial and error, then reenact it on any higher level monster of the same type with the same types of creatures. The lack of investment this wrought, for me made the story boring, the battles tedious and the tactics canned.  With the sound and the graphics obviously salvaged from it's predecessor, this is barely two steps up the ladder from the first game, which was in all honesty more difficult and with a higher risk, but also much too punishing.  This sequel makes the opposite mistake, where there are no stakes, no worry, and the only thing this serves to do is waste the player's time trying to determine the best way to play, or to engender cheating using anything from guides to actual codes in an attempt to grasp the story.

"And finally, after playing no more, no less than 143 hours, I decided to review this game. In my review, I will neither praise the game, nor criticize it, since it has plenty of pros and cons. Well, let's start with the pros: + customization of the characters is commendable, the developers did their best, because each color of an object makes a character unique in its own way. + A very large open world, buildings with which you can get from location to location + The character's interaction with the outside world is well thought out. + An impressively large variation of weapons and equipment As for the disadvantages of this game: - Well, as always, Yubisoft with optimization and graphics ""at altitude"" is complete crap, on a 1080 video card it sags to 15 Fps. A huge number of bugs. - Monotonous gameplay. - The whole essence of the dark zone is according to one meticulous scheme - to collect gear and evacuate to a cache - Elite weapons have almost no weight, when you are 250 lvl you can easily have 231 lvl, in fact, this is influenced by certain configurations of equipment as a result of which there is a critical influence on damage done, vitality, as well as the quality of your skills. And in conclusion, I advise this game only to those people who are ready to shell out such an amount and not abandon the game for two days, and then regret the money spent (in general, the game is only for an amateur) ",False,False

To get these vast amounts of visuals processed on my humble GTX 980 Ti... never would have thought. Granted, I get the occasional 1-2minutes of freezes before some larger portion of the map gets loaded in, so there's a lot of optimization to be done. I also believe this should be prioritized before release more, not only in this game.  TL;DR: It's a beautiful masterpiece once you get it to run. But a lot of optimization still needs to be done and the FPS is mostly smooth, but quite unstable at times.

"the game is very interesting in terms of the Army and the workforce which finally adds a LOGIC in the fighting, it is a shame not to be able to better manage the disposition of its army (left flank, right flank ...). THE BIG NEGATIVE POINTS of the game: -There is no longer this atmosphere of managing and making your character prosper, now the person you play is quite simply useless ... you no longer manage ANY INTRIGUES, ANY ambition and when you have a child it doesn't change anything .... in the past you had to fight to keep your dynasty going and now there is NOTHING. -On the political level it's the same, there are only 2 BIG diplomatic possibilities: the alliance and creating a defensive league ... there is no way to create a coalition against a player who plays ROME and who owns half of Europe ... so the BOTS are slow and do not bring a fulfilling gameplay ... -The great powers such as Carthage are NON-EXISTING, Carthage will hardly move ... In less than 10 hours of gameplay , I played the Iceni and I own all of England ... A friend played Rome and he is unstoppable ... - ABSOLUTELY MUST make the bots more intelligent !!!! If you are a BIG power of 400 cities and you have lots of small countries with 10 cities each, you will tell me it makes sense that the bots should: either carry a good diplomatic relationship against the big country, or create a BIG coalition for put down the threat? HEY NO he doesn't care! But the game has an aggression system! The more you attacked, the more dangerous you are ... except that the aggressiveness you lose it VERY quickly, so you can re attacked galore ... and the BOT even if you have destroyed 50% of the planet, if your aggressiveness is at 0, he doesn't give a damn about you .... The diplomatic scope is poorly explained, but still makes sense in this world. The citizen system is coherent. But we absolutely have to put back the family system, character management and ADD more BUILDING! Because the possibility of building 4 buildings with a limit of 1 building maximum .... well it's a bit boring to buy a game at 55 euro with as little possibility ... My rating: -> Army: 17 / 20 -> Diplomatic: 12/20 -> Politics: 2/20 (Y EN A PAS !!!) -> Personal management: 0/20 -> Revolt: 8/20 (revolts are more strong than the other nations, their armies do not take into account the strength ... suddenly they can recruit at INFINITE). -> Technological: 16/20 very good idea -> Economical: 16/20 lack of difficulty ",False,False

The gameplay is exactly the same game, with the same problems. Weapons still don't feel right. New instances of the weather do not. Several new types of enemies have appeared, but they use old patterns of movement and attacks, which devalues ​​them. Lvl design is still primitive and boring. But there are at least a number of changes here: Large open spaces appeared. Despite the introduction of the sniper rifle into the game, this change was rather a negative game. From time to time there are situations when there are a lot of enemies, but they run to the player for a couple of minutes. In some places, elements of platforming were added. Location design is uneven. In the first half of the game, he looks (after Egypt) more recent, but in the second he becomes frankly weak. Rooms with changed rules have appeared (for example, rooms where the player staggers from side to side). They diversify the gameplay quite well, although not all are successful (hello, castle in the middle of an icy lake (goodbye, remnants of logic)). During the passage, the pace of the game is reset twice, by selecting the entire arsenal, and dropping opponents to the initial level. Why this was done is unclear, it really affects the dynamics. The technical performance is at the same level. As in the first part, it is worth playing only from strong bouts of nostalgia. Sam has nothing to offer a new player. ",False,False

"This is a failure. No, ""failure"" is not a word that can describe my feelings. It's just f * ck. The game was released 10 months after the release of the second part, and was planned as a DLC. As a result, it turned out to be a separate game, which took one half of the chips and threw it away, and simply screwed up the other. Okay, now I will try to clearly state my thoughts. Plot: Billy Lerk from the second part decided to find her teacher Daud (who does not know, this is the murderer of the empress from the first part) to atone for her guilt. After finding him, she gets the last and most important thing in her life - to kill the Alien. As you understand, without the first and second parts, you have nothing to do here. Characters: I won't be lying if I say that throughout the entire game I sympathized with one Alien, and made a choice at the end in his direction. How frightened should I help the assassins against whom I played the first part, and whom I despised in the second? The stranger helped me in the previous parts, was a companion of Corvo and Emily, sometimes even helped out, and now the game tells me: ""Dude, we know that this is a key character in the universe of these games, we know that you fell in love with him, and now go and kill him Why? Eeeem, well, oh-he caused a lot of troubles, here, there he made a cult around him, yes. "" Okay, if the game tried to show the positive sides of these killers, but no, the game only shows those sides that, in theory, cannot evoke positive emotions. And then why shouldn't I give a fuck when the main characters have problems? And they mocked the Alien too. Someone whom I considered to be someone extraterrestrial, powerful, was made a rag, who is humiliated in front of essentially insignificance in comparison with him. An alien is a god, he knows the secrets of many generations and peoples. But now, a bunch of some wimps appeared who decided to kill him, and he just dripped. Either he will make a new hand, then he will give up the sword that can destroy him, then he will begin to justify himself in the most stupid way: ""Was all the sacrifices in vain?"" For revealing characters 0/10. Graphics: The same graphics as in the second part, perhaps the textures were corrected in some places. You will not see anything new in terms of the grafon here. Setting: The same islands, only now we are running along some monotonous streets, in some places we have been in the second part, but you no longer get such emotions. In Dishonored 2, I wanted to climb every corner, every lane, look into every apartment, because somewhere I could get lost, somewhere to communicate with the same Aliens, and now all this is gone. Although, this topic is already for the next point. Chips: This is my favorite part. Developed all so well that I don't even know where to start. Okay, the first is the rejection of runes and altars. I don't know if you can imagine Dishonored without these things, personally I don't. For the sake of which I climbed every house in the second part, they just took it and threw it away. For that we were given a couple of abilities from the very beginning of the game and forced to look for some fucking amulets, which I personally neglected in Dishonored 2. This only aggravated my opinion about the already poor * game. Well, the last nail in the coffin of Dishonored: Death Of The Outsider was the rejection of the chaos system. Well, it's just f * ck. You can come to any location, collect all the bots in one room, sentence each guard to quartering, quietly dump from there and everyone will absolutely * oops. The game only motivates you to move on to the next fucking locations, to fucking degenerate bots with Down syndrome, which at a high level of difficulty will shoot at the wall if they notice you. And at the end of the game, the heroine can easily change her mind about the main ""antagonist"" of this game. How many pompous phrases were said to the Alien, how many times Billy and Dowd called him ""black-eyed bastard"", and in the end she is easily ready to take his side, with the words ""he became a deity not of his own free will, he is good"" and you know what Dowd will call him ""poor"" in all seriousness. When I heard this I was just in a * yea, from the fact that the whole game to only heard about how good it would be to dunk the Alien. I don't know what kind of hard drugs the writers were on when they wrote this ... You know, this idea could have spawned a good spin-off with new interesting characters, after a couple of decades, when the Alien could really become a really negative hero, arrange complete fucking on the Island Empire, when a gang of Protestants appears, etc. Even now I may not have come up with the most original idea, but it would still be better than what came out. This is the only game I've played with a constant feeling of ""come on, come on, come on, end already"", and this is one of my favorite series of games in general. But this game has better reviews on Steam than Dishonored 2, although half of Dishonored DOTO's chips were slept from there. From now on, I will be more careful with the choice of games.

"Wouldn't recommend. Stupid game. Developers don't give a damn about the players, with every update it gets worse and worse. There is no balance, the survivors are ochidodrocheras. upd: 02/29/20: Complementing my negative review. I played enough in this game for 1k hours, it seems that something began to turn out in this game, but updates .... With each update, something better is added, and something worse. The developers make strong mana, but did not provide for discords, skype, parties, toxics, etc. Players begin to complain that it is impossible to play for mana, then the developers will fix the mana, cut the possibilities for the surv, but the party is not a hindrance. Survivors complain about strong, skillful mana, who played 1k hours for one mana and plays like a god. Developers rework mana by cutting down on his abilities. It happened with a nyursa (nurse). The strongest man in the game if you have arms from your shoulders. Haven't played dbd for about a year. I decided to download, see a bunch of updates for the year. I choose my favorite mana - ""nyursu"" and what I see. There is a limit on blinks, they are very short, long, and even limited with a rollback. At rank 20, against the same twenty with 20 hours and 1k mine did not make a single minus, at the same time, as a year ago, without perks and add-ons, against toxics with toolboxes and sawing hooks, I made minus 4. I played against famous streamers with 4k-8k hours and did minus 2-4 against the party. One of the updates, the developers killed this mana. Personally, I have a weak computer and the graph has become unrealistically soapy, that after 20 meters I don't see a fucking thing, if I see it like a person without glasses. The idea of ​​the game is not bad, when the game came out it was great, but we developed and killed this game. Toxics appeared in the form of ochido, etc., their imitators appeared and began to terrorize the players, the developers had to make changes, but with each of their decisions, the game only got worse. There are many options to get rid of toxics, you just need to sit down and think, but the developers are not interested, it is much better to donate for bright, toxic clothes for toxicants. Initially, the game was about stealth, survival and hide and seek from a maniac. Now, it is who will play whom, either the survivor will troll mana, or the man will be trolled by the surva. No hide and seek, no stealth, no respect. The game has become poppy, don't buy and don't waste time. ",False,False

"Its pretty well known at this point that the hitboxes in this game (especially crash 1) are total garbage.  To name a few examples: Sliding off the edge of platforms you clearly landed on, getting hit by attacks when you are outside their visual range, and getting stuck between colliding hitboxes (this actually happened to me in Crash 1 on Heavy Machinery, I got damaged with a mask and the auto-jump that occurs when you get damaged trapped me indefinitely between two lava pipes) They can be frustrating enough just when playing through the story, but trying to go for relic runs is just brutal. And don't even get me started on whatever idiot decided it was a good idea to make NITRO BOXES RANDOMLY LEAP INTO THE FREAKING AIR! I just love doing a relic run making good time only for it to be completely ruined by nitro box rng (yes its completely random, I've checked) So IMO, save your money and just emulate the original games instead. The experience is not nearly as enjoyable as it should've been. Its like this: Would you rather drive and older and more reliable car, or a complete lemon with a pretty paint job? For me the former wins, and I'm sure that after playing the originals again most would feel the same. EDIT: After finally getting all achievements in this game I wanted to make it clear that I do enjoy this game, just not on the same level as the originals due to some questionable changes to game mechanics. Despite the hair loss some of these levels have cost me (Stormy Ascent and Future Tense, looking at you here) I am happy that this game exists if only to remind people that this great franchise exists.

"Although I really want to give this game a good review, obviously it still has problems. At first I thought it was a fun jigsaw game like Isaac, but he didn't surprise me too much. +The cool weapon system in the game trailer. I didn’t realize that getting a new weapon is harder than climbing to the sky. + Tasteless scenes + rare monsters. The main thing is + nightmarish difficulty bosses are all disappointing. The boss’s high blood volume and brainless barrage attacks really make ordinary players a headache. The difficulty of the boss in the first level is comparable to Isaac’s final boss, but the player can only use a small gun with a very low attack power to the boss. Tickling eventually died in the rain of bullets and bullets from the boss. At the same time, it was harder to get supplies in the game, and the items that were harder to get in the game did not play a practical role in the game. It’s understandable that the current game is particularly well-received because the game does have some advantages: + lovely retro pixel style + brilliant and colorful graphics + distinctive animation features + some relatively novel designs, but I still think their colorful graphics are overwhelmed. If your mind is touched by the player, you will really enjoy it. However, this game is not very friendly to ordinary players and it will feel very monotonous after playing a few times. It is not recommended to buy it if it is tentacle. At least I am very disappointed with it. If the official has a big update or rectification of the game in the future, it may be worth a try. Finally, I hope the official will see: its a good game but its too hard for us not friendly! ! ! ! ! ",False,False

"In this game you play a morally good person who falls into a web of evil plots. You got an assignment of a woman with a very visible face to protect a girl through the course of the game. Taking pity on this girl, because you understand her feelings you try to uncover the truth and try to stop the evil characters trying to capture her. The game features a deep story. Many morally bad actions by antagonists to portrait them as villains. The chance to cover behind almost all invironment. Sneaking like Deus Ex: Human Revolution where you have to try to hide out of the sight of everyone. The game is very contextual. The game is optimised for multiplayer, having leaderboards and challenges. And the levels consist mostly of going to point A to point B. And after saying all this I wonder in what way this game is linked to the Hitman-series... Hitman was one of my favorite series ever made. Every new title they made the game only better and better, untill they came to the beautiful point of Blood Money. Now they decided to make a story-driven game and take away all the things which made a hitman game a hitman game. I heard of the flaws of the game and didn't want to buy it (even though I loved every Hitman game before), but one day I could buy this game for 1 dollar on humble bundle, so I did. Hitman isn't a simpathetic man which is doing a job which (like Diana says in the game) ""used to have honor"". I'm strongly disappointed, but the thing is... I knew I would be. If you want a good sneaking game go play Hitman Blood Money or Thief gold or two... Oh and about the latter, square enix ruined that game too! ",False,False

"The game for the new film. A VR game from Sony for 4.99 with a new film license doesn't sound too bad after all. We start the game at the beginning we have a room with the known Jumanji board which we only have to touch with the hand. This is followed by a very small intro that is made up of characters from the film and the game. The impression is still GOOD. OK, we are in the game, a small world is displayed in the manner of a tapletop, we control a figure (The Rock) to the beginning, it just looks like you are playing with action dolls. The impression is still ok, it looks nice and it's a cool gameplay. First puzzles solved, move a few stones out of the way and put a tree with your hand over a ravine to free Jack BLack from his cage. You can move all physics objects which makes killing the enemy very easy because you steal barrels that explode to enemies and it Then you can not blow it up with your own hand with the game pieces. Ok 3 minutes later no new puzzle (just put trees over ravines) all figures freed all opponents killed, m ok shout the stone in the eye JUMMMAJJJIII and yes ne now the game is finished.

"As a CS fan (playing ever since 1.5) I cannot help but compare this to older counter strike games in the series.This is a long list, but it will help you out if you are stuck between buying this game or to save up for another. Imo it's nothing more than a knockoff of Counter-Strike:Source. Pros; 1_) Is a good game to gather friends around and have some fun time with Can't really find any other good changes in comparison to counter-strike source.It's got this hype about it only because it was well advertised and people get a hardon for weapon skins for whatever reason. Reasons why you should not buy this game: Cons; 1_) It's basically counter-strike:source with broken mechanics and cosmetics (You can customize CS:S for free anyway using mods) 2_) Hit detection is as bad as it gets.There are a ton of videos with a shot being a hit but it is not registered.    3_) 64 Tick rate in competitive servers.Really valve? It's COMPETITIVE.Even a regular dedicated server had 128 tick rate in CS:S - 1.6 and even still in CS:GO 4_) It's full of meme spamming squeeky kids thanks to it's similiar to TF2 item system. 5_) Has a smaller modding community.Counter strike 1.6 and CS:S had the largest modding community I've ever seen for a FPS game.This is because the game interface kinda forces you to queue up for regular/ranked games rather than browse community servers. People think they can prove their FPS skill by playing this game to get a higher rank.I think otherwise even though I'm one of those to carry the team, most of the time 1st on the scoreboard, I think ranking is about; 1_) Servers got 64 tick rate, anyone with medium-high ping are considered easy targets, since tick rate effects low ping people the least. 2_) Your rank is about how much you play it.You can just join ranked, get a good team and have them carry you to victory, then you'll get a better rank without effort ",False,False

You start with a fully fledged base of operations! With good graphics and RPG elements, RAMS has a TON of potential. --- --- : Pretty straight forward, it's hard to mess with an fps set up. Still, the hand to hand combat seems to be a bit funky with hits not landing when they should and some hits landing when they shouldn't. : The player starts the match on a train moving through the landscape where most battle royale's will have you in the air, giving you a more 3 dimensional approach to your original spawn, where the train is a 2 dimensional, leaving it easy for players to see when another player gets off the train and able to hunt them down quickly. Furthermore, you start matches with weapons, which, once again, wouldn't be a problem if the spawn system was a bit different. In it's current state, it's too easy to hop off the train right after someone else and gank other players making the already short games far shorter when there's only two people. : Pretty solid. After the match is done you get a good amount of money so you can buy more weapons and ammo.  I'm sure eventually customization options will allow you to buy cosmetics for your base. --- --- :  Good graphics. I haven't seen much of the environment because of previously mentioned spawn camping and games with only 2-4 players.  : Basic, however it seems that in the future there will be customization, but as of right now there's nothing special to note, good or bad. : Crouching is too fast and feels unnatural, when you jump your arms stretch straight in front of you, other than that everything seems a bit clunky but otherwise fine. : Straight forward, your general fps interface in matches but what I really like is how your home base acts as the main menu with a straight forward 'e' to activate and 'alt' to allow cursor to select menus. --- --- : The only bug I saw was while waiting in the lobby for a game random player models would kind of pop in on the spawn point. Nothing that breaks the game as far as I saw. : Solid performance, no lag on my end. However, without a full match of players to test the performance of the game you'll have to take this with a grain of salt. --- --- : Has potential in the future if the devs can attract a larger player base. : I would certainly not be happy paying 12$ for this. I frown upon non free to play games that have any sort of system where you can buy in game currency. On top of that, the game is currently unable to be completely experienced without the ability to play a full match.  The dev's should honestly think of making this a free to play title and have more in game items to purchase such as early development donation skins for weapons and players. --- --- There's a base of a game here, but no real gameplay in sight. No one is going to pay for this in it's current state if they see the reviews first. There's no one playing and if you get lucky enough to get into a match or two, it's only going to be against a couple players.  However, if the devs take my advice and make the game free to play with in game purchases, I feel that the player base would grow quickly and make the game a bit more worth playing.  Until then, I feel that this game is will not succeed on the current market, it simply doesn't have enough to offer that other, popular games already offer for free. In case the devs do take my advice and make this free to play, giving those that purchased it some sort of compensation, I'll keep this game on my radar and re-review it in the future.

It's unfortunate that I have to do this, but I can't just sit here without exposing Bugbear for their shady practices that have been haunting the game's development. After many years, the game is still an unfinished mess, Digital Deluxe backers still don't have their perks and now... they made a new game and they are already developing consoles versions of Wreckfest without finishing the PC version first. It's clear that they are squeezing as much money as they can right now, so they blatantly screw their customers without giving a rat's butt about their reputation. The new game they made, is free for people who backed Wreckfest on their site. YET, people like me who bought the game on Steam for the same price, don't get the new game for free.
