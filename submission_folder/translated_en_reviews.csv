"The story, which begins as a banal search for the missing son of the protagonist, develops, becomes something much more complex and full of ethical questions. As in Fallout: New Vegas, we find ourselves embroiled in a confrontation between several factions fighting for control of the region, and we decide which of their far from perfect philosophies to join, and which worldview to adopt. All this sometimes makes you press ""pause"" and think carefully about your potential choice. Even for joining the highly dubious Institute, one can find good reasons. And the later decision to leave them and go their own way was by no means as easy as I expected. In addition, I was almost shocked at the sympathy local villains can evoke - even the most inveterate killer, the scriptwriters managed to make a person with their own motives and remnants of humanity.

"First of all, I would like to thank the connoisseurs for sharing the KEY. At the beginning, I learned that this game originated from the heated discussion caused by the development team during the Modian crowdfunding two years ago. Since the beginning of crowdfunding, this game has been a controversial game work. It has been questioned by players because of copyright issues and the slow progress of game development. But like me, who have many memories of both the RGP version and the arcade version of ""Swallowing the World"", the post-90s generation is undoubtedly very excited to see high-definition fan works like ""Swallowing Kong Ming Chuan"" on steam. ""Swallowing Kong Ming Biography"" has eight chapters. In addition to some original lines, the plot has also been adapted from the original. The theme of the Three Kingdoms has always been a favorite of Chinese players, and it is undoubtedly exciting to conquer one after another legendary generals and fight in the Quartet. Although the core gameplay of the game is inherited from ""Swallowing Heaven and Earth"", the development of the main storyline and the subsequent capture of the generals in the wild are full of Japanese RPG flavors, but the rich and beautiful BGM of the game and the individual character dubbing of the generals fighting also do not reflect this work. High quality as an independent game. And many details, such as changing the climate as the scene switches, and the exclusive skills of each general, are also worthy of the players to savor. To be honest, with the increasing prosperity of the game market, more commercialization and fast-food, players have a variety of game choices, and this game is a traditional RPG that requires players to devote time to it. I hope you are approaching or stepping forward. The feelings of the player in the year, after life and work in this work to retrieve memories. Finally, a few suggestions: 1. I hope that the AI can give priority to attacking the remaining blood enemies in the automatic battle. 2. The wandering route of the NPC in the city should not include a narrow terrain (it is often annoying for a team of people to be stuck in the terrain for a few seconds by an NPC) 3. The enemy rate is too high, and the explosion rate is very low. Without the incentive of equipment or item rewards, the player is easy to be annoyed by endless miscellaneous soldiers. ",True,False

"Bot Colony is an ambitious title, aiming to provide a non-scripted story by allowing you to freely converse with robots. If you enjoyed literary works like 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep', Isaac Asimov's Robot series, movies like 'Space Oddysey 2001'(not one of my favorites though) or Anime like 'Ghost in the Shell' and 'Psycho-Pass', you'll find a similar setting here.  An important remark is that most of the gameplay is text (or speech) conversations, which at times can be both agitating and humorous, and that might not appeal to everyone.  Currently, the game is made of 2 episodes: Intruder and Arrival.   You have 2 objectives. The first one is erasing evidence of a thief breaking into the house, by commanding a robot (Jimmy). The other one is an investigation mission, which you can do at the same time, in which you question Jimmy about what happened at the house in the last 48 hrs. Jimmy will be saying some of his remarks/facts while moving around the house, which can be used as hints to what to ask. Although it might be a struggle at first, once you get used to commanding Jimmy (i recommend reading through  ). This is the first ""real mission"". it consists of multiple objectives that you'll discover while playing, talking with the receptionist, finding your luggage, , getting a ride to your next location. A memorable moment was the talk with Charlie, a cleaner bot who'll help you with getting your ride.     I enjoyed my playtime with BotColony and I'll be waiting for any further updates. If you have any interest on how the robots operate and your interaction with them, I'm sure you'll also enjoy it. While if you're only focused on 'the result' or why the robot isn't doing what you 'clearly' are telling it, you might have a rough ride. Keep also in mind that the game is an early access title, and not everything is polished yet. I played mostly through typing, Voice recognition is pretty decent with the new Microsoft API, but i find it more convenient to type. That said, voice recognition is not made by the developers and is one of the best available on the market. Also the devs like to hear community feedback, so feel free to drop your thoughts on the forums. ",True,True

"An 8/10 Game. If you are a Hack'N'Slash lover, this will be a great option. This game is a great creation, it is simply worth the full price, I had already tried it before it was on steam, in case I finished it before that is why I have not spent so much time on it, but at least it took about 30 hours game mine without getting bored. This game has Pros and Cons some of which would go like. Pros: ~ The game is very well designed ~ It has support for controllers from Xbox 360, Dualshock 3 and Dualshock 4 ~ An incredible gameplay, very varied. ~ Various upgrades for each type of attack or movement ~ A little story. ~ No loss is understandable at all times by watching the tutorial. Cons: ~ It does not have as many levels as expected, a big update is needed for more levels. ~ It does not have any multiplayer mode although this does not affect me especially, I am entertained equally. ~ Lacks balance when it comes to damage. In itself it is all the bad that I see, the rest is good, The Game is a great experience. ",True,False

"And I like the direction in which NSF is developing. Let MV and the underground remain in our heart. Since NSF 2015 is a very cool concept, the plot sags in places, but now I most of all get pleasure from high speeds, tuning of cars, which is more and more with each part. The sounds in this part are well chosen, there are 5 tracks that are direct VIN and I wait every time they play, and only 1 song is annoying, the rest are middle ones and are not even annoying, and there are 70+ tracks. Stable FPS at maximum speed, and as always, the NSF has excellent control. As established, the whole day rolled and the pleasure was received to the maximum. One of the drawbacks, races against people are implemented crookedly, there is no selection in terms of power, only drive with friends, or negotiate power, But how many I drove with random, people with top cars waited at the finish line and missed.

"Behind the uncomplicated facade of a little-known shooter originally from 2007, there is a good game with an interesting plot. Despite the simple plot - the old love Lydia comes to a prospector in years named Arnold Weiss, and asks to find out the fate of her beloved Warren (by the way, Arnie's best friend). At the mine where the specific mineral Hubbardium (named, apparently, after Ron Hubbard) is mined, an accident occurred, the connection was interrupted, and all attempts to get to the bottom of the truth were in vain. Taking his feet in hand, our hero goes to Alpha Prime in order to sort things out personally. However, upon arrival, it turns out that everything is far from simple. An elementary plot turns into a case in which each character stands his ground, accusing others, and it does not work to catch someone in a lie - all that remains is to move along the plot. Fortunately, the gameplay here is by no means experimental - a classic shooter with a dozen types of weapons, angry soldiers and corridor locations. Finding out more and more details of what happened, and getting more and more confused, Arnold Weiss travels around the station, destroying robots, special forces teams, and also workers who have lost their minds. And I must say, the enemies will not be merciful to old Arnold - first-aid kits are not honored on Alpha Prime, treatment machines are less common than the most valuable ore, and soldiers have no more handfuls of cartridges in their pockets. When choosing ""Hard"" at the beginning of the game, keep in mind that 100 health points evaporate faster than oxygen in the rarefied atmosphere of the planet. Even a couple of soldiers smoking peacefully in the cafeteria can become a serious obstacle to the goal. Fortunately, no one took away the player's ingenuity - you can throw a grenade around the corner, wait for the soldier to rush into battle, or throw in a Hubbardium, getting a sort of slow-mo (but not so effective - you can't count on the effect from Duty Calls worth it). However, in one thing it is more than useful - when you need to put a couple of bullets in the head from a long distance, and the cartridges, as they say, are left at the very bottom. There are also a couple of curious mechanics, working physics (you can remove the lids from the boxes, searching everything around), 1 extremely non-trivial level and, surprisingly, an excellent ending. The main plot intrigue was worth it, whatever one may say. The game is one playthrough, but at the same time it became a pleasant find in the bins of the library for the May holidays.

"People tend to speak up only when they are dissatisfied. Hope that more players who like the law of infinity will not be shy to praise. There are many bad games destroyed by the development team's arbitrariness. But there are too many good games that have been ruined by players because they are too weak. Of course, the Northern Lights have to let them know what they did wrong. Players who really like ROE will even make the noise more fierce and fierce than the spray. Let them understand where they are doing the right thing. For a game, it is more conducive to growth. I discovered very early that everything seems to be on par with PUBG from sideways. The ""egg shell"" on Miss Tiancha's head was also sprayed out by these sprays. From then on, the sweet little sister who emerged from the sight suddenly became a boy scout with a lid on her head. . . The character style is too bad. (If you don't understand, try to recall the approximate amount that you, the women around you, or the women around others pay for their hair and hats each year.) Are these sprays ""3D printers""? ! Just spray out what you want, right? Why don't you spray armor or light and shadow effects on the shield of Fortnite? . . At least when the northern lights issue an update announcement stating that special characters in the enemy's perspective will wear helmets. I have never fought against the Tanzi nor communicated with the opening team. I feel deeply sorry. Having said that, I would like to nominate a ""Best Developer Award"" for the update frequency of Northern Lights and the attitude of listening to opinions. It's a pity that there is no developer page in Steam, so I can't search the awards temporarily. . . Then I had to vote for the Polish stupid donkey. The hateful thing is that the sprayer is now jumping wildly around, planning to spray back the robot specially set up for novices. Are those novices with a KD ratio of a few tenths only worthy of being abused by veterans to enhance their gaming experience? Or are those anchors who are afraid that if they don't play the trumpet, they will not be able to abuse Mengxin and lose the program effect, so they are so anxious that they pull the brainstorming fans all over the world with rhythm? Or there are some speculative merchants who see that ROE does not open the market and want to spray players back to PUBG to increase the price of accessories? ""When I get better, I will go back."" This kind of determination is impossible for novices to possess. Many games racked their brains and are designed to be ""easy to learn but difficult to master"", isn't it just to increase positive feedback at the beginning of the game to retain newcomers? Recall that after GTA and the like have no fresh blood, they can only be maintained by their loyalty. How has the circle of domestic players shrunk into? What's more, the official said at the first time that there will be no robots when the technology improves! So isn't it just the recruits who can't wait to hold the gun and even take the wrong ammunition? Especially when I saw some remarks that I really want to cover my face when the robot is swiping around and revealing its position. First of all, I don't understand why the robot is brushing around. . . Where does this God theory come from? Will you become a living person or will all the robots on the Magneto map rush to you? Secondly, even if you expose yourself after killing the robot. But compared with death, novices also get some happiness and some positive feedback. The level of improvement for the technology in the early days of Cultivation is definitely far greater than that of a missed shot or death without a shot. I have never been able to understand the problem of turning sideways at first. Sideways behind the bunker is not enough. I have to make a fuss about getting the button back sideways. Is this function to twist and avoid headshots in the open space? Others say that you cannot turn sideways without leaning on the bunker. If time is really so urgent, there is still time to rely on bunker? Have you found the bunker and you still have to press W to move forward? To put it bluntly, it's not that the habit is not easy to change, and I want to press one more QE after the bunker, and everyone will suffer. . . This issue has also been mentioned in a post that has been replied by the official Northern Lights staff. Nowadays, no one mentions it after a long time. As mentioned at the beginning: If it is really angry and complaining, don't talk about it. Players who really like ROE are more troubled. The Northern Lights were very principled. The same are colored glasses. When the fan sees that it is Tencent, he can only see plagiarism and krypton gold. But what we found when we saw domestic production was a breakthrough and the tolerance that should be given to it! Finally, I will explain my very thin experience in battle royale games: PUBG is not interested at all. Battle Royale in Fortnite hasn't been played in Survival Mode for a long time. Although Realm Royale's eyes are bright, the follow-up is weak. The longest H1Z1 has only been played for more than 200 hours in total (Dawn, you pay back my hard-earned money!!) and then somehow entered the pit of the law of infinity. It's only two months since it opened, and it has played for more than 100 hours. Maybe the sprayer will say that you dare to use this data to represent other players as soon as you BR Xiaobai? I'm sorry I can't represent it alone. But at least the Law of Infinity made me, a player who has never had a cold on Battle Royale, attracted and stayed here. This is my feelings for the Northern Lights, who has never played Tianya Mingyue Knife. After dinner, I worked overtime until five o'clock in the morning. Now my head is stunned by the smoke and I can't move too much. Don't care too much about rhetoric and paragraphs. A few lines of remarks are concise and not so tactful. I'm too busy at work and I really don't have time to be a navy so I'm not afraid of being sprayed. As long as IQ is talking online, its okay for me to copy the replies into this text. ",True,True

"Despite the fact that over the last few years, many titles with a ""truck"" theme have appeared on the market, the anticipation of the premiere of Euro Truck Simulator 2 was accompanied by real tension, additionally boosted by further postponements of the debut date. I am not an avid ""trucker"" myself, but I have made shorter or longer romances with many similar productions, starting from the legendary Hard Truck 2. ETS 2 has got on the list of games that I just have to start especially thanks to the coolly realized Trucks & Trailers and this year's Scania Truck Driving Simulator. And although ETS 2 is not a revelation for the genre in general, this title has many advantages that will be appreciated by all those who love driving a truck. When you start Euro Truck Simulator 2 for the first time, the most noticeable thing is the vast map, with a really dense network of roads and highways. It ranges from Great Britain, through France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia to Poland. Some countries were treated a bit neglectively - for example, Italy or Poland are only three cities and a few roads, but also good. Individual countries differ in terms of the appearance of the roads and the climate, but there are no diametrical differences between them - maybe except for Great Britain, which of course we move on the left side of the road, which is a nice diversion for a person living in the country with traffic on the right. In my opinion, cities are a bit disappointing - huge metropolises at best resemble small towns and consist of a dozen or so roads; fortunately, they were not created based on the same patterns as in previous games of this genre, so we do not drive clone cities that differ only in names. And fortunately, because it would probably be too powerful, though not the only blow to realism inflicted by the ETS 2. For example, when driving through the Kodzko Valley towards the Czech Republic, I did not feel completely different than driving the Pozna - Szczecin route, and yet the characteristics of the area and the surrounding landscape should be radically different. Therefore, as a result, I started to wonder if I would prefer, instead of several countries, one, maybe even fictional, but rendered in a really detailed way - mountains and valleys, forests and deserts, lakes and rivers, highways, national roads and small, forgotten passages between only a few , but well-prepared and dedicated cities ... But of course that's just my dream. :) ",True,False
"Purity without a touch of vulgarity and platitude. Hatred without restrictions of common sense. Love without saccharine. A few distinct personalities, caught in the circumstances or making their own mistakes. Which tragedies will they have to face? How will they overcome or succumb? This story has its unique charm and style. Outstanding visuals and fitting music, blending in with the story. The characters are well-written and alive. The text on its own has a great language. This story is filled with beautiful sayings and events. It has quite a share of surprises and sudden moments which will catch you off guard. It's a long game and I'd prefer the last chapter to be shorter. After the promise of the final closure, I was waiting far too long for it to actually happen. Some music tracks are way too repetitive, especially the happy ones. And even though I really like the way how it's written, the amount of ""......"" is sometimes too annoying. In the end I liked this game, I liked this story. And I really liked some of the characters who felt like good acquaintances of mine in the end.  I picked up this game because of it being constantly called ""the best visual novel on Steam"". I finished it looking at all the entangled threads being tied together in a single picture.

"One of the best indie games I've played in a long time. You are quickly thrown into the game and after the first 3 minutes of play you have full freedom of choice. This game attracts you quickly and has the potential to be played for several hours in a row, but it is also perfect for ""in between times"". Music and graphics are consistent and despite the pixel graphics, it looks chic with shaders and effects. For the price I give a clear buy recommendation, I bought it for less than 2 euros. The map is very large and you are not limited in terms of creativity when it comes to your own pirates or the ship. There is complete freedom of choice over names and looks. Even if the soundtrack is consistent and the noises match the game, they can appear annoying for a long time. At some point, the high-pitched pirate voices only produce a high-pitched and annoying tone if you select several at once. Another minus point are the successes / achievements. Many of them are bent and do not activate themselves, although all tasks have been completed several times. (It wasn't just me) One of the achievements was unfortunately tied to Christmas and can no longer be unlocked. Despite small mistakes, the game offers a convincing pirate feeling and a multifaceted atmosphere. The world is packed with little secrets and exciting encounters.

There are many little things that you have to pay attention to. E.g. with the clue you can see if there are other players nearby when it lights up in red instead of white. What I find so awesome about Hunt is that there are different methods of killing the many zombies. Mugs must not be struck with the blade, or you should find axes at the bosses or burn them with the lamps. All in a nutshell: Very ingenious game where people really made an effort and thought!

I decided to ask where you can buy an apartment for a thing. And in response to me - we plowed for me, I will pack. And I was shocked at what a beautiful semi-glass skyscraper. He turned out to be a VIP and I had to give him 3 things for all my money. I settled in, there was no bed or furniture, for that VIP, I lie like this on the glass floor, a cleaning lady came to me to clean and told me. - Uhadi atsudava, I left to clean up. She was blonde, polygonal boobs, ass and head. When I left the room, I went into it and I liked her empty head. I asked her to get married and she agreed. Here comes the wedding and suddenly comes a knight in a blue and yellow suit and her brother in a black knight suit. I was scared, suddenly a woman who looked like a bum came and began to speak her phrases. And she asks - You saglasin to marry Marya Ivanuvna? I breathed and said yes, she began to beat me with a pickaxe and I yelled, And this family of Ivynuvs began to hammer at me and said: -hadi bistra mi tibya neither loved me tibya schA banim. And then I could not escape some bum who was given to build, I leveled a hole of 2 cubes, I fell into it. The Ivanuvny began to beat me on the head with a pick and I died.

"Wow, just like I expected I just really love RhinoGearz Visual Novels. The writing, story telling and just in general how he likes to form romance stories and relationships just really fits with my own personal likings. You play a young guy entering a magic academy and finding the love of your life in it. The relationship development is really nice and I also really enjoyed the overall story apart from the romance itself. Considering that you also get around 4 hours of story and that it is only 2 euro, I will never understand why his games dont take off more. For this price you wont find anything better on steam when it comes to romance VNs and just overall positive story telling.  If you are looking for a positive and very relaxing read then highly recommended. There is no r18 content though so if you are looking for that you might want to look elsewhere.

"1. I'll start my article with the fact that the game is now driven only by donat. In all senses, I start from imbalance, ending with the fact that this game is developed for the sake of donators (thank God, at least somehow) 2. I would not say that this is a clone of total influence, the engine is one .... but the game is played in a completely different way. 3. Lots of small chips and constant promotions. 4. Sufficient flexibility of the gameplay, unlike total influence, where everything was done at random. (or vice versa too difficult) 5. Unbalanced ranks. In the beginning, guys with machine guns worship, then grenade launchers to rank 3. and so constantly on a curve. there is something better at every rank than you have. 6. play no more than 2 snouts, otherwise the coordination of actions is worse than that of bots. 7. few players online or all players are at certain ranks. From which it follows that it is difficult to meet at least someone, for example a rank of 3. Well, this is in short. comparing all this, I can say one thing, everything is in the hands of developers. Either it will be a donat that sets the ass on fire to a prolitaria, or something mundane with a Danat as in HERE. Well ... and I advise you to familiarize yourself. ",True,False

"My rating for the game - 7.0 Duration of the main plot ~ 10 hours No story Dlc - Visual series - 6.5. The graphics are average here as for 2012. Not bad in places, but more often soap. In addition, here, as in most games of that time, there is a filthy Bloom effect; -Gameplay - 8.0. An action-packed shooter with a cover system, ""tactical elements"" and ""run for space"" - this is perhaps the most comprehensive characteristic. The shooting mechanics are really not the most pleasant, but the shootings here are competently diluted with chases, ""peaceful locations"" and other activities. There is also a rather pleasant mechanic of shooting limbs to robots, like the one that was previously presented in Dead Space; -Plot - 6.5. In general, the plot is interesting, although never original and completely linear. But this is usually the norm for shooters. Everything is served cool, of course, the production and direction are at their best. There are interesting twists, good humor and, albeit very primitive, but communication with partners at the ready with the system of their loyalty to you; -Sound and music - 7.0. I did not find anything remarkable in the sounds. It is fully consistent with the genre and status of the game. But the music is solid and sets the pace for the game well. But for some reason it was made very quiet here, and the ability to adjust its volume was not added. DLC's: there are only 2 dlc's in the game and they are clearly not worth attention.  The first adds content for multiplayer, which is not and which is not needed in this game;  In the second, a number of improvements to the abilities of the GG and his gun. That in principle does not have much influence on the single. Bottom line: the game is a typical mediocre third-person shooter for those years. I disagree with the fact that many call it undervalued. Rather, it was simply not in demand at that time (like Spec Ops: The Line, for example). In 2012, a lot of games were released that were more interesting and of higher quality (for example, Max Payne 3). The game can be safely taken without dlc. The closest similar games are Spec Ops: The Line and Max Payne 3 of the same years, as well as Gears of War (2006). ",True,False

"Old, but not lost its relevance. The game offers us several modes that have long become classics for games of this genre, namely: Capturing and holding points, destroying objects and .. that's it. Well, actually, what did you expect from the 2005 game? There are player-created servers, but here the variety of gameplay may surprise you. However, another component of the game is the system of classes, each of which has its own key role on the battlefield: Some are designed for close combat, others are most effective at long distances. And each has its own peculiarity, whether it be covering the comrades-in-arms with a smoke screen or an extremely high rate of fire that allows you to treat the enemy with lead just at the speed of a schoolboy flying on Friday from the last lesson to his computer. In short, you will find something to do on the battlefield. It differs from its original in more pleasant graphics (it's clear, the resource did its job), the class system and other small amenities. Regarding online: I can't say for sure, because I have met harsh guys more often than representatives of our generation. It doesn't bother me much, it even amuses me a little. Outcome: What can I say? Classics, and nothing more. There is a goal of the game, there are classes for achieving the corresponding goal, there are also enemies that must be killed. With graphics, everything is bearable, unless you are a capricious graphomaniac. Cards are sometimes striking in their size, which also involuntarily raises a smile. Immersion in a military atmosphere is guaranteed. If you find money, take it, but I would advise you to buy the game at a discount, because time also does not spare this creation (namely, it is online) and therefore it would be better not to risk it.

"Dota 2 is a computer multiplayer team game of the MOBA genre, the implementation of the famous DotA map for the game Warcraft III in a separate client.

On October 13, 2010 the game was announced for release in 2011 on the Game Informer game portal. On August 15, 2011, a trailer for the game was published on the official blog. The game is played by two teams of five people. One team plays for the light side, the other for the dark side. Each player controls one unit called a hero. The hero can gain experience to increase his level, earn gold, buy and collect items that enhance it or give additional abilities. Each player constantly receives a small amount of gold from his base, and also earns small portions of gold for killing enemy creatures and large portions for killing heroes. Teams are scattered along the lines, on which there is a fight against enemy heroes and squads of creeps under the control of a computer, which appear at the command bases every half a minute.

"At first, cute and tube turns gradually into a fierce brain removal. For many. Probably. I'll tell you what, from the very beginning of this game it was clear that there would be some kind of fierce psychedelic. And so it happened, and it's not bad.

First, she will invite a child to visit her, then there will be dialogues that will ultimately come down to the theme of suicide and morality about the fact that the devil is in everyone. And what we see at first glance, sweet, friendly and innocent, can only be our ideas and first impressions. This shows that we can be wrong in those moments in which we could be 99% right.

"To be honest, after the failure of the Cartel (which I, due to the setting change and bad reviews, did not even play), I did not expect much from Call of Juarez Gunslinger. Developers' experiments with graphic style were also alarming. It was all in vain. Firstly, the game not only largely repeats the style of the first two parts of the series, but also has several pleasant innovations in the gameplay (storytelling style, pumping system, small and quite appropriate QTEs). With graphics, too, complete order - in Techland have always been able to make a great picture. And this time in addition to it, we also get excellent optimization and colorful atmospheric styling. The game is a bit short, but this is not a flaw at all, as it actually has 14 chapters, so make the developers longer, and the game could become already drawn out. So good in moderation! In addition, the game has a very high replay value - it is interesting to pass the same missions for the second and third time. Pros: + Interesting plot and excellent presentation, moderately seasoned with jokes. + The atmosphere of the wild west is perfectly revealed. + High quality graphics and great optimization. + The level design is very varied and pleasing to the eye. + Great soundtrack. Cons: - Localization with subtitles - very often the narration goes during active shootings, so it's simply impossible to keep up with reading the subtitles. This is very disturbing.

Lastly, I just love the animation where you transform into your 'beast form', its really cool xP There are some graphical errors I have found.  ex. If you go to the steam overlay and back into the game, your mouse cursor does not disappear and is just on the screen when you are in the first person perspective playing the game. ",True,False

"I rummaged around in the shop and then saw. The reviews weren't bad, so I put it in the shopping cart and it should be off. I actually only bought it for a little fun in between, just paddling around a bit when my head is on vacation (even a blonde wants to have a vacation;)). So first of all, I couldn't play the game at all. I wanted to start it and was then processed with a white screen, there was a bit of music to be heard in the background, but: Of course, no gamer is happy :( [For everyone who also has the problem: -> to the .exe file and start via ""integrated graphics card"".] When I had fixed the problem after all the tinkering, it started. I started with the story of BattleBlock. And it took about 2 minutes and I was totally crush on the voice of the narrator. And the comments during the levels - just brilliant. I absolutely have to mention the music. You can hear some melodies and they have a rhythm that you have to go along with :) ... Then If you wiggle in front of the PC during the Gems hunt and then look straight away at what the song of the level was called (here's an example [of course only to my liking]:). The game took me about 2.5 hours already completely convinced. The attraction of getting an ""A ++"" is always there. Then you play a level 5 times, so that there is a plus behind the A twice. It's a bit like school, 1st grade ... You really want a bee on the dictation from the German teacher! One is not satisfied with a ""good"" and a frog! I don't want to reveal too much, just that I give one for it. For me it is already one of my favorites. You will be surprised in any case and have 100% fun with it. :) ",True,False

"I'll start by saying I generally don't play hidden object games, the sheer number of them in the market and the fact that so many of them seem to look the same always made me feel like I wouldn't enjoy them.  I was convinced to play this one, though, and I'll admit that I was pleasantly surprised.  None of the puzzles or challenges were too difficult, but even so, there was enough variety that it kept me entertained through to the end (though I did miss the 4 hour time limit for the achievement by about 15 minutes, which meant I had to play through a second time). The only issue I had was during nearly every puzzle, I found myself backing out of them by clicking too close to the bottom of the screen for one reason or another, which did get annoying after a while.  Even after playing the game for hours I didn't seem to be getting any better when it came to this, maybe something like a back arrow somewhere on the screen as an alternative to clicking on the bottom portion to backtrack could help with that.  This is a pretty small complaint though, and most likely something that most people don't have any problems with. ",True,False

"Finished the game,  if you're a Korra fan  if you're not. + Combat is fun it's your basic 'Beat'em Up' + Concepts are interesting & lets you try different things than just montonous combat + Lots of secrets to find if you're into that kind of thing + Skill shop so fighting is completely repetitive + Story is interesting enough to intice the Korra fans to keep playing + Cutscenes are cool and fully animated + Pro.Bending. - There's only like a total of 10 models in this game - Little to nill replayability - Combat is a little choppy at times (not exactly fluid & smooth) - Can't fluently change from one bending to another unless in avatar state It's worth the 15 bucks if you like the Legend of Korra series & you've followed up for the last 2 seasons. So the combat is fun & simplistic, you just beat people to a pulp and move to the next segment. They make it feel really good to counter and throw back punches. Naga running segments is essentially like a runner-mode where you slip and slide through obstacles to get to the next segment, and though it's fun it feels a bit contrived. However, the enemies get stale after awhile there's like 10 models and 3 different palette swaps for each one. However, I do keep in mind that kind of budget the developers were probably working with and can empathize the constriction on the lack of diverse enemies/help from an AI. For a license game The Legend of Korra does alright to stand on its own considering the game is only 15 bucks, but most likely confusing to those who haven't seen the show. *****WARNING: SPOILERS/SECRET CODES BEYOND THIS POINT****** In case you do buy the game I've got some goodies: (note I'm using generic commands since everyone's layout is different) ",True,False

"This is how it happened This is how the Batman die. One of the best games in the series. The most dramatic, the most emotional, unforgettable. The night that loomed over Gotham will not end. And the night is full of fears and dangers, but Batman is ready to challenge again and go to the end. ""That's how it happened That's how Batman died"" The spooky words of the narrator, at the beginning, set the appropriate atmosphere, and adds to the seriousness of the infernal hell of vodka, which burns the body of the Joker in the crematorium. The antagonist died. The final fat dot can it be a coma? Darkness covered the city, which the procurator hated so much But this is from another opera, We will not meet Dvulyky this time. However, there will be enough scary moments. From the epigraph screensaver itself, we will plunge into a calm, at first glance, cafe. Where would you sit and drink coffee and watch the funny visitors, but who is there hooliganizing at the end of the hall? Another smoker decided to drink a little? And well, my friend! .. Holy cow! And a quiet cafe turns into a battlefield. This is how chaos begins. Yes, the city plunges into the night. And those who remained in Gotham, do not envy. The scarecrow will give everyone a good time to taste the nightmares, to feel all the aromas of horror. Moreover, there will be enough rubbish to help him in this. A figure in black watches this ugliness from the roofs of houses and skyscrapers. His night watch is just beginning. And this long night will last a long time, will keep in tension until the near dawn. Such is the fate of the dark knight. The plot of further events will develop in a flash and epic. The adult world of serious male conversations. A bonus and a pleasant gameplay moment in this game is, of course, an updated and mega-functional batmobile. This wheelbarrow has already been pumped and pumped well! Many game moments are connected with it. Dangerous Gotham streets on it will be much safer to move. Moreover, it is full of various criminals who are trying to test the strength of your nerves and your fists. Although some will still swallow dust under the wheels of your Batmobile. With the development of the plot it becomes more and more interesting, well-known antagonists will meet, various persecutions, races, quests, riddles will not let you get bored. And, of course, amused by the appearance of a dead, but still crazy, Joker - his conversations, he will not let Batman miss. Without this green-haired clown in a purple suit, the dark knight would not be the uncompromising fighter for the truth as we know him. Warner Bros. and Rocksteady Studios did their best to present the DC Comics universe in a game that successfully held the bar of previous games in the series and led the franchise to a logical and memorable outcome. DLC add the opportunity to play for other characters, also entertain other costumes and add a traditional element of competition in certain trials. Special mention should be made of the optimization of the PC version of the game. At the time of release, it was poorly optimized and, unlike consoles, had problems: sagging fps, crash games and more. This is described in detail by other users in their reviews. I was a little lucky and on the previous video card (MSI GeForce GTX 580 Lightning) I had no problems with the game. Yes, fps in dynamic scenes sagged to 15-18 frames, but mostly the game was 32-45 frames and did not fly, so at high settings, the game went smoothly. Well, in a few months, the developers have finalized the PC version of the game and released a patch, so the negative feedback has become much less. Now the game is cheaper than three years ago, when it came out, and during the sales the price is also very nice. I recommend to buy and enjoy. P.S. And of course, it would be a crime not to mention the original voice acting of the characters - flawlessly and professionally! And Mark Hamill, who voiced the Joker, is just a genius! Not only will Luke Skywalker be remembered for his performance, but the Joker's unique and recognizable voice will long be associated with him.

The only problem is that it already has a gameplay system that is a bit rough, or not very polished, fortunately these problems were fixed in the next witcher.

"One of my top 5 most played games in my steam library! The sounds, the scenery, the players and the different maps make this game really well-made. There are many opportunities that you can make so even after long hours it won't be boring unlike other games, because you can play as Squad Lead, Infantry, Tank operator, Scout, Pilot or simply Support (logistics and/or super FOB-ing with TOWs and mortars). Not to mention the multiple factions with their own weapons, vehicles, tools and buildings respectively. If you wanted to compare with other games, I would say a really realistic game as Escape from Tarkov (no hitmarks), open-world with vehicles as Arma 3, respawn system and customization as in Red Orchestra and Rising Storm series, but if you just want to kill everyone because you are used to the fast paced CoD series, then this game is not for you: a map can take up to 1,5 hours!

"I really enjoy Telltale games so I'm always on the lookout for similar games and The Descendant is about as close as it gets, albeit less refined. The voice work was a little rough in parts, ranging from serviceable to good depending on the character and the visuals while nothing special did the job, they went for the cel shaded look ala The Walking Dead and co. Gameplay was what you'd expect, walk around finding clues, press the correct button at the correct time and select whichever story choice you prefer. Now for the bad though, it's technically not great (is this genre cursed?), it's a Unity engine game that's capped at 30fps, you have to edit the registry to fix this which is easy enough to do but you'll notice straight away the game is optimised for 30fps, even on medium settings I couldn't hit 60fps in all situations (although to be fair, I did most of the time).

"The game does not have a second ending, and currently there is only a single ending that can be played. But the most curious thing is that there is a closed door in ""Guanluoyin"". Could it be the branch door for another ending? I have no way of knowing this. Even if I walked back on the long corridor that ""faced my heart"", I couldn't leave that long corridor and couldn't go back to the two doors. Do you have any plans to launch DLC in the future? The player needs to operate the protagonist ""Du Fengyu"", understand the current situation of the family through some letter descriptions and some small puzzles, and trigger the event by walking simulation, and then slowly dig out the hidden ""home"" The unbearable truth that is difficult to face. The puzzles of the game are not difficult, and the puzzles are very easy to solve. You don't need to spend too much time and brainpower on the puzzles, so that people can concentrate on the plot experience. Of course! The game will have some scary sections, which will scare you away! There are also some curious actions that stimulate your perception nerves. If you dare not play, don't force it! PS. The only lighting equipment in the game-a lighter, please make good use of it, because some scenes are very dark. As a horror game, horror elements are necessary and one of the characteristics and selling points of this game. First of all, it must be said that the horror atmosphere created by the game is really excellent. It can completely make people feel the psychological pressure brought out by the game atmosphere. This game is really successful. The only scary technique, I personally feel that there is room for improvement. The game uses ""jump scare"" to achieve the effect of fright. It may be a sense of fright for players who are afraid of playing horror games, but for players who play a lot of horror games. It can't produce any effect on it, not that it can't be used, but if it is used too many times, it will make people feel insensible, or even meaningless. If you can slowly pave, brew, and use the ""stamina"" generated by the environment and the plot to bring the player's back to the cold and the creeps, this will not be comparable to more jump scares. .  Just a few minutes after the game started, Xiao Hong Umbrella will give you a note of Mawei. It is undeniable that this frightening effect is very impressive! The scene design of this work is very reminiscent of the time in Taiwan at that time. It is like participating in a nostalgic retro exhibition in the 80s. It makes people feel ""nostalgic"" for an object or photo, whether it is old mottled floor tiles or placed on chairs. The ""Lele"" snacks on the table, the ""Dadong brand"" refrigerator has many X's on it, the home wall has photos of the age, the contact book signed by myself, the bathtub of the ""grandma's house"" in the bathroom, and the dark corridor wall is covered with The leaflets and spells of the game, even TV shows and commercials, are perfectly reproduced. Everything in this game is really remarkable. The exquisite modeling really makes the eyes bright and really makes People were amazed and thanked the red candle production team for their hard work.  The bathtub of ""Grandma's House"" that exists in childhood memories is also restored! The soundtrack in the game is also quite standard. With the introduction of horror atmosphere music, players can be more integrated and immersed in this dark and horrible scene. The sound effects are also quite restored. In the game, you can hear the nostalgic ""tweeting"" bird calling the door bell, the uncle's announcement of ""repairing screen windows, screen doors, changing glass"" outside the window, as well as ""small balls"" and ""cups"". The nursery rhyme of ""Moon Kai"", etc... I personally feel that the soundtrack of the ending ""returns"", coupled with the scene of sister Maxims running forward, unable to catch up with her and leaving you, is the most amazing in this work This is also the most cruel link. I believe all players think so, right? The dubbing is national, and the overall dubbing is great and vivid. Especially when the parents quarreled, I personally think that the interpretation is very vivid, without any sense of violation. There is also the stage of Guanluoyin, the sound performance of pain and fear is quite admirable! This game also indirectly proves that Taiwan still has good voice talents, right? The hostess on TV. Personally, I feel that the picture book suddenly became a 2D style of expression and ""Maxims Little Theater"", which allows the player to become a red dragon in a fish tank, and indirectly understand how Maxim lives and what he is thinking about. Thinking is really creative. In addition to these, there are also changes in the card scene, which also make people feel supernatural, such as ""the room full of tulips"", which is really worth savoring! I am very pleased that the Red Candle Game Production Team has once again created a horror masterpiece that goes international and integrates Taiwan's folk customs. It feels really good to present the game with a 3D screen this time, but the game time is too short, it can be played in three to four hours, and it feels uninteresting. In the end, I didn't see the actual situation of Maxim's behind that door as I wished. Although I generally know what happened, it still makes people a little disappointed. I personally think that the performance of this work is not back to school, but it still makes me very amazing! You are indeed making progress, come on! Looking forward to the next new work, I highly recommend everyone who likes to play horror games! If there is a DLC that can hit the He Shen stick, I will definitely buy it without saying a word! Its really hateful to use the misfortune of others to make oneself earn money! Belief in religion is not to say no, you can take this to seek solace, but everything must be treated rationally. Dont be too blind and superstition to hurt your money, or even cause the tragic situation of family destruction. This is really not worth it. ",True,False

A likeable cast of characters accompany the protagonist on his epic journey across the Star Wars galaxy, from more well known planets like Kasshyyk, the home of the Wookies, to Dathomir, the shrouded home of Darth Maul, Savage Opress and Asajj Ventress as featured in The Clone Wars and Rebels. The Inquisitors are excellent antagonists for this story as well as the beautiful musical score, reminiscent of John Williams iconic pieces for the movies.

"This is the first time I think a game has hooked me so much. Getting this game about 4 days ago, and putting almost 10 hours a day into it, is a worrying amount, but the game just hooks you. It all comes down to some basic aspects that make this game so good, from a gameplay standpoint: The movement and the weapons. The movement is pretty simple, you run around as you might expect, but the dash is really what makes it. Its far enough to get some distance and dodge if you need to, but is also great for when you want to jump around enemies to backstab them, or fighting multiple enemies, jumping from one to another as you see fit. The movement is simple enough for anyone to use, but also allows people with fast hands to really take advantage of some of the games mechanics. The movement puts you in a position where you can be almost perfectly in control of how much damage you take. I think that it has hit a very nice balance. The combat is in a word, satisfying. With a number of different weapons, and a number of different play styles available for each, it really opens the game out with what you can do. The boons and upgrades that you get can also be attributed for this, giving different bonuses, which can compound certain playstyles, or make you switch up your build a little bit for something more fun. The point is, there are loads of different options for you to choose from. Most of the weapons specials, are slower and higher damaging attacks, and when you get that killing blow with them, it does feel good to do so. I think that's what makes the combat so good and keeps me playing so much. *POTENTIAL SPOILERS BELOW* Outside of the gameplay, the story and mini-stories had me wanting to keep playing too, due to the way in which it is revealed to you. Throughout the game, you find out more about Zagreus' mother, what happened between her and Hades, and the change of characters thoughts and attitudes. However there are tons of other character interactions throughout the game that you can take part in, from simply chatting with people in the House or those within the different areas of the Underworld, and being able to give gifts to those same characters in return for some goodies for you to use. Not only are these interactions fun and interesting to do, to find out more about these characters, and how they interact with the others around them.  I think the revealing nature of the story, really kept me motivated to keep playing, as I really wanted to reach the end, beat Hades and see Persephone again, to keep learning more about what happened. *END OF SPOILERS* Overall, I am more than pleased with the story(ies) and its execution. It's great that you can get as invested into them as you like through your choices of who to talk to and who to care about. I have only reached the end of the main story so far, but I am very satisfied with it. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I think that this is a game that many people will enjoy, even those who, like me, was never really into rogue-likes at all. I would definitely recommend to everyone. ",True,False

Also there are a few characters that feel (to me at least) like duds, but in a roster of 20+ characters they cant all be winners and with so many options I'm sure anyone can find at least 2 they like enough to stick with to the end.

"I got this game for 50 euros or so, i preordered it, and I think it's worth of it. Main story is made to be played in about 15 hours or so. The game has some bugs, but not much. Now let's talk about ratings. 1. Graphics Graphics are incredible, a lot of details, great looking cut scenes, enemies have a lot of details, even on lower spec computers. I have mid-high tier computer, and i could play game on 40fps on some great medium settings. 2. Gameplay (combat, jumping, side task, main missions, RPG stuff...) Combat is the most important thing in this game and it's soo *** great, i could even say incredible. Yes it has a small number of bugs but these bugs are irellevant and I passed game without any problems. I saw some bugs in dodging, i mean, sometimes i click dodge button, in my case its CTRL and usually it works, i mean almost always works, maybe it won't work in 1/50 times so it's doesn't matter. Second most important gameplay feature is parkour or jumping, in this game it has a lot of jumping, flying enemies so you have to jump to hit them etc... The parkour is most important in last mission with cap America and it's done great. Sometimes I had problems with Caps wall running but with newer patches it was fixed. Parkour mehanics are simple, with cap you have wall-running, with Miss Marvel and Black Widow you have some kinda hands/grapple hooks that you throw on the ground or tree/pipe... Hulk has simple jumping. Thor and Ironman don't have any parkour mehanics, simple jumping with flying. Side task and main missions are important in every game, same as in Marvel's Avengers, so let's begin. First mission is tutorial and it is showing how to play with every single hero. Personally i like these type of level design, looks like design from God of War (2018). If you have to jump on something or destroy it, it has some kind of a mark, white stripes, red colour on it... When you use tactical awareness, it shows you current objectives and some kind of a soul that shows where you should go. Missions are usually of same kind. Go destroy more enemies, stay in some circle and let Jarvis (your supercomputer) to hack doors, go to elevator destroy some enemies, stop reactor or hack communication or take over defence... There are 2 ways of doing that, capturing zones and guarding them from AIM destroying some kind of generators and stop reactor/engine... RPG stuff is a great part of the game, level rising, gears, gear upgrading, artefacts, skill points... It reminds me of an Assasin's Creed game. There's not much to say it's good, noob friendly and simple. 3. Story I love it. It's good kinda story, i liked it, and enjoyed it. The only thing that i didn't like is introducing new Avenger Khamala Khan (Miss Marvel) but on the other side of the coin, story is very good and enjoyable. I won't spoil it but i recommend to finish the main story, it remains one BIG cliffhanger. There are a lot of cut scenes, with my free guess about a 45 minutes of cut scenes and so. Really enjoyable story. 4. Conclusion If you have 45+ euros to give for game, I would reccomend you to buy it, but you will need a good computer (a lot better than minimum specs). I had 2 PCs, one was with minimum specs other one was with a recommended specs, game runned very badly on the min spec PC but on the one with  a reccommended, runned very well. The game is great and if you are Marvel fan buy it, you won't regret it. If you wanna play multyplayer fell free to add me. ",True,False

"Playway has really done a great job with this one. I enjoyed CMS2014 but they managed to build on that and improve it in almost every way. And all with Kickstarter and a low pledge goal. As the name implies you run an auto shop repair business. But new and improved for 2015 are the cars have many more parts now and the repairs are a good deal more involved. You also earn XP now as you work and complete jobs which can be used to unlock more advanced diagnostic tools like the test path, OBD scanner, compression tester etc and other repair abilities.  There is also an unlockable paint shop now as well so you can do body and paint work and an auction house where you can buy junk cars for parts or fix them up and sell them for profit. Once you earn enough to get the extra parking lot, you can store your cars for service or just collect them. Customers call in on the phone with jobs you can take or decline. An all new better organized parts shop and tablet access eliminates running back and forth to the computer to buy parts. Test driving the vehicle now and using your diagnostic tools generates a parts list condition report for certain systems saving you time poking around and disassembling the vehicle looking for bad parts. All in all there's quite a bit to do and highly recommended if you like puzzle games, working on cars, or are a simulator fan. ",True,False

"Compared to the second generation, I think Company of Heroes 1 is more classic. From the main body of the company of heroes to the resistance front to the legend of courage, it can be said that they are full of green memories. Its a good idea to play with PY at home during the holidays. Its mainly because it doesnt eat configuration, it is more popular, and the picture quality is good. At present, I recommend that you directly enter the legend of courage, you can experience all the content except the first two battles, it is very suitable for online, of course, the campaign party can pass this. Regarding the company of heroes, there are two camps, one is the old beauty, which is the Allied camp, and the other is the old Germany, which is the axis camp. The first expansion piece resists the front line, the Allies joined the British, and the Axis joined the armored division. The second expansion piece The Legend of Courage, in addition to fixing some well-known bugs, joined the battle of the Tiger Tank and other battles. The skin of the style tank is also the end of the first generation, with relatively good balance. Let's talk about mod. There are so many excellent mods for Company of Heroes 1. For example, Blitz is extremely comprehensive. The authors creative principle is to pursue authenticity. The current evaluation is the highest, and the playability is very high, but it is also ridiculed as a crispy warfare. Everyone has played and understood by themselves. Company of Heroes has joined the Soviet camp in the European battlefield. Many more are not listed here. If you are interested, you can check and download by yourself. In short, Company of Heroes 1 is a very good game. Online with friends, PY transaction... ",True,False

"Friends who like civilized + fantasy style strategy games should not miss it. Compared with the two recent fantasy 4X games, EL wins in excellent details and good micro-management management. Lets briefly introduce it with 4X elements as the classification: 1. Exploring (eXlore): Just like sending scouts to open maps at the beginning of Civilization 5, EL also needs to explore various relics, fight against the wild, and find various strategic resources and luxury goods. However, EL has added heroes, missions, and season settings, adding a lot of RPG features and playability to the game: (1) The beta version temporarily provides 4 races, each with its own unique heroes, divided into There are three types of long-range, melee, and support. Heroes of different races have different skill trees, but the development classification is very clear. They are divided into three parts: internal affairs, exploration, and combat, which can be selected and matched according to the player's strategic needs. At the same time, the game also provides a paper doll system for the hero, which can be equipped with various equipment from head to toe, but powerful equipment requires the support of different strategic resources and technology. The hero will not die, the defeat will appear in the war academy, you need to wait a long round before you can recruit again. (2) Each race has different main quests, and various random side quests will appear in the exploration. After completion, not only can you get various rewards, but you can also deepen your understanding of the ethnic background. (3) The game is divided into seasons. When winter comes, the output of food and money will be reduced. At the same time, the movement speed of the troops will be halved, and the vision will be reduced. Different seasons need to adopt different internal management and strategic goals. 2. Expansion (eXpand): The game map is divided into different administrative provinces. Each province can only be used by one race to build a city. This city will enjoy the bonus of the entire region's resources, which is to avoid the dense clusters of civilized AI While chaotic shop, it also emphasizes the importance of EL's exploration of strategic resources and timely expansion, which will also cause more tension in diplomatic relations. Although cities will get the strategic resources and luxury goods of the entire province, the location where each city is built is still very important, because the number of grids in each city is fixed at the beginning, and each grid produces food according to different terrains. Technology , Productivity, the sum of the output of these grids is your comprehensive national strength, so it is very important to build the city near special resources or wonders with happiness rewards. With the development of the city, you can build new districts and counties (select a grid to expand three new grids) to increase your national strength on the premise of reducing people's happiness. Different races have different terrain bonuses and perk. For example, wild walkers will increase productivity in forest terrain. Templar races dont need food at all, and cities need to be built on terrain with a lot of money. Similar to civilization, EL can also carry out detailed management of internal affairs. It can be set to automatically focus on food and a certain aspect of productivity, or it can manually manage every citizen. This is very important in the game. Every round, every season, and different era detailed management can play a key role in the overall strategy. 3. Development (eXploit): The beta version temporarily provides six eras of technology discs for each race. Although there are slight differences in technology between races, they are divided into four categories, internal affairs, military, technology and expansion. At least 10, you can unlock the technology of the next era. At the same time, EL also sets the important attribute of influence. After a certain round, players can use influence to set the overall development direction for the entire race (an empire strategic disc with many concentric circles), which is also the above four The direction, each layer of the ring needs to be unlocked in a different era, and the consumption of influence and the rewards obtained are also different. The strategy cannot be adjusted at any time, once it is decided that it takes a certain round to set it again. The attribute of influence can also be used for the fusion of the heroes conquered by the wilds. After the fusion, not only can you obtain special units, but you can also get bonuses to the characteristics of different tribes. Even diplomacy requires a lot of influence points, and the declaration of war and peace negotiations require public support. 4. Elimination (eXterminate): In EL, not only heroes can be upgraded, but various types of arms can also be upgraded. The battle is directly deployed on the big map after the two sides contact each other. Unlike Heroes, it does not need to switch screens. It has a strong sense of modernity and fluency. The battle tempo is very fast, and each round will automatically launch an attack after selecting the attack target and formation for each unit. In the absence of favorable terrain, fast melee units are the nemesis of long-range soldiers. Similarly, long-range units are also a nightmare for slow melee. With the unlocking of technology, new units will appear. It is reasonable to choose heroes with different units The key to victory in battle. Of course, players who focus on strategy can also choose to fight fast in three ways (attack type, defensive type, in-place type). The game's shortcomings: lack of shortcut key settings, racial characteristics are relatively small, and others are acceptable. The beta version is so fun, I look forward to the release of the official version! ",True,True

"Somewhere in the ""Kremlin dungeons"" some kind of dead people, archers and other monsters rose up so that there would be something .. Around there are poisonous fly agarics and hungry bats ... And we have to do something there .. Unfortunately, the game is not Russian, although the text is simple, but nevertheless. The game itself resembles 3D shooters from the early 90s. And it weighs accordingly - as much as 30 megabytes. You cannot jump, the camera cannot be raised up or down, it is fixed rigidly in one projection. Many objects in the game are not volumetric, but just a flat sprite / texture. I just remembered my childhood. Opponents are always turned towards you, stationary objects can be bypassed and seen from the side that this is a plane. Textures like 30x30 or so. Music sounds like midi. But pleasant by the way. True, the main menu has a completely modern looking picture and music, which is a little out of the ordinary picture. In similar games, I have PUBG and Assassin's Creed Origins hanging. Perhaps there is something in this. I would also add DOOM 2016. In general, if your computer does not pull them, then this game will definitely work for you. ",True,False

"Halcyon 6 is a 4X/Turnbased Strategy/Tactical RPG game with great elements but not delivering a longterm gameplay value. + Graphic design: Pixel art is good but not outstanding. Some parts even uninspiring. + UI: Well set, easy to understand. + Sound design: Even its repetitive, soundtrack is perfect. Goes amazingly well with the gameplay. Sound effects are below par. + Game mechanics: There's a lot going on there and they all connect with each other superbly. + Gameplay: For the first run, everything is new, suprising and addicting. (Second run... Forget about it, you have seen it all.) - Variety on game mechanics. Even it seems like the game deals and offers amount of mechanics to the player, when you inspect the parts on their own, they all crumble. For example; there are ships but variety and customization is very low, there's a tech tree but it is very limited, there are ground battles but every battle feels the same, there are factions but they have little to none impact on the run, there is a map but its the same thing sprinkled over everywhere. - Gets old fast. After the first run, i had no intention or desire to go back for a second. Actually, i did start a second run to see if theres a new element or a rogue-like mechanic is preset... and there is not. Quitted fast.  Halcyon 6 is not a bad game, its even very fun for the first run but it doesnt have the longevity you would expect from its genre.

Fortunately, the jump map has icons for each of them so you know if there are any in the area you are at, and the strategy guide itself also had a section that showed the location of each collectible in each scene. The music in the games was so peaceful...it truly was beautiful to listen to. There is also a journal that has a section for the current objective and also gives you more of the back story. I honestly don't usually pay too much attention to the stories in the games, but that wasn't the case with this game. I honestly was interested in the story and did read the journal pages. The graphics in the game were amazing! They were very well done and then when I started to play the bonus game, they were absolutely stunning! ",True,False

"The game so far 5 hours in has been a delight. my only complaint thus far was the weird setup at the beginning of the game were it was identifying the settings? That took awhile, but its been great since. The story is awesome, the audio and game play is great. it's running on ultra at or around 100 fps average and the animations are stunning. I really don't see what everyone is complaining about. It might be possible some people don't take good care of their machines? Idk, can't say. but I am having a blast.

"Yes, the Far Cry franchise is notorious for rehashing the same ideas and gameplay over and over again but... This *is* the best Far Cry game, hands down.   Short & sweet, about 10 hours of playtime.

"Counter Strike is a multiplayer shooter. In the game, you play on the side of terrorists and counter-terrorists. Terrorists must plant a bomb and defend it until it explodes or kill all opponents. Anti-terrorists must watch the so-called ""Bombistes"" where the bomb is planted (so far we have 2 bombits A and B.) or kill the remaining team. CS: GO is a game known all over the world. The best Polish team is Virtus.Pro, which took 1st place in the tournament in 2014. The game is very fun and addictive. The game was created by Valve Corporation and Hidden Path Entertainment. There are modes in the game such as: Arms Race (After killing you get better and better weapons. Only one person can win), Demolition (5 v 5 where you also get better and better weapons), Tournament (5 v 5 you play for rank, more on that later) , Simplified (10 v 10 the same as in the tournament, but not by rank). In this game, the skills alone will not help. You have to know hiding places, tactics, and grenades. In my opinion, it is best to play with your friends, because after 1. You have better communication, 2. You dominate the psyche 3. You can create more complex tactics than the so-called ""Rush b"". There are weapon skins, knives and gloves in the game. In my opinion, if it weren't for skins, the game wasn't that popular. Personally, I like them, but some of them can cost over PLN 2,000, which is a slight exaggeration. Of course, there will be those who collect them and are able to buy them. Time for maps. There are many maps in the game, but the most important and the most famous ones in the tournament field are: Dust II, Nuke, Cache, Mirage or Inferno. The maps are not extensive, but very good looking and done. This game can be played on a weak computer which attracts a lot of people. Earlier I mentioned ranks. A rank can only be earned in tournament mode. You get the first rank after 10 matches won and it is optional. There are 18 ranks in total. Silver is for beginners: Silver I, Silver II, Silver III, Silver IV, Silver Elite, Silver Elite Master. The Golden Laurel can also be said for beginners: Gold Nova I, Gold Nova II, Gold Nova III and Gold Nova Master. Master Guardian are ranks for mid-level players: Master Guardian I. Master Guardian II, Master Guardian Elite and Distinguished Master Guardian. Legendary Eagles are ranks with a higher skill level: Legendary Eagle and Legendary Eagle Master. The two highest and the last ones are for the best players: Supreme First Class and Global Elite - the highest rank that can be achieved in CS: GO. Summary: If you like 1-man shooters, well-made maps, skins and tactics then this is the game for you. The game costs 13 Euro (Polish approximately 50 PLN). Thanks a lot for reading the review. I hope you liked it. ",True,False

"The Edgar Mitchel Overview Effect VR Experience by Immersive VR Education and the Institute of Noetic Sciences is a great short film in which we fly back to earth from the dark side of the moon and at the same time this film is intended to bring the viewer closer to the so-called overview effect. This program was originally shown to around 100 test persons who either lay in a salty ""flotation bath"" in a wellness facility so that the buoyancy in the pool can convey the feeling of weightlessness, or they experienced the experience as soft as butter in a bed. Now we can approach the overview effect comfortably in the armchair or lying in bed or on the couch at home. So it's about seeing the big picture, recognizing what needs to be done and finding solutions and this experience should at least trigger an aha moment if it goes well. The Edgar Michell Overview Effect VR Experience naturally offers excellent images of space and authentic audio material from the 14th Apollo mission. Edgar Mitchell himself speaks to the passive viewer and explains his views on the overview effect and how it affected him. And why he absolutely wanted that all people - especially politicians - should experience this experience. With the Edgar Mitchell Overview Effect VR Experience this can work a little, I think and Edgar Mitchell would certainly be happy with the result. R.I.P. Edgar Mitchell. An absolutely great experience! Everyone who has a comfortable chair and wants to find out something about the big picture should travel here. more abstract reviews,  my curator page and thumbs up, if you at least felt the aha moment.

"Well, this is a take from someone who doesn't shy away from old games, even though I was still a little brat when this game came out. After investing 100 hours into the game, I can finally say that I'm ready to highlight some pros and cons. Pros: Cons: Overall, this game is a relic of the past even in its Enhanced rendition. I've played a fair share of the late 80s and early 90s games (Wizardry, M&M, Gold Box, and SSI games) so putting up with bad UI and other problems doesn't bother me too much, I can still enjoy the old-school experience, and that's why I won't leave a negative review. Would I ever consider recommending this game to my peers or friends? Definitely not. Honestly speaking, you can skip this one and go straight to Baldur's Gate II. That one is better in pretty much every aspect, albeit is more restrictive when it comes to world exploration. But that's for the best. ",True,False

The game is worth buying for the sake of multiplayer, which is very interesting to play with friends. But here you have to buy kits with West Germans, Anglopedikami and allies. The starting sides (USSR and Germany) are very weak and can only fight calmly with each other. The most annoying thing is the need to microcontrol the units, by themselves they just stand and ... that's it.

"As of now, regarding the genre of Tower Defense, this very game may be the ultimate rendition. Thus said I haven't played the later games in the series yet, so these may be even better - apart from featuring sometimes questionable changes in graphics style in the follow ups - but that surely depends on your own individual taste of course. What we got here is BY FAR the best balanced yet challenging one of it's kind. Furthermore all that gameplay goodness is wrapped up in absolutely tastefull graphics, totally athmospheric music plus fantastically punchy and rewarding sound effects topped off by state of the art and straight to the point funny and timeless voice acting.

"So, today I will review one of the games that is part of the series of legendary racing games of the last decade, standing on the same level of popularity with the series, and being one of the founders of the A bit of history genre. , developed by a Finnish company, is an improved version of the second part, created specifically for consoles. In addition to resolution and slightly improved graphics, new challenges and new opponents have also been added to it. For me personally, it is this part, and not the others, that is truly iconic. Beloved by me since childhood and replayable to this day - in my entire life I spent a lot of time in it, and now it's time to buy it, and after going through it for the hundredth time I was sure that I would write this text. Now for the gameplay. The highlight of this series was the very authentic and fun destructibility of everything, but at the same time it did not reduce the entire gameplay to a car simulator. You don't have to be the first to win the race. It is enough to make sure that other racers do not do this, namely, to effectively destroy all 11 bodies that ride with you on this track (about all the participants a little later). The best way is not to drive carefully on the road, but to go ahead, knocking everything and everything in your path and never put on the brakes. All this fun will be accompanied by an explosive soundtrack written by the ambitious bands of Foggy Albion (this whole playlist is still in my player and has been on frequent listening for 8 years already), as well as very decent graphics and physics. All cars are divided into three classes (and one bonus - cars with rocket boosters, created for special tests): The whole career is the passage of the corresponding cups on the corresponding class of cars. You go through the race, get credits for it, and spend them on buying and improving the vehicle. It's the same song with the drivers. In total, in addition to the player himself, there are 11 characters and each of them is not a faceless rider, but a well-defined racer with his own character. For example, Frank Malkov loves big and hardy cars - jeeps and pickups. Jack Benton and Lee Bing are typical leaders. They are always somewhere in the first positions. There is no motivation and plot as such. These are just vigorous races accompanied by brutal music and bright explosions. Now, let's take a direct look at the pros and cons that will replace the overall estimates and numbers. :: ",True,False

"It's a pretty good puzzle-y rogue-like where you pick strategic bonuses to build your character defensively and offensively and need to carefully plan your next step around the placement and damage capabilities of each type of enemy on the field. I think it's fun and makes you think, and is great for shorter sittings. I would recommend it at the asking price! That said, I've played like a billion rounds of Hoplite, the Android game this is inspired by, and I do prefer that over this. Hoplite is really hard, and often frustrating, which this is not. I think that's not a bad thing, but neither do I feel like it's really an improvement over the original. This game adds some more offensive skills (more ranged options, most significantly) and you can pick from the full list of special bonuses at the successful completion of every level instead of a random, limited list of choices like in Hoplite. That's nice because your build isn't as subject to RNG, but it makes the game feel less difficult (so the ""puzzle""/""strategy"" aspect is a little less satisfying), and some of the bonuses are clearly overpowered and more useful than others. I think the graphics here don't look very polished; I greatly prefer Hoplite's pixel graphics. I would also like to be able to turn off the persistent blood spatter. It's a super tiny game (only 67 MB!), but feels ever so slightly sluggish on my 5-year-old laptop. That actually turned me off the game a bit, but I tried it on my desktop before writing this review and the movement feels acceptably crisp and smooth. There are a few things I actually don't like about this game. One is the inability to make the window a) smaller and b) portrait instead of landscape. As a game inspired by a mobile game and that uses simple graphics, it doesn't need to be such a big window. I'd love to play this while watching a movie on the other half of the screen. The second is that 23 levels is too long for one ""round"". There are too many same-y early levels with the first two types of monster before a third one starts appearing. You get good at killing them/avoiding damage after you survive a few levels and pick up a couple bonuses. The third is that you're punished for not killing everything on the level, which doesn't make sense since your end goal is just to get to the bottom and kill the boss. You shouldn't lose XP for finding a way to escape without wasting time killing everything. ",True,False

The spirit of Solgrin's games is to suffer. Whatever difficulty you choose, you suffer. The difficulty only determines how much you suffer. You suffer, passing one test, in order to suffer even more later, because further surprises await you even worse.

"For quite a long time, I could not muster the strength to express my opinion about this creation from Dontnod Entertainment. But what is really there, I played the game for a year and a half, so probably everything is natural. But more to the point. After a great first part and an interesting story about a teenage girl Max, who knew how to manage time, which diluted the sticky gameplay quite well, I expected from the continuation at least repetition and development of existing ideas. Alas, the second part is not about that. The second part is a completely different game, with its main characters. There is no continuation of the question, although a couple of references can be found with a careful study of the environment during the game. In the story, we will play for two brothers, or rather for one of them - the elder Sean. The beginning is calm and measured, we are introduced to the main characters, a little show of life before the events that led to the escape of the brothers from home and their pursuit by the police. The plot is quite original, the first dull hour of the game finally gives way to decisive actions and it seems that now everything will start. The boys run headlong, hiding from the cops, cross several states, meet new friends and enemies. And again a significant ""but"" appears here. The thought of the authors is caught immediately. An attempt to show the player the relationship between the elder and the younger brother, clumsily pressing on pity. Unfortunately, everything is done rather sadly. The gameplay is corny boring. And if the first episode intrigued the plot and it was interesting to see further development, then by the middle of the third I was already yawning and thinking, well, when is the denouement. Frankly passing fourth episode drove me into melancholy and realization that I was disappointed in this project. Well, I think the final episode is a complete failure, with the exception of the last 10 minutes, which also raise a lot of questions that remain unanswered. As in the first part, they decided to please us with the special skills of the main characters. The younger brother has a unique ability of telekinesis, thanks to which he is able to move objects and around which most important events develop. But we play for the older brother and can only tell Daniel (the youngest) what to do, we are not allowed to indulge in force, as in the first part, and from this the visibility of everything that happens presses even more. Instructions to the younger brother usually do not lead to anything, he will still do as planned by the plot, and often these are just ridiculous actions that defy common sense. It is clear that Daniel is still a child, but so much selfishness, recklessness and aggression cannot be concentrated in one person. It is corny that you dont believe in everything that happens, but you dont get into your younger brother, on the contrary, you want to get rid of him as soon as possible. Of course, there were some interesting solutions. For example, at the beginning of each episode, we are briefly told about the events of the previous parts in the format of sketches, and the brothers act there in the form of wolf cubs. And they themselves often repeat that they are like wolves. It sounds silly, but it is written in an original way and arouses interest. During our trip, we will visit many locations that can truly amaze with their beauty and attention to detail. From a visual point of view, everything is very good here. The gameplay itself is standard for projects of this kind. We walk a lot, explore our surroundings, talk, and occasionally make ""important"" decisions. By the way, they can influence the ending, but not dramatically. Most of the characters that we meet along the way cause only rejection and negativity. Unfortunately, all worthy ideas and developments were ineptly implemented. That is why the game, closer to the middle, simply rolls into a dull thing and continues to fall down until the final scene. On the other hand, it is still an interesting road adventure with unexpected plot twists (predictable, but still) and a high-quality picture. I cannot say that the game is not worthy of your attention, very few projects of this kind have been released recently, and even less often they tell us at least some original story. The only thing I want to note once again for those who were delighted with the first part - do not expect something like this in the second, this is a completely different game and story. -High-quality visual design, beautiful landscapes, a variety of locations -The plot, despite the protractedness and illogicality of many decisions -An abundance of small details -Gorgeous musical accompaniment -The ability to feel like a hero of a real road adventure -Dull and drawn-out gameplay -Most of the characters are completely undiscovered and cause dislike -Totalness of many dialogues -Uniformity Gameplay: 5/10 Grafon: 8/10 Plot: 7/10 Music: 9/10 - - in some places an interesting story. Unfortunately, the need to stretch the game over 5 episodes did the trick. The second half of your adventure will be bored. Alas, there are few alternatives, so you can get acquainted with the project at a discount. ",True,False

"Ohh god, this is a long-standing sequel to Metro 2033. As a big fan of both parts and a lover of apocalyptic games, I really love the metro. And what was that tax? And exactly. So after the bad ending ""metro 2033"" we continue to play for our beloved Artyom after he sent the missiles to the black lair and after we found d6. We were kind of accepted in ""SPARTA""? : D The game is very atmospheric. The atmosphere of the destroyed city ""Moscow"", the crashed plane in which some, let's say, oddity lives. Pavel, Khan, Anna and other characters were just that these dialogues were very well worked out, an interesting plot. Well, this is not ""Vladimirsky Central"" from Metro 2033. Drawings, pictures, graphics - Creators of S.T.A.L.K.E.R - EVEN HAVE BEEN SERVED! On the creators of the Metro Games Series, on the other hand, the graphics were very similar to the stalker itself. They sued to steal the original engine. The game's sequel isn't much different from the original. The plot is the same, the weapons are the same, locations and everything else ... well, you get the idea. The graphics have certainly become better, but the original was released not so long ago, so the contrast is not so painful for the eyes. But my rogue friends are most indignant about the game - the game costs a whole 900 rubles for both reworked parts. And so the game is great. The plot, the atmosphere, many different opponents (both mutants and people). Quite a lot of locations, but most of all I liked it after completing the game additional tasks. In them you can find out why you were taken prisoner by ""Reich"", what happened to Pavel after your escape, Ulman, Khan, Khan's home station - it's all very interesting. Take your time for this game. It will pay off your time. And so the verdict: the game is 9.5 / 10. ",True,False

"Saints Row 3 ... Let's say that you can define yourself as a gamer only if you own or at least have played one of the 4 masterpieces of the Volition. In my opinion the game offers all those dynamics (not just fooling around) that GTA has never offered us, with a fairly varied gameplay, an engaging and overall well-structured plot. The game itself is very long-lived and has a fairly ""standalone"" storyline, ie it does not require the knowledge that would be provided by playing the other three titles. From a technical point of view it is very solid, with pretty good graphics and a well-done optimization. It runs on almost all machines, even the oldest. If I had to rate the work done by the volition I would say ... 8.5 / 10 considering the small and occasional bugs. ~ Trane_LoneWolf ~ [ITA] ",True,False

"Considering I've always been a dedicated naruto fan and considering it as a memento that's a part of my childhood. I bought the bundle pack, so as for Storm 4, in particular. I would say in terms of its grandeur of battling I'm just left for words, speechless as that being the suiting descriptor it's just on a whole different grand scale. An echelon of high tier badassery if you ask me. The action and battle scenes are the best I've seen out of this game comparing it to the previous storm titles. Now in terms of narration and storyline (adventuring), it may be formatted differently, and brief, the antithesis sort of to the previous storm titles but, I still sobbed and yet couldn't have been more attached to it. And that's not to say the inclusion being that we also have the dlcs (Boruto expansion and the Ostusuki characters, Momo and Kin) (Adult Sasuke is badass naruto too). I know I'm pretty late on this and also I've finished the series too a while ago but, this is an all-out amazing game but, of course, long it has been obsolete considering not that many players are playing it since the game is kind of old.

"The first Evil Within was, when all is said and done, a mish-mash of just about every ""survival horror"" cliche under the sun. The game had no compunctions, whatsoever, about proudly flying the influence of every major horror game released since the early Resident Evils and Silent Hills...all the way up to the latest-and-greatest released in the twenty-odd years since, such as Outlast and The Last of Us. It got away with such brazen plagiarism for one reason and one reason alone: it was good. Real good. Probably as good as the best games which helped spawn it, and better than all the rest. Anyone who enjoyed that first instalment should be pleased to hear that not that much has changed for the sophomore outing. I mean, sure, no one should be surprised to hear that everything's a wee bit ""bigger"" this time around. More action, more gore, more stealth, more weapons, more crafting, more ""open world""-ish elements, and two - count 'em, TWO - different types of safe/save rooms. We all expected this. The good news is that they haven't gone apewith any of it, and the basic charms of the original game remain intact. It's much the same thing, with just a few more mechanics and options, and an ever-so-slightly darker (and, arguably, superior) storyline.  Heck, I was happy. Extremely happy. As I'm sure most fans of the first will be. Clearly one of the best horror games of the year, in a very, VERY good year for such things. ",True,False

"I've really loved Destiny since the first game came out and I do still love the series. Since the move to Steam I've found the game to still be enjoyable but with constant crashing on the friends & chat app from steam it's exhausting to try to play with friends. Aside from this, like the original, the game still has it's problems. At the time of writing this review we are witnessing the final days of The Guardian Games. Bungie has shown with this event that they are not even really sure how to properly balance the game so everyone can have fun by nerfing Hunters way more than they should've and literally giving Titans the upper hand during the whole event. There are broken bounties in which you have to do what it says hundreds of times before it actually registers and the whole event being based around bounties is kind of dissapointing. Season 10 is the first season where I've really sat down to play this game and aside from lore and other bits it's been partially boring. I feel like the game can really only be enjoyed if you have a fireteam to run activities with and all the DLC's bought. Another problem that this game legitimately has is the ""skill based matchmaking"". Half the time I feel like my whole team is braindead while the other team is a full clan that's been playing the game since it came out and it ruins the fun aspects of PvP. Aside form all of that I'd still recommend the game. Every game has its flaws and this game sure has a lot of them but it's still playable and very fun even if you're playing alone ",True,False

Sounds here are just terrifying, It's a mix of horror and mystery but it's always a mystery pulling you through, it's hard not to sink into this game. It's a very enjoyable experience, gimmick with regenration is something I haven't seen often. And SWERY65 made sure to not use it to much unless you like screams of agony. This title is good at showing you pain. Beat me up, but most of his games are very detailed in unexpected stuff if you ever seen Deadly Premonitions or D4, you will know his ropes around characters and world creations. And he is very wild with his works and imagination. It's also visible here. His works are very distinguishing. Plenty of ideas were implemented to keep the gimmick and story interesting including phone calls and SMS, even if some sections were a bit annoying with checkpoints / riddles. Repeating some sections was not fun... but (!!!) going in deeper the ending was worth it. I really liked this interpretation and closure.

"When I played Neils Weekly Objectives, I didnt watch any strategy videos. I did few missions and I hated 9S. I felt 9S nagging, especially hate. I didnt do much of the side missions and didnt do much. Impression (English scum), when the main line is going on, I feel that the plot is not particularly tragic, but a bit pleasant (BGM). When Adam and Eve played, the impression was very deep. I felt that the two people fit the image of Long Aotian in my heart. Handsome and cool skills! When Eve died, he said a word, the impression was very deep, death is so cold, (I am a bit depressed), at that time, I began to think, could it be that Eve himself came to die, and didnt want to kill 9S at all, just using 9S continuously stimulates 2B, making 2B's heart shake or become stronger. Pascal, Emiru, and Devola/Popola were very impressed, and I discussed them in detail for three weeks. Finally, when BOOS Adam played, he kept repeating, Nissan, why did you leave me (gay guy), maybe this is my brother control! At the second week of the week, because I took into account the side missions, I applied a Chinese patch. At the beginning of the second week, I made a plan, props and tasks for myself. If I can do it, do it quickly, and drag the main line first. , Prioritize the branch line,, When playing 9S, I was tortured to death (invasion to hide the barrage), I was a handicapped party, I once considered not to invade, just rely on basic attacks to kill monsters (unrealistic), when playing 9S , Im more tired than when I played 2B. I kept reading files. When observing the plot from the perspective of 9S, you found that 9S and 2Bs inner thoughts are quite different. 9Ss inner hope is that I have been completing tasks with 2B, even if Reincarnation doesnt matter. He hopes for the company of others. He has always been lonely. No one has ever walked into his inner world. When Eve took 9S, and when 9S repaired his body, Eve said a classic thing. , To describe 9S: Dont you want 2B! 9S was silent, and kept crying in his heart, who would help me. When he invaded Adam, Adam said, in fact, I just want to stay with my brother. A young lady who came from the beginning just to take care of 9S was afraid of hurting 9S, and hoped that 9S would not know the truth of the whole world, let 9S always complete its own tasks, repeat the cycle slowly, and tell 2A when she is about to lose control, 9S is left to you. The truth has been concealed from 9S (I am actually a 2E model). From dislike to obsessive character, at the end of the 3 weeks, the favorite character changes from 2B to 2A, to 9S, 9S can be regarded as the protagonist, 9S is the real flesh and blood character, because when you start from one week When you observe the 3-week objective, you find that 9S has undergone a huge change in personality. At first he was lively, innocent, and had good ideas for the future (when the war is over, go shopping with 2B), and then change He has to be calm and sensible, and at the same time from the initial incomprehension to the hatred of the mechanical lifeforms (in fact, he knows best that there is nothing wrong with the mechanical lifeforms. At that time, 2B died and he could not accept it. He had to transform his goal of living into Revenge for mechanical life forms, a kind of blackening), the most 9S description has ended in one sentence, 2B, it turns out that you have been there all the time. A character that is close to invincibility, the front is tough. When you run away with blood sucking chips and iron rods and wooden sticks at full level, there are no monsters, even BOOS, and you cant hold on to 3S in 3S. ,just. 2A just wants to end all reincarnation, and has no interest in this world anymore. When all reincarnation is completed, he will return to his original partner. The character with a miserable ending in this game feels that everything is going in a direction that he does not want. All the villagers in the village have been killed. Even the children that I have always wanted to protect have ended up killing each other. I really regret it. They were afraid. I originally wanted them to know the fear and stay away from the village to reduce their harm. In the end, they were overwhelmed by fear and committed suicide. 2A, please, choose to kill me or delete my amnesia. I cant stand this tragic reality. Whenever I close my eyes, I see the scene of children killing each other. I chose memory. Delete (Grandpa Pascal, play with us more """""""") In order to repay your sins and live in self-blame all your life, you did it! You also succeeded! Take a good rest!

Good - recommend 4/5 ready to learn a lot in game, get some help It's a love and hate relationship with Rust for me, this is the first kind of game with survival and suff I played . I had no pc when Rust was a thing early days, As soon I bought my pc I bought this game. One thing about rust is you must have someone to play along with. You can try solo if you really love the game(cause it will be hard, you will eventually learn to play better in solo) I have lost hours of work to someone cause of my poor aim or I got greedy to loot.

The graphics are more detailed, the location much more interesting and in the story I was fascinated by the sexy Succuba, a demon of passion from hot hells. Unlike number one, I was not bored. However, it is necessary to point out one problem when searching for hidden objects - some objects need to be clicked multiple times. It's such a small glitch, but I'm used to it. Another inconvenience is the infernally difficult rotating puzzle in the bonus chapter, with which you will have to worry for maybe a few hours and then give it up. :-D I have marked the solution, so you can contact me.

"(Full review follows below) 	  is a very soulful game. Thats probably its most defining feature.  It's in the style of an isometric hack-and-slash, drawing from arcade roots and presented with a poignant atmosphere.  It is definitely a very easy game to enjoy; and it should appeal to wide variety of gamers.  And since it is medium length and has a wide range of difficulty options, it is a good game for anyone who may want to take a step out of their comfort zone and try something different. Probably the first thing that jumps out about   is the gorgeous, hand-painted artwork. But that only scratches the surface.  The whole atmosphere of this game is incredible.  The world literally unfolds around you as you make your way through the environments. The soundscape is spot on and the music is great. It is a very aesthetic experience. The gameplay is strongly narrative-based.  In fact, there is an actual narrator that guides you through the game.  This nature of the game does lead it to be semi-linear, although you do have a fair amount of branching options to work with in some aspects of the game. The gameplay is pretty simple and intuitive, but also offers a surprising amount of depth.  There is a decent variety to your arsenal and to the enemies you face.  And the baseline difficulty is very easy, which is the proper way to design games so that everyone can enjoy them.  Nevertheless, the innovative difficulty system in the game allows you to tweak various specific options (enemy health, enemy damage, player movement, etc.) to meet your preference and tackle the most extreme challenges/achievements. Now the game isnt really that long if you were to only do a single playthrough of the campaign. However, there are the aforementioned challenges and achievements to tackle, a  , and also an   where you get a running score throughout your playthrough and can compete on leaderboards, if that is your thing.  So you should be able to get a good amount of playtime. So, in summary, I would say that the synergy of the soulful presentation, the intuitive gameplay, and the unique narration makes this game more charming than a Disney prince.    is a great gaming experience, and a modern classic.  Unless you are adamantly not interested in this genre, I recommend you at least consider giving it a shot. ",True,False

The game is often on sale during the sales (therefore buyable between 5 and 10 ), and is playable in multi-player thanks to Steam (and it is an excellent multi-player). It is both accessible to everyone and finishable in a few tens of hours, and terribly difficult (the base game is not so hard, but mods make it possible to make the game more complex and extend the life of the game).

"But my biggest question now is, is this game really a global battle? When the game just came out, people can be matched in an average of 1 minute. (All national TC) Don't guess here that I haven't changed any regional languages, I have tried them all. When there are a lot of people, more than 18,000 people are playing games. Searching for self-built houses can only find a few, and they are all Chinese. It stands to reason not to mention the United States, Japan and South Korea play a lot, right? But none of them can be searched, and none of them can be matched. If the search results of the country matching are all the same country, the matches in the E area are all Chinese players in the E area. I bought the global Why is the version still unable to find people, or all of them are TC (City Dynasty). When I really searched for a self-built house, there were only a few rooms, leaving a large blank space too shivering. In my imagination, the match should not be fast. There are dozens of self-built houses, and it is also global. I don't know if I am the only person with this problem, or if many people have the same problem with me. It's like I bought a stand-alone version of Tekken, which feels weird. ================================================= =============== ================================== =============================== 1. Iron Fist's series of blows feel nothing like, first class. 2. The screen, the details are really good, and when you look closely, you will sweat and stick to dust.

"The game finally came out of early access in August and the first 2 episodes of the story mode, which will total 5 episodes, have been released. The story mode is satisfactory but repeats itself after a point. Now you keep repeating the same things to gain the trust of each different character. I can count this as the negative feature of the game. The atmosphere will immerse you, whether you play the story mode or the sandbox mode. As you have just survived a snowy storm and threw yourself into a warm shelter, you will get up and put yourself tea / coffee simultaneously with the game, you will feel cold at the computer and want to light the stove. Especially at night, both the outside sky and the stars are perfect, and if you have a stove inside, the shadows reflected on the walls from the openings of the stove are perfect. It reminded me of the house with a stove in my childhood. The lights coming out of the stove cast shadows on the wall, I would watch those shadows for hours. This game gave me exactly the same feelings years later. Absolutely play. Positive sides - Especially the soundtrack in the sandbox mode is great - The atmosphere is amazing - The map designs are very nice - It receives constant updates. New items, creatures, mechanics are added. Negative Sides - Repetition after a point. (Actually it doesn't pose a huge problem) - Some items to add are missing.

The soundtrack with drum makes battles even with A.I. pretty epic. The gameplay is based on handball kind of game, with deathmatch build in. U catch the ball, u throw the ball, while trying to survive or eliminate all who will try to destroy you. I tried only 1 vs 1, so can't say for other modes. What I did like is the various abilities, for example u can use shields, shoot or supercharge ur laser cannon and perform a 1 hit k.o. to ur enemy.

This game to me was ""Icing on cake"".  When it comes to harsh survival situations, resource management and fast paced hand-to-hand combat, this game ticks all boxes.  This game also involves personal strategies when it comes to kill Zombies/mutations: Do I attack the group of mobs head on? Or attack them from a distant with explosives and firearms. The storyline is interesting to say the least, when it comes to crazed tribe men to rich military bastards, you can't help but have an envy to kill them and get off the god forsaken island.  I would highly recommend this game to anyone that can swallow high levels of gore and get entertained as much as I do from heads and body parts flying and staining a beautiful but deadly beach.  SCREAMER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ",True,False
"Thank you again for the royal fit. Without you, these reviews would not exist. In I talked about big ambition, a new format, a scenario that forces the player into the position of a character in order to combine suffering and overcoming. How could a sequel to this experiment come out? Quite entertaining, I ask you to say ... from a general point of view, it is an excellent sequel and a real gift for people like me. ROTTR fixes all the flaws of the original (whenever possible) and is a larger game. To summarize ... I really liked the game. Of course, I did not stay in it long enough, but it is still worthy of your attention. It requires concentration, patience, a desire to explore and poke around in every corner, and in return gives you a good plot with twists, good characters with character development, an epic conflict in a new setting, and new mechanics for interacting with the world and the main character. How can you do it? ... 8.5 Sick immortal warriors / 10 ",True,False

"Note: The review is spoiler-free, written based on keyboard and singleplayer gameplay. Table below for quick check, scroll down further for detailed pros and cons. :) Whoa ho ho! Cuphead.. I picked up this game the moment when I heard that it feels just like the classic Contra run-n-gun shooting. But in perfect 1930's Disney cartoon style!! Where else can you ever find another like this?!  So here I go, became cuphead boy dressed in red (or mugman in blue if you play local co-op with your partner), shooting magical droplets out of my bare fingertip, bashing in an ""Alice in Wonderland"" style cruel little damned island. I used to stay up all night beating Contra with my dad when I just started primary school, this game for what it is, went immediately into my collection.  Where should I even start?! For a game developing team that's made of 3 people, after 3 years of development, they've really made sure that almost every aspect of the game, for its own genre, is done  .  Here's something I almost forgot to mention: For every game section in Cuphead, there are   difficulty settings for you to choose from:   and  . By default, the game will always run on the Regular difficulty unless you select Simple otherwise. Simple mode excludes your ability to fight certain bosses whom you can access in Regular mode. So it's completely up to the player which difficulty they want to beat the game on..  For such quality of art design, character design and battle design, if you enjoy dying your way to perfection, this game is for you. You're prolly gonna die a lot, but if you don't mind such means to achieve faster reflex and having sense of great achievement in having perfect runs (even with your partner!), then go grab this game NOW.

"Finally overed almost all game of 2012.. but this one was due. couldnt play this at that time. Swear,this game really another amazing game from UBIsofT just before it becomes trash. Very nice post apocalipse game. U have to decide , find shortcut routes, same time find ur family. The game is nearly 6hours played and overd.Really loved it.Loved the character quickly.Realisticity well maintained. Found no glitches or bugs. but two times game crashed.Still this game is well playbale . not like stupid Ghost recon future Soldire which is cant be played cos of continuos Crashes. Graphics is Fine.Gameplay is Fine too .Overally really a great expereince. its like almost sad at the end. The name really goes with the game. Ubisoft should really make a next one.

"I've tried all of the pubg and its clones so far. There is only one thing I can say, this was the most refined gameplay among them. Even the broken vault mechanics in pubg can't work smart, this game is officially running like oil. weapon parts are automatically installed. This saved him from labor. If we want to replace it with another part, we only install it manually. Choosing where to start on the map directly saves 10 minutes. Like Pubg for 10 minutes, let the folks connect, fall with a parachute, die after 2 minutes. Starting a new game does not tire you. After a house or two, you collect enough loot to compete with the worst others. The wing suit, skateboard and zipline mechanics work great and seriously gives you an advantage if you start the game at the right spots on the map. the feeling of hitting is not bad. If we compare it with the pubg, it is a bit more arcade. The biggest minus of the game is the helicopter issue. If you want to win the game, it seems more advantageous to go to the helicopter area and run without haze. I managed to get on once and that game didn't shoot a bullet. When I went from places that wouldn't be seen in mountains and hills and when the helicopter came, I ran and climbed whatever God gave and I won the game. The bullet tracks are very good for players like me who cannot travel a long distance. You can see the bullet drop and better predict where to shoot. Although the system requirements are not as high as Pubg, he still wants a good computer. as I understand it, a good processor makes things a lot easier. In short, although my system is quite good (gtx1060 6gb), this game has managed to fill my body, tired of fps drops and general clumsiness in pubg, with the excitement of battle royal. I hope they will work harder on it and cheer up the environment with a couple of map extensions. very successful. The game turned out much better than I expected. (syozkn) moreover it's free .... The game has a nice snow map and the playground is closed due to a blizzard. When the time given before the game area is closed, we are directly in the blizzard, but compared to other Battle Royale games, this time is quite sufficient. In order to understand that you have attached a bullet to your opponent, for example, if you have played Battlefield before, there is a ""Hit indicator"", that is, a hit indicator. Weapon attachments are automatically added to the weapons and for example, when you switch to a different weapon of the same type, all the attachments of the weapon you have are replaced with the new weapon you have bought. The loot system of the game is quite good, you can easily find your health packs, weapons and armor. You can have 3 weapons at the same time. You will see the map at the beginning of the game and you will see the place other players have chosen to land. You will choose the place you want to land on the map yourself. A helicopter will come in the last closed area of the game and you will have to get on this helicopter to win. Whether you are the last person left or 10 more in the game, you will win the game the moment you manage to get on the helicopter. ",True,False

"This game is AMAZING!!!!!!! But the community is trash. If you want to play the story, you'll have a great time. Getting on online is a different story. People will go out of thier way just to mess with you, and when you call them out on it they just say your being ""salty"". Don't get me wrong though, its an awesome game.  Did I mention the modders? Oh these guys are the best. They do things like Fly, be invisible, spawn objects. But even better, they can give you in game money, that can get your account banned. Rockstar did an awesome job making an entire gaming community into huge a$$holes. No one cares about helping each other out, its just shoot and get angry that people shoot you back. All in all I would love this game if the people who played it took two seconds to think. Maybe that guy spent a lot of time getting those supplies, I should leave him to his buisness. Or better yet lend a hand, maybe make a friend. But no, this game is every man/woman to themselfs and if you can make someone else day worse than yours, you win. ",True,False

"This game is really a love letter. Many people may think of a romance reading this sentence but I don't mean to say it in that way, or maybe I do, who cares. What's this and why does it look so strange? Why would a buy a game about a sloth with Trump's hair and a guy with big tumours in his head? That's what I've come to answer! First of all I want to start talking about why I said this game is a love letter. Many of you, grew up with the point and click adventure games (most of this people can't count their age with their fingers of the hands and feet together), and well, there goes the love letter part of this game. You can find tributes to some of the most popular games of this style like Day of the Tentacle, Grim Fandango, and even the Neverhood! As those games playstyle, this point & clicker emulates them. You can Use, Talk to or Pick Up all the things you have at your disposal, or at least try to :) . You have your inventory where you can try to do your must stupid item mixes your mind asks you to do, and you can not advance until the  ass puzzle is solved (except the last one, which has a #### stupid method to skip it, lol). We're running late and have to answer the last question, why is it worth it to buy a so strange looking game with this weird characters telling me I will feel awkward playing this? That's an easy question to answer! As another effect from the blast from the past you can feel, this game has awesome humour that will make your burst out laughing at how stupidly it is sometimes, all the characters have a high degree of charm that will make you miss them when you finish. Aside from that, you have a superb voice acting very well done that gives some cool aesthetic to this hilarious characters that gives them the right touch of flavour to make this an even greater game. Even if it's based on some of this oldschool adventure games, you will see that this game is not as long as those, and you can finish it in less than 10 hours, which can be different depending on you capacity to solve puzzles. If there's a part that you don't know what to do, or you have returned to play from a few weeks of hard work you can just go and that's your tumor (that's why people have one, right? Really, you can do that!) even though the game is very easy and simple in the puzzle section, Hope you enjoy the game, and as cheap as it is, I don't think it wouldn't be worth it! ",True,False

"""Death End: Trial of Reincarnation 2"" is published by Landmine Club and is the second work of ""End Death: Reincarnation Trial"". The fly in the ointment is that this time the landmine agency also raised the national price to 199 yuan against the demeanor of the most conscientious day factory in the country (but as long as the discount is as usual, it will be a problem of more than ten yuan in the end. jpg). In addition, the game also adheres to the tradition of the mine club, providing krypton gold weapons that directly break the opening game experience (I don't recommend using it for the opening experience, the game is directly without difficulty after use, and the game is automatically finished). The game is considered to be a fusion of certain AVG elements. Every day in the game is divided into day and night. During the day, players can talk to the girls to investigate or learn more about them. The fighting part and plot promotion in the game are concentrated in the dark night-to be precise, after 12 o'clock. The UI and art also reflect the dark part of the plot. The initial interface will flash with dark shadows, and the UI adopts the dark (referring to the plot or art style, non-game play), the medieval slightly metallic UI commonly used in games. And the game's cutscene directly impresses players with bloody handprints that constantly appear. The plot style of the game is somewhat different from the usual style of Landmine Club, full of black and deep elements. If you want to relax in your free time, I would recommend other games from Landmine Club. The game begins with the heroine Dongshan Dance being abused by her father, and after finding the opportunity, the game officially enters the subject with a scream from her father. Wu was sent to the orphanage because she was found not guilty of justified defense, but all this has just begun. The girl who bullied Wu was killed at night (and Wu believed that she killed the girl), but the administrator told the girls that she was adopted. (The initial plot of the game, so I dont think its a spoiler) Landmine Club has always been able to explore the strange RPG gameplay. Although the battle of ""Death Endgame Trials 2"" takes place in a more conventional circular area ( Depending on the situation, there will be different sizes), but the existence of the ""knock fly bug"" makes the game change from a regular RPG to a pinball game. In the game, the player can enter up to 3 commands for one action. During the battle, the player can trigger the knock-to-fly BUG through 3 attacks or use the skill with knock-to-fly effect. After the trigger is triggered, the monster will fly out like a pinball and touch When you hit the wall, monsters and characters bounce back, and when you hit a monster, it will also drive the monsters to fly together. The game also introduces a weight system. It is not only difficult for heavy monsters to accumulate fly bars and the distance they fly is very limited. Players can increase or decrease the weight of monsters by some means. In the battle, there will be various colored circles in the center of the field. If you control the character to touch the circle, you will not only get BUFF but also accumulate ""pollution value"". Attacks will also accumulate during battle. Once the pollution value reaches 80% or more, the character will enter the plug Form, the character has new skills to use in the external form. It is also worth mentioning that hitting the circle with the knocking monster will also increase the BUFF to the character but will not increase the pollution value of the game. In terms of scene exploration, each character has different abilities. For example, Wu can control the PC to view hidden channels. Rorty can overcome obstacles. With the development of the plot, even the same scene will appear new treasure chests. Dark shadows in the plot will also appear from time to time. At this time, players need to escape as soon as possible. Once caught, they will go directly to Game Over. The normal game ending method is indeed very interesting. It is a pity that as long as it is a sound person, it is impossible to be Sombra caught. Although it is not a horror game, the game still has a certain degree of spiritual pollution, so players who cannot accept it in this part should be cautious when buying it. The unique RPG combat system of the game is also quite interesting, and the character design and art also uphold the high quality of the landmine club. Landmine club fans, RPG players, and day-stay players can buy it. ",True,False

"I am writing this comment 5 minutes after finishing the game in 15 hours, I am still in the effect of the end ... Every man wants to be fearless, warrior and strong like the character in that movie while watching a pure action movie in a period of his life. After the movie is over, the person lives with the dream of that character a little more and then returns to real life. I watched many movies with this kind of emotion and then I was impressed. Especially if it has a story and a solid narrative that deeply affects you, you cannot get rid of the influence of that movie, but when you return to real life, you realize that you are standing far away from that character. I still think that most of humanity does not do evil willingly, believes that killing a person is the worst thing that can be done in the world. Just like Jason Brody. Restarting life Jason Brody is a young man in his 20s loved by his friends. He has an older and a younger brother. I'm sure Jason never thought about the issues I mentioned above when he and his two siblings and four friends went to an island in the South Pacific for vacation and fun. However, life can sometimes be seriously dirty and turn even the best man in the world into a psychopathic killer, so just imagine what he can do to a man who is already crazy. After a holiday with sky diving, waterfall jumps, parties, crazy fun, Jason and his friends did not have to meet the psychopath Vaas and other crazy pirates, of course, but after the funny images we recorded on our phone, we recorded ourselves in a bamboo cage with our older brother Grant and our hands tied Vaas' When we find him listening to, we feel that this job will not end well. Ubisoft is preparing to appear with the third game of the Far Cry series and has been preparing us for this for quite some time. When we say videos, visuals, interviews, we all know a lot of information about the game now. Therefore, there is nothing I can do more than convey my experiences to you. On the other hand, considering that there will be a separate review of the game for the PC version shortly after the PS3 review here, it is possible to say that there are many things to experience, not to be told in Far Cry 3. I would like to say. Just beware! It's not a story, it's a storytelling. As a matter of fact, our story actually comes from a clich subject, but the narration of the events, how the characters reflect their personalities, intense emotional confusion is the biggest element that makes the game immersive. Jason is naturally shocked when his older brother Grant, a soldier, kills a person for the first time in front of his eyes, but when Jason kills someone for the first time he hardly learns how quickly and emotionally things are developing. However, Jason didn't show the acting that really impressed me. Indeed, since Jason's face is ""absent"" for us, we cannot bond with him very tightly, on the other hand, as you watch side characters such as the strange character Denis, the tribal leader Citra or Vaas, a serious psychopath, you seriously experience the intensity of emotion the game offers you.

You don't have direct control over what skills to upgrade. Action portion is a pretty standard affair. Zombie smashing feels satisfying. NPC behave in a way that you would expect. They are actually very helpful. Base management system is robust with plenty options; yet, it's not overly complicated. Survivors interact in very basic ways. Supply runs take a lot of time and effort. Completing missions becomes secondary to building up your base. Missions are varied and interesting. The story is decent. It doesn't feel too restricting.

"What an excellent time spent discovering and playing at Lancelot's Hangover! Yes the game was made by a single amateur developer, and it's the first time, but years of work and polish give it a look worthy of the best independent works. Be careful if you like P&C with hairy, cerebral and seriously long puzzles, go your way! Lancelot's is very quirky humor, sometimes very trashy (but within the limits of good taste), a concept more than a story and puzzles that will not give you too much trouble but will allow you to enjoy full storytelling for one or two evenings. You could have problems with the house cursor which is not very intuitive, so do not hesitate to use the space bar to display the hot-spots, the interest of the software not residing in the hunt for objects. Indeed Lancelot's is an ode to the P&C of the 90's (many easter eggs are present without overweight) but we old men of the adventure unfortunately no longer have the time to embark on such a Long Voyage, so that the short time spent searching for the Grail is still a good thing. However, you will find the principle of the three quests  la LucasArt, an inventory filled with objects more eccentric than each other including various more or less lawful products (admit I have just drawn your attention), a grimoire to ""decode"" and full of guaranteed GMO-free, gluten-free, inclusive trials promoting small businesses with a low carbon impact and just for that, it's worth playing;) Looking forward to rediscovering the game with a very possible French translation ( a future Christmas present from baby Jesus?) and who knows may one day be another part of the peregrinations of the sexiest knight in the Kingdom of England although The Quest for the hooly booze has a more than satisfactory conclusion .

"Dadcal's 4 is the solution to all of life's problems. All jokes aside, I think the game has one of the most welcoming community. Granted, players doing raids aren't always very nice (as well as people on region chat), but other than that--in my experience--the community is overall very giving and helping (especially the veteran players). I've been given numerous items from MR 20-26 players--weapons, rare mods, a complete set of a Nova Prime--for free). Most of them also wouldn't mind helping you on missions you find difficult, if you'd just ask. Almost to the point where they're eager, really. There was a time where I kept failing this one assassination mission, then a vet joined in, stomped the boss and asked how long I have been playing. Told him I was new, guy then played with me for a while, told me what things I should look for first and where to farm them, etc. I asked very basic questions, but he answered all of them. If I'm being honest, nothing like these ever happened with me in any game in my life. Whatever these developers did was magic. ",True,False

"This may not be the best game ever. But there are a couple of positive things to say about it. >The overall style was very retro kinda like Sega CD which was nice. >The characters you could play as all had different movesets and combos. >The story and the dialogue will make you smile and even giggle now and then. >There are 3 kinds stages which were beat em up's, Arcade shooter and sidescroller driving stages. This is also one of the few games where the developer himself has commented on my screenshots to offer advice on how to fix certain problems.  The only kinda like bad thing would be that the game is rather short in general but there will be a Episode 2 in the future. Some of the menu music tunes sounds like short loops which only is a bother if you are in the menu tho. Also I since I get alot of questions around playing games like this. I have a girlfriend and she is okay with with me playing  games like this. ",True,False

"The story is marvelous the fact that you can choose the ending of the playthrough is another bonus. Graphics are definitely a work of art, it's incredible. Just like in The Witcher 2, at that time no game could get near the level of detail like it had. I still haven't finished the DLCs because I don't want to end this beautiful franchise.  Game has decent RPG elements not too complicated. You can easily get connected in this universe because every character in it feels alive. Which that leads to immersion, if you're into roleplaying and some realistic stuff this game is great at it. Also side quests are not some repetitive boring fetch quests that makes you feel like you're grinding, they have pretty good storylines just like the main story.  The world is huge so there's lots of things to discover to make you feel immersed in the world. With the ultra graphics your mind will be blown away, it's a work of art. Witcher Contracts are pretty good it has the feeling of that you're really like an hunter that does research and gets prepared for the hunt but some do get repetitive. This game has background music like nothing else it gives me the chills every time. So the conclusion is pretty much this game is a must have game in your library there's always something to spend your time in. And I think it's the game of the decade, CD Projekt Red really does know what they're doing. ",True,False

"Planet Coaster is a truly outstanding game that provides both a visually impressive and rewarding experience for the player. Although, there are few issues that I have with the game, as a creative type this game is exactly what I had been looking for within the tycoon genre.  - 100% modular building system.  - Hundreds of building pieces and scenery items. - Blueprints and Steam Workshop support.  - Advanced movement tools; very handy for design.  - Basic micromanagement for staff and shops.  - Ability to choose where entertainers or staff members patrol e.g. janitors looking for rubbish.  - Intuitive coaster construction and ride customisation.  - Challenge, Career, and Sandbox modes.  - Stunning graphics and artstyle.  - Calming and unique musical score.  - Amazing sound design.  - Framerate gradually starts to fall over time due to prop detail.  - Management aspects of the game is considered quite basic by some players, however this can be looked past if you are not looking for an in-depth management experience.  - A lot of the management parts of the game are hidden away in menus that can be confusing for first time players.  Planet Coaster is a game that you can spend hours with without even unpausing the game, just to get all those tiny details ready before the guests experience your wonderland (or hell!).

I also doubted whether the game can be played comfortably without a gamepad, but I play it very comfortably. Most of the game's record holders were already playing with the keyboard. It is worth every penny, although the discount amount is generally small, I think it can be bought even without discount. ",True,False

"Highly recommended, one of the best-executed remakes there's ever been. I didn't play the originals, but it's clear there was an incredible amount of work put into modernizing the games and even improving them. I'm definitely a Spyro fan after playing this and I hope they port more games over to Steam. I'd only played one Spyro game before, Enter the Dragonfly on PS2. That was long ago, so I don't remember much of it. It was very interesting to see how the games evolved through the trilogy. He REMEMBERS all his abilities from the second game to the third game. Spyro has a lot of lines in the first game, usually some (not so) witty retort to everything; that was majorly tuned down for the next two games, which could be good or bad. The flying courses are a lot less troublesome in the third game, which also greatly reduced the amount of time to get through the story of each world. The second game is unique with pre-rendered scenes before and after each world, but it gets annoying that you have to go through everything again each time you revisit each world. Thankfully, all scenes are skippable. Also, the second game improved almost everything I didn't like about the first, especially the ability to ""hover"" at the end of a glide. Graphics are fantastic. Gameplay, well, I love collecting things and getting all those 100%s. The platforming and everything is very smooth for the most part. The games do start out very easy, but the difficulty increases nicely as they progress. There are also plenty of extra challenges to take on. It's also cool that they mix in different genres, especially with the sub-worlds in the third game, so the gameplay is more varied. I'm not sure if the Sparx challenges in the third game unlock as soon as you leave the world; I didn't do them until the end, so the upgrades they gave didn't get a chance to be very useful. Would recommend doing those as they become available. Also, make use of the nifty ""point to treasure"" feature that was added. Very helpful for cleaning up the last few gems, which can be hard to find. There's a lot more to say, I really skimmed over reviewing the gameplay. But I would recommend experiencing it for yourself if you have even a mild interest. Having a whole trilogy of games is a great value. ",True,False

"This is arguably the same as the masterpiece Quantic Dream released in 2013. This game is close to my heart as a good example of what movie storytelling should be. There is a well-made story, the elements of the story are wonderful, providing thought-provoking details, and the characters really make the story impactful. The performance of this PC release is really solid. I didn't play the Epic Games Store release and waited for this Steam version to be released. I can be proud that this is not my problem. The game can run 4K 60FPS without stutter and less than 30FPS in pre-rendered cutscenes that don't run in the actual game engine. This release was definitely worth the wait. If not everyone else, try this game. The release price of this game is solid and very good at 1800 yen. When I first defeated this game on the PS3, I thought a lot about the concept of life and the relationship with loved ones and caretakers. And how should life itself be cherished? I like this game.

"Yu-Gi-Oh Legacy of the Duelist is a duel simulator very faithful to the anime, produced by Other Ocean Interactive and Konami Digital, delivering to players one of the best singleplayer card games which makes it mandatory for all fans of the franchise . The first positive point of the game is the number of cards and the way they are acquired, here we have more than 7 thousand cards available and there is no need for you to put money in order to obtain them, all the actions you perform in the game, winning or losing will guarantee you some DP (Duelist Points) that you exchange for boosters of 8 cards each and thus increasing your options. The deck manager is also formidable, you are free to build the deck you want or play with a pre-defined deck, just purchase the cards from that deck, I spent hours building an infinite variety of decks and it is a very fun process. The game modes are very rich, you have the campaign where you follow the anime line and you can choose to use the original anime deck or a personalized deck, in all there are 5 campaigns, however the last one is only unlocked by DLC, in addition of that we have the challenges that are challenges, where the player chooses a duelist and plays against him. Also as a singleplayer mode it is possible to play sealed mode and draft mode, both very fun, but it is necessary to pay a Duelist Points fee to play it. In multiplayer mode, we have both single and ranked matches, but while I played I found very few players. In general the game is very faithful, but they have some mistakes, first a bug that bothered me well, sometimes the game just closed itself, another very weak point is the animations of the cards, it is fun to see the monster attacking in 3D, but in every duel it ends up being boring and you don't have an option to disable it, another point is the excessive number of DLCs and unfortunately the experience is only complete if you have all of them. The game is also not updated constantly, as we do not have the new types of summons and the banlist is still delayed. On the other hand, I take my hat off for the game's performance, 60 spiked spikes, without crashes or problems, the game loads very fast and the performance on the SSD is fantastic. Unfortunately the game is not in Portuguese, so anyone who doesnt know English very well will lose interest, but the game is a full plate for those who played Yu-Gi-Oh in every corner of their city, the singleplayer experience is phenomenal, which I think is missing in card games today.

"I bought Europa Universalis IV because I was bored with Civilization 6. When I first launched the EUIV I started the tutorial right away and ... I was overwhelmed by a lot of information. The game has a lot of mechanics that you need to get to know. I must admit that at the beginning of my ""career"" I was used to the turn-based game, I couldn't get used to this way of passing time. Fortunately, I learned this after getting to know the game. EUIV is one of the games you have to spend a few hours before your ""longer game"". It's worth watching a few guides and having fun with the game at the beginning, testing various mechanics. Once we learn the game, we can start trying games seriously. It is also worth getting to know various events of a given nation or the way of playing it. When we get bored with regular gameplay, I recommend that you buy different dlc. It's best to see it on YouTube so as not to buy one that will not suit our taste. A game worth recommending due to the various mechanics, a large number of pleasant dlc, historical values and the satisfaction it gives! ",True,False

"Depending on the path chosen, this game can be incredibly lighthearted, or incredibly...bleak. In the pacifist route the game is fairly cheerful, and the player earns the trust and respect of everyone they meet, and relying on these friendships is shown as a strength. The game praises players for pursuing a peaceful path. The genocide route is not something that can be done by ""accident"" much like it is hardly an ""accident"" to be a pacifist. You must hunt down and kill off each and every single monster in the underground. The background music changes, and the characters react with fear to you, and warn you to stop your actions many times. It quickly turns pretty creepy, but there's nothing inappropriate about it. The only ""accidental"" path is the Neutral path which happens by not meeting requirements for Pacifist or Genocide. Something else to notice while playing this game is that it leans heavily on players assuming things based on common video game tropes. For instance, if you screw up and restart quickly a character may call you out for restarting. In a second play through there are definitely characters who will say you look ""familiar"" at times, as if this has all happened before. All in all this is a wonderful game, and my only real complaint is that I wish there was more to love! It may still be a bit early to declare this an ""instant classic"" but I hope it sticks around for gamers to cherish and remember for years to come. For kids and adults, I think there's something we can all learn about ourselves from this simple indie title that the internet won't shut up about lately.. ",True,False

"How should I start to praise and explain this beautiful game? I've played many open world games before, open world and story games were my favorites, but I never thought of Witcher 3. One day, when I got hungry from lack of games, I was hungry and started Witcher 3 e. And at that time that day, I asked myself: WHY I HAVE NOT PLAYED THIS GAME THAT ULAN. The game and the story of the game got me so tied up that I cannot tell you. The characters, places, monsters in the game are all a masterpiece. My favorite feature of Witcher 3 is that you experience the final of the game in line with the decisions you make, or you may encounter different in-game results before the game ends. Who else offers you this opportunity? The game offers you a level suggestion before going on the main quests. You can reach these levels by doing side missions or by getting Monster contracts. Since I hadn't played Witcher before, I thought, what are the side quests? BUT it never was like that. There are some side missions that are much better than some of the missions in the game. Side missions have their own stories. And the end of the stories in these side missions again depends on your preference. So this game, apart from the main story, offers you a huge world and TONS of tasks you can do in that world. I adopted the character of Geralt as if I was doing the tasks in the game as if I was doing the tasks in the game. While searching for CIRI in our story, I was always curious that I adopted the circus so much that no matter what the results were, let's find it comfortable. I want to tell you the following: I have been playing games since 2006. I've done a lot of Open world RPGs, I've done a lot of story games. But this is really another game, give this game a chance. Also, I must say without any shame that it was the best series I finished and immersed myself in my acting history. I hope it stays that way. I can't help but finish the game by playing a total of 60 hours in 7 days. Besides, you not only feel the Witcher, but also the world, the lore, and the side missions. There are so many things that I cannot put into words here, I cannot explain. If I tried to write everything, you would only read it in 1 hour. GOOD GAMES. I WISH I WOULD START THE GAME AGAIN IF I LOSE MY MEMORY. IF I DON'T LOSE AGAIN AFTER COMPLETING THE GAME. If you are worried about whether or not to take it, take it without thinking! ",True,False

"When I saw that this game was avaible to buy again, I was over the moon. And yes, if you are a fan of the series, it's worth the money. As we know with other Telltale games, the choises doesn't really matter, for the most part. The story takes us on the same road, whatever your choises are. With minor details, of course. Hate it or love it, it's the same deal in this one. And speaking of the story, there will always be people who love it or hate it. And there will always be things that you can nitpick on or things that maybe aren't really that logical from a real point of view. So, those people who point that out in the forums are right. But, I personally wasn't really bothered by that so much. It isn't anything new. There's always been things which aren't logical or how they dealt with different characters. Some I didn't care about and there been others which made me angry for wasting a good character etc.  I personally have overlooked those things because even tho there has been some shady and hasty decisions in the story or to a character, like Kenny, for example, I always have enjoyed the ride while playing the Walking Dead and it has given us some amazing characters and stories for which I really feel strongly about. It's crazy how you can love imaginary characters/people, right? As I said, you can nitpick the story or why the devs did some things but in the end, I think they really made an amazing ending to this series which is up there with S1 and 2. S1 is still my fav, tho.  Otherwise, visually the game looks absolutley fantastic. The characters, the environment, the lightning is fantastic. Music is great too. It does a great job setting the mood. But I didn't expect anything less. The camera angle is a but weird tho. It took a little while to get used to. In conclusion, if you liked the first two seasons, then you most likely will like this one too and you will get a ending to this amazing character that we have come to love over the past couple of years. Storywise you will have to be the judge if you like it or not, the ""choises matter""- thing hasn't really changed so if that has bothered you, it still will. If not, then great!  But whatevere you think of the dev's decisions about the story I think it is worth your money because at the end of the day, it's a good conclusion to an amazing story & game!

"Screencheat is a crazy game about looking at the other players' screens to see where they are, and then proceeding to run them over with a toy horse, shoot them through a wall, blow them up with a teddy bear, or whack them to death with a fish. As you can tell from the name, the videos and the screenshots, the game is splitscreen, and everyone is invisible. You have to locate the other players by screencheating, and then go and kill them. Every kill is satisfying. A ragdoll flops into existence when someone dies, and the ragdoll models include fish-people and chickens. There is an announcer, whose accent can be changed in the options. My personal favourite is the Australian announcer :D There are 10 maps, which are well designed and colour-coded so that you can easily tell which area someone is in. There are 10 weapons, which are all unique. There are several different gamemodes, such as CTF (Capture the Fun), Deathmatch, KOTH, Murder Mystery (you are assigned a target that you must kill to gain points), and Juggernaut, to name a few. The gamemodes can be played FFA or in teams. There are also several server mutators which can be activated to create an even more hilarious/weird experience, like huge ragdolls, and Australian mode. The game supports up to 8 players on a server. 4 players is a nice number, but a full server of 8 is pure insanity, and it's wonderful. You can play local or online multiplayer, or both at once. You gain exp by playing, and as you level up you unlock bonus ragdolls (such as a hotdog) and weapon skins (such as the Cod of Duty skin for the melee weapon). Overall it's a really fun game, and it's even more fun if you have friends to play with. It would probably be a great party game. There are so many funny moments, but it can be quite competitive too, and it gets pretty intense sometimes. But it's always fun! The game needs more people playing it, so buy it sometime!

"Here, like most other games of this developer, which begin with ""Harem Girl"", and after the colon is the name of the new part, everything is according to the standard. The game starts, you are shown the basics of control in the dialog box, and then the first art that is assembled is automatically turned on 3-5 seconds and so on. Further, everything is according to the classics, probably, like all games of a similar genre, at the beginning dressed as a chan, then as you collect art, you get her half-naked and then already naked, that is, in total there are only 3 art of one girl, and all of them are in the game 20, in fact, it is not difficult to guess from the achievements of this game. Speaking of achievements. They are here and go to the main global statistics ""Steam"", which is very cool! I would like to note one art that took 3-5 minutes, namely the alchemist girl with a cauldron. You can see this art on the main store, where she pours some kind of liquid into the boiler. So, when I first assembled the boiler, I really looked and tried to understand what was wrong and how it was correct, because the center of the boiler looks too monotonous and there are few distinctive outlines in it to understand the correctness of the collection. The point is that the parts can not only be moved along the artwork and twisted, but also turned over (That is, mirrored), which complicates the collection of the ""Cauldron"". There are hints, but they are spent and given for collecting each art. I almost never used them, and some were of little use. Against the background, a depressing and sad ""OST"" is constantly playing, which you cut right away, because it introduces you into some kind of depression ... We could have done something positive. All artists have their own style of painting. The art here is very beautiful, with clear outlines and bright characters. There is also an interesting point here. It is worth remembering that if you have collected several arts, and then decided to exit, they are not saved, because you need to save the game yourself, as in a visual novel.   0.9 / 10  No / 10   1.2 / 10  No / 10  10/10   6.7 / 10   2.5 / 10   No / 10   4.1 / 10 ",True,False

"""XBlaze! Activate!"" (Updated Review as of 7/6/16) If you ever thought to find your normal everyday life wasn't normal, then you've come to the right place, we start out our story of the Azure/Blue/etc. with Touya Kagari, a normal High School student with his pals Hinata and Akira, but when Touya comes to a place of remembrance, he meets a mysterious girl by the name of Es, and the two start their journeys together. As it is, XBlaze is the prequel story to the popular fighting game series ""BlazBlue"", the lore you'll seek from BlazBlue will also be mentioned here as well, including some characters within similar familiar names and other viable info. Originally available on the PS3/PSV, the Steam release is more or less the same as it is, with a few PC options to tweak to your style, along with the option to have the subtitles either in full English or Japanese. The game is pure Visual Novel, so the game relies on its own system called the ""Toi"" (which also has Character Bios), using it wisely will decide your fate, from getting the good, bad, or even the gag endings. Using ""Tips"" will let you know on info of the XBlaze world, though some of it will differ depending on which character route you're planning to clear. Either way, the port is great, and it loads scenes and such faster than the console version (also, bonus extras if you happen to clear all routes in the game), but yes, as usual with majority PC players, there will be problems with people trying to run it, it happens to some, but not all, but it happens. That's what there's the forums/discussions are they for people to check out the issues and for users that can help out on it if at all possible. As of 3/3/16, a 9.1MB Patch/Update/Etc. has fixed some of the game's issues as I've originally mentioned before, that being the A.O.S. crash, the half and half localization errors, and probably crashes when trying to continue certain chapters/routes. There still might be some bugs in there, but will be known whenever necessary. As of 7/6/16, Aksys Games announced at Anime Expo that XBlaze Lost: Memories will now get its steam port, so yeah! \^^/ ",True,False

"A breathtaking game. Never played a better one. Great graphics, unique idea and implementation. Mods support and the atmosphere is overwhelming, not only because you are in a huge ocean full of creepy but also cute creatures. A game that is unrivaled, but without multiplayer, which would be my only point of criticism. I myself find the depth of the sea extremely interesting, so I find this implementation very successful: A stranded survivor who now has to fight for bare survival. Many craft possibilities and tools that are needed. You will definitely be able to put 50 hours into the game, but at some point you feel alone, so I would have very much wished for a multiplayer or at least a mod for it.

"For me personally, everything is white, fluffy and frosty already pretty good .., ostop ... and osto ... But for those who are still ready to see snow. Welcome to the Himalayas. Following in the footsteps of an eerily secret expedition organized by Yumi in search of another unknown shit. So, Ajay Gale continues his fascinating Asian tour, combining hunting for rare species of animals and strengthening the camp with all sorts of fashionable chips. Although, judging by the loot in the boxes, the previous hunters have multiplied everything more or less valuable by zero a long time ago, and put the skins in boxes and forgot. Local natives, for some reason, do not like guests at all. Airplanes / helicopters shoot down, prisoners are fed to Himalayan Bigfoot. They live by hunting and gathering unknown henna, from which all kinds of substances are then produced. Substances devour and go to nirvana. There are plenty of weapons, but everything is old. New copies in the DLC were not delivered. What didnt please, I categorically didnt like the absence of helicopters. If you can still get used to resetting the skill tree, then you can't live without helicopters. Fortunately, the map is small and you can drive it from end to end very quickly. I liked the process of equipping the station. And immediately there was a lack of all sorts of cunning traps in the style of John Rambo, both in the main game and here in the valley. I liked the process of searching for additional stationary weapons. Grab the truck at point A, take it to the base. And in the part where you need to think and climb the rocks. It's a pity these tasks are few. From nit-picking transport, in addition, rushing through the snow like a dry highway. It was probably worth tightening up the mechanics of the moving process.

"The new DLC is too expensive, please beg for a discount~ I strongly recommend this game, it is best to find a small partner online, you can trade to each other if you dont need equipment (but why dont my friends like this type of game and dont eat me Amway) The connection is not bad. Basically, you and your partner are the same network operator, and you can connect or not card an excellent ARPG game. The key point is to swipe, swipe until the sky is dark. (Although I have only cleared a character, the equipment is not good, and I have not graduated yet) If you like this type of game, but still hesitate between entering the game and piracy, I hope you can give developers and small workshops some support. (Personally looking forward to the next game) 1. The diversity of occupations + skills + constellations gives this game unlimited possibilities and freedom, which is also the biggest feature of dark games. 2. The game screen is slightly dark, but it fits the background and theme. 3. The percussion feels the hammer to the flesh, and the music can also be considered in place. 4. In the game, we will encounter a lot of choices, some choices will lead to the death of NPC and influence of influence, but we do not need to be intimidated in the novice period, after all, there are 3 weeks, the last week Just choose it carefully. 5. Don't look down on the green outfit. A green outfit with a good prefix is better than a blue outfit or even a purple outfit. 6. This game can also be called the Dawn of Resistance. Personally, I suggest that armor should not pursue any attack attributes. Honestly pile up all kinds of resistances, and spawning monsters can be a lot of peace of mind. 7. The character build can refer to others, but copying is not recommended. Only by researching on your own can you better understand the game. 8. Grim Dawn-Crucible Mode DLC, this DLC is almost necessary, allowing you to quickly have 10 constellation points in the early stage (although it can be more, but the first 10 are cost-effective), and it is also the most important source of purple equipment in the later stage. 9. Grim Dawn-Steam Loyalist Upgrade. This DLC is just a few skins and does not affect the game experience. 10.

"Amid sonic reverberations from a gloomy symphony orchestra, made up of steel beams and sheets that dance to the beat of the ocean current, a man in a diving suit wanders the rusty and empty corridors of a colossal corpse, buried in plain sight deep within the ocean. bluish canvas. A nineteenth-century steamship, sunk in forgotten territory where sunlight no longer penetrates, a gloomy and supernatural secret that awaits to be solved before it is too late ... It is no coincidence that the name of the vessel to be explored is SS Eurdice, because in Greek mythology, that name corresponded to a nymph who suffered a cruel fate in a tragic love story, as well as it was the name to which the HMS Eurydice responded, a vessel that suffered one of the most naval endings. tragic of England and of which it is rumored that it can be seen still sailing in the distances, in the form of ghost ship. Although the SS Eurydice from the Lazy Monday Games work is not shown as a wandering apparition, it does respond to the Greek myth, since this is the story of an explorer who, not being part of the crew, gets his place in it to be able to travel to England and thus reunite with his beloved. Unfortunately among the cargo that the ship was carrying, no one suspected the inclusion of a dangerous object that accompanied them on board. Everything would therefore remain in the hands of the explorer, since he would be the only one capable of preventing the threat from reaching port. There is no word that better defines restlessness, that uneasy expectation that takes hold as one wanders through the labyrinthine architecture of the sunken ship that does not stop screaming in twisting of metal that sounds in the distance. Without music to acclimate the progressive descent, the setting is based on the solitude of the void that is the bottom of the ocean. To do this, he uses a mixture of his pixelated art, whose surfaces create a play of light and shadows when interacting with the protagonist's flashlight, and in the background he projects a perpetual echo that helps to maintain a satisfactory mix between immersion and discomfort. Among those narrow corridors that end up leading us in circles to lead us to the loss of physical notion of the character, there is an interesting detail, because it is not a design flaw. In the letters found as you advance, the history of the crew will be unraveled, of how they began to get sick and get lost in the passages that later they said, disappeared. Said writings, wet and illegible, will be understandable when turning off the flashlight, as if time and space were twisted until they brought the protagonist to the point where they were written. What actually happens when the flashlight is turned off? That light that emanates from the diver's helmet reveals a second use when it is turned off, allowing the lamps in the corridors - still functional - to warn of a different version of the facilities, as if it were another reality. This mechanic is necessary to solve different puzzles that block the way on certain occasions, blocks whose resolution will not oppose great interactive or reflective resistance, but will allow us to realize details such as the appearance of previously non-existent surfaces, changes in the environment, supernatural events and on certain occasions, the sound of voices that are heard through the echo. These details seem to converge the past and the present in an embrace, like a memory that is brought up and remains weakly, or like a skein of hallucinations that seek to convey a message. Thanks to the insertion of this mechanism, the restlessness of the experience is increased as well as its attractiveness. It is thus, as if making use of a satisfying and enveloping setting, hand in hand with a striking mechanics, like a small title, from which little and nothing could be expected in the first instance, it ends up delivering a pleasantly gratifying game once all its ends are tied together, allowing a glimpse of the fabric of love and last will of a man in his battle against forces beyond his understanding.

So, with Among Us it was no different, the title that was originally released in 2018 for mobile version and later for computers, has been conquering several players for presenting a simple proposal and with a lot of strategy. The objective of the game is to participate in a lobby with 4 to 10 players, in order to find out who was chosen randomly among the crew, to be the imposter, and can be one or even three imposters depending on the settings selected by the creator of the living room. During the match, the astronauts will need to perform the puzzles on the map, in order to complete the objective bar that is completed according to the tasks done by each one. If this bar fills up completely, the crew wins and the fraudsters lose. However, this will not be so easy, because at all times the person who has been designated as a traitor will be sabotaging the locations on the map and killing the other crew members. At these times, it is worth using all strategies to unravel the liar in the middle of the team, through accusations, blackmail, espionage or even with proven facts. If all the assassins are expelled, the crew will win the match. Impostors can also win by killing 80% of the team or by sabotaging specific places, such as oxygen chambers for example. In addition, they can use the duct system of the scenarios, in order to move quickly or hide from possible accusations. Because it is a title for mobile phones, the game has extremely easy gameplay and quick puzzles. In addition, his cartoon graphics in 2D are super light and manage to be satisfactory by the proposal he addresses. Unfortunately, a chronic problem in Among Us is its bad connection, due to the fact that it does not provide servers in the South American region. This ends up causing sudden disconnections and high pings. Therefore, those who do not have a stable internet can suffer a lot when trying to play. In view of the aforementioned arguments, Among Us is a title that can be played by all audiences, even for those who are not familiar with the genre, because it is a super fun title that encourages socialization, as it contains an easy-to-learn mechanic. and the free version offered to both IOS and Android. Other than that, this game is recommended mainly for playing with friends, because it provides great moments of entertainment.  Contains 3 different maps;  There are 6 languages available, including PT / BR;  Active community;  Practical gameplay;  Satisfactory sound effects;  Dynamic and strategic.  Make servers available for other regions;  Correct color bugs, it can happen that two people get the same color;  Add achievements. Curatorial analysis | | ",True,False

"I was afraid that it would be difficult to play such an old game, but, surprisingly, the pixel graphics turned out to be quite pleasant and you quickly get used to it. And the other aspects of the game are good even by modern standards, a convenient and intuitive interface, it is even easier to understand the arrangement of the base and the equipment of ships with fighters than in the 2012 remake. On top of the Steam version, I rolled OpenXCOM (a modern open-source implementation of the game, which is actively supported by developers), so for the entire time of the game I did not encounter any problems or bugs, everything is licked to a shine. I don't see much point in talking about the gameplay, it is completely the same as in other games of the Xcom Universe that I have played at the moment (except for the disgusting craft called ""Bureau"") - there is a global view of the planet, there is the arrangement of bases, there is research / development, there are turn-based battles between a squad of soldiers and aliens.

"One of the most hardcore collectible card games in the new 2014 version. If you want to familiarize yourself with the board, then this is one of the cheapest ways. One of the friendliest trainings. Even a person who has never seen such games will be able to learn how to play without much effort. Of course, there are nuances in the rules of the game that a beginner will have to learn, but the game makes it possible to get acquainted with them. By the way, I wrote down my training -. A little about the cons: 1) bugs and lags, unfortunately, were not completely eliminated even by the 2014 version; 2) you cannot play with decks from previous versions of the game (2011-2013); 3) the game does not welcome third-party (unofficial) decks that can be downloaded and even installed, but it is problematic to play them online with others; 4) the idea of sealed decks, of course, brought the game closer to customization, but there is no way to play sealed decks against, say, classic builds (only against other sealed ones), as well as there is no way to play them in two-headed mode, which almost completely kills the idea with sealed decks; 5) you cannot completely collect your decks (customization is limited by the framework of decks and various tactical decisions within them - booster packs); 6) it's a pity, they didn't even think of implementing the game in a circle in the 2014 version. On the pros: 1) the game has just a gigantic number of tactics, limited only by the imagination (this, of course, is an illusion, since the imagination here means that of the authors, but the fact is that it is simply immense for them); 2) left my favorite two-headed giant mode (2v2 game, in which 2 partners play against two others); 3) design and simply fantastic art (talking about the drawings on the cards and their correspondence to the names of the cards - again, the imagination of the authors is simply amazing); 4) the classics of the genre of card games, the basic rules of the game, the thoughtfulness of the process, Magic is just fun to play; 5) a large number of decks, 1 deck of board games will cost you much more than this game.

"- You tried to kill me! You're alive, so don't complain. Hitman: Absolution is a stealth action game not for the faint of heart, the fifth installment in the Hitman series. You play for the well-known to everyone from the previous parts, Agent 47 - a clone ""Hitman"". In this game, you decide how the kill will be performed, either you kill stealthily and try not to be seen by the enemy, or you kill effortlessly and go straight (this is not possible on all difficulty levels.) Throughout the game you will try to get through difficult levels, where you will not be allowed to rest for a second, the slightest wrong movement and you have already been discovered. Very exciting passing in stealth, makes you think how to kill without being noticed. It is a pleasure to earn achievements. You are given a task to pick up a certain girl Victoria, who the agency needs. 47 agrees to the contract, even though deep down he does not want to kill Diana. She turned out to be a new project that really needs to be returned back and he will protect her with all his efforts. This game is designed primarily for stealth. A large selection of weapons will not let you think long about what and how to kill. The powerful game engine gives a very beautiful picture. You can create your own contracts and play already created by someone. For completing contracts, players receive money, which they can use to modify weapons or buy suits. The main game has a so-called Hitman: Sniper Challenge mini-game. To prevent players from getting bored, the developers made a special table that displays the progress of other players. Whoever thinks to take it for the first time and does not like games where you need to hide and disguise, then I do not advise you to take it. Decent fifth of the series. P.S. Thanks for attention.

"Not a bad platformer in which you need to bring the ball to the end of the level through numerous obstacles. All this is played better than it looks in the screenshots - I expected to see gloomy trash, but in the end I went through the whole game. In Spectraball, everything is tied to physics, you need to be able to accelerate and choose the right trajectory, any wrong movement is sent to the last checkpoint. The game is moderately difficult, but there are only 8 levels, not counting 3 bonus tests, so you can complete everything in a couple of hours. However, if achievements are important to you, then don't even try to play it, because because I can't imagine how you can complete all the stages in this game without a single mistake. So getting the ""perfect game"" in your profile will take a lot of work and exponentially longer time. In general, Spectraball is clearly not worth the full price, it is interesting to play, but the content is clearly not enough. The levels have a completely different appearance, but I would like the difference to be not only visual, but also gameplay. For example, I expected that there would be lower gravity at the ""cosmic"" level, but as a result, the physics of the ball did not undergo any changes. But if you take Spectraball on sale, then as entertainment for a couple of hours it will come off - fortunately, the game gets -90% discount quite often. ",True,False

In the later levels you have three ""lives"" so the game always stays very fair to you - although completing a level perfectly is totally satisfying. It was kinda relaxing but also a lot of fun for the little playtime you actually get (50 minutes for me). But hey, you can't really make a mistake for a price this low. I'd love to see more levels.

"""Assassin's creed"" basically became derogatory words around the 3rd-4th installment with people saying it's another Call of Duty in terms of differences between each installment and I guess Ubisoft was afraid of changing their ways, after all why alter something that already sells well, right? But oh boy, have they outdone themselves with the latest two games (Origins, Odyssey). They finally mostly dropped the real world story parts and focused on telling the Animus - the recollections part, which makes total sense considering no one ever actually cared about the real world narrative, when people think Assassin's Creed, they think Altair's and Ezio's stories, not Desmond's. Talking about characters, I only played Cassandra thus far out of the two character choices, but I gotta say she almost instantly became one of my AC favorites. They somehow managed to comply the SJW/feminist propaganda by making her a strong, self-dependent female individual while she's also very attractive, charismatic and powerful - truly an impressive feat. They also finally realized that unless they keep revealing major story plots throughout the playtime rather than only at the beginning and the end of the game, the playthrough would become repetitive and eventually boring. In Odyssey, one of the main mechanics became available after nearly 20 hours (!) of my game time. Obviously if you rush through, you'll progress way faster, but who doesn't explore and mess around in AC games..? The story itself is pretty good, it's not revolutionary by any means - good old revenge trope, but it's interesting enough to keep you engaged and there're some twists here and there. I'm not anywhere near the end of the game, so I'll refrain from commenting on this topic any further for now. Now the game isn't perfect, some people don't like the presence of an ingame store which lets you purchase ""time savers"" (cheats), but I simply choose to ignore those features - they don't really add anything meaningful to the game and it's easily playable without its usage, even on the hardest difficulty. Talking about difficulty, some fights seem to be really unbalanced - legendary creatures (such as the  pig) force you to fight in a certain way so if you chose to be a full on assassin, you literally have to respec and even then it's tough. So far, the pig fight and the fraction battles were two situations I found really frustrating, other than that everything was doable (on nightmare difficulty). That being said, I'm quite impressed how good the game is thus far. 9.5/10 easily at the point of writing this review. ",True,False

"To begin with, I'll say that before us is the same Far Cry 3, which changed the map and made the game more cinematic. The gameplay is essentially the same, but not the best console port. Optimization pleased me, because on my ""bucket"" the game runs at a stable 20-40 FPS. Pleased with the study of the open world.

Feeling as if you screwed up in life. As for the main villain ... well, how to say. Although his appearance is ambiguous, he is incredibly charismatic. Music. Of course, the soundtrack is not as good as in The Witcher, but these are completely different games. about Far Cry, so here I was pleased with the sounds of the surrounding nature. The music in the car was chosen very well, the developers realized that most of the time, we would be moving around in cars. Rabbi Ray Rana. His radio appearances are not well developed. Very often he repeats the same phrases in the interval of 3-4 minutes. At first it is imperceptible, but then it starts to enrage. When you vacate the towers, it is often fashionable to hear new messages, which are quite interesting to listen to, but again, not 3 times a day. A lot of additional tasks, a huge number of weapons, a lot of outposts, etc. Actually, I haven't seen first-person shooters with an addictive plot for a long time. Let's walk through the plot. You come to Kirat to dispel your mother's ashes. At this time, a civil war is raging there between the ""Golden Way"" and the ""King's Army"". Pagan Min, the main villain, sweetly invites you to dinner, shooting the floor of the bus, where he politely sticks a fork in the back of your friend, and then leaves to apologize to him ... by torture. You ... being frightened, run away from the place where a dumb fanatic intercepts you along the way, who will later introduce you to the ""Golden Path"" and you will play a little bit there, and then you will have to save Kirat, etc. ... well, everything is in yubisoft style. This is just the beginning of the game, I will not go into details of the plot further. Pros: 1 Great plot. 2 You quickly get used to the controls. 3 Convenient system of points distribution, crafting and more. 4 Great music. 5 Well-developed characters. Cons: 1 Not the best port from the console is immediately visible. 2 The game rarely, but still sags, especially after death. 3 Artificial intelligence.

Zombidle: REMONSTERED is an indie clicker game. In this clicker game you play as the zombies/monsters burning down and pillaging the villages full of people gaining skulls along the way. You use those skulls as your currency for upgrading your amry of darkness. Every once in a while you also run across a scroll that will randomly appear on the screen. These scrolls give you extra things such as chests that have skill upgrades inside them or you can increase the value of the skulls that drop for a few minutes at a time. All in all this is a very well made clicker game and I would definitely look into it if you're interested in something new to help pass the time. ,True,False

"Actually as of today 11/20/2019 the growth that Project Zomboid has had compared to previous years is brutal. For all those who are with the prejudice of ""it is a 2D zombie game and without very crappy animations"" or ""Very realistic but few players"", people give the game a chance, since they added in the BETA phase to the animations it is a game totally different, it is a new way of playing, thinking, adapting. Features that you thought were extinct in survival games like SCUM, Rust or others, are here. It is a singleplayer and cooperative / multiplayer (I recommend singleplayer thousands of times) with many forms of gameplay, a way to customize world creation and above all, create your character (Character creation is not a great thing but it is not so prong as before). I think that all the survival of the most intelligent or fittest turns into Project Zomboid, strategies to divert hordes, create sound devices to distract zombies, that there are countless clothes with their protection against scratches, bites, protection against the wind, isolation. People are nonsense that one will say, good to fart so many items but that is what makes the game unique and so attractive, stupid things like bathing with soap since not bathing you get dirt and in case of having a scratch or laceration you have less probability to survive than having moderately clean clothes. That there is a temperature system not only environmental, with storms, inhuman heat, winter and blizzards, there is also a body temperature system, what does it mean? That your actions within the game indirectly incur consequences to the character (NOT ALWAYS HARMFUL) that would be like sweating, being overweight under physical condition, sudden thirst attacks, etc, etc. I invite you to try this wonderful game, highly recommended and for those who are hesitating to buy it, do not hesitate to add that I will be a source of doubts. PS: After finishing the animations the price increases, so take advantage. ",True,True

You can go fishing, you can also complete quests from a fisherman and get a reward for them. You can create and build anything you want, anywhere.

"One of the few games that I decided to do an analysis. EoA, from the same producer of the excellent Skyborn, for those who played, already knows what to expect in terms of quality. The plot, without giving too many spoilers, in the marriage of his brother prince to the princess of an enemy kingdom, everything goes wrong. The princess is kidnapped and it's up to you to run after her but soon you discover that the story is not that simple and it's up to you to solve everything. The plot is very well worked, with charismatic characters, now it has a menu ""LORE"", talking about each character, which is very cool, in the course of the game you discover new places and learn more about the kingdom. The big change is in relation to combat, with the grid system, it was VERY good. The list of ACTIVE / PASSIVE skills is huge for each character, giving more space to different strategies, at the level 11 I am in, I have 5 tabs for active skill and there should be about 12 skills to choose from = D. A nice thing about combat, which has no MANA bar, skills need TP, which is accumulated with the battle and needs to be recharged (I thought it was cool that the first ""healer"" on the team, for you to heal someone, you LOSE the character's HP, very nice), and at the end of each battle, your HP returns to maximum. Craft always present, but again there was a ""compare"" to compare the items equipped with the craft item. The augments are better, with the option to remove \ o /. Very cool graphics, even though it is a RPG MAKER game, the world is very alive and worked, very positive quality of the devs. Music is out of the series too, orchestrated. I just didnt like some of the menu that are kind of boring. Overall, I score 9. I recommend it to anyone who likes an excellent RPG. ",True,False

"Ok I am biased on this review considering I am for REAL an actually Ghost sniper or so they call us that... civilians... enemy... haters... the US Government. The game is OK the state of play they use reminds me of Columbia just a different Cartel back than... we were fighting. Overall the missions are ok the timed missions suck unless I have C4 or I am blowing an entire base or compound I should not be given always 2:26 to do the stupid deed. That is funny the stupid timed missions... everything is timed down to the sec yes but I will be home eating a freaking Taco while your body bags are being loaded not waiting for my watch to hit zero trying to move a stupid truck up and down a road a mile whatever in always 2:26 drop this crap its stupid. Thats the only problem with the game I have. The AI is impressive not stupid can flank and even at times hunt you very smartly and if they dont get you especially Unidad soldiers they bring everybody and I mean EVERYBODY! twice I have actually fought Unidad soldiers over 200 in one game and playing solo just the other night easily 300 until yes they hunted and killed me and my squad by air and by ground. it appears the AI does not like the Unidad soldiers killed off it actually gets pissed off because they respawn like roaches,,,you kill 3 6 appear..you kill 6 12 appear and so on the AI gets angry. The stats kinda suck on elite soldiers, they are kinds confusing and hard as hell to understand how and when they raise...My Tactical I understand...My stealth Ok have no idea how you figure that one out because I have cleared major bases and compounds without ever being noticed and after %80 it does not move go figure and precision man ok every round has to be a confirmed kill I quess because that must be bullet to kill ratio but whatever still figuring that one out. KIA should be a stat on your player profile always good to look at a number showing enemy killed its motivating. The game is awesome graphics wise beautiful and crisp... couple hole traps where your dude falls in and you have to restart but minimal. Overall gameplay is super fluid and smooth wonderfull scenes and landscape just awesome in that department. Many complain of the grind and repeativeness but thats in real life as well only thing thats changes is the scenery you kill in Roger that. I give the Game 10/10 ",True,False

Dishonored fascinates with its plot, and delays for several days, during which, I am sure, the person who downloaded this game will pass it in one breath. The game is interesting because the ending directly depends on you. I would recommend going through Dishonored with as few kills as possible. Dishonored is good for its variety, you have a choice, and not one branch along which you have to go through the game, you can pump a couple of abilities that you will use in most situations, and you can gradually pump all the abilities, but that's already it.

"The final game in the Desmond series. American Revolution, a new main character in the Animus, a change of scenery, a bunch of goodies and significant changes in the gameplay. Why not just stuffed into this part. And the arrangement (though indirect) of his estate and naval battles (looks and operates perfectly) and the change of weather, time of day and seasons. All this, however, is not perceived as a whole, but as pieces of a general structure, which often does not work quite correctly, with malfunctions. Quite a lot of bugs for a project of this level, glitches, people appearing out of thin air, hero failures under textures, invisible walls, annoying jumps past targets. Sometimes it all looks mediocre, because the management or environment banal does not allow you to fulfill your plans. But overall, the game was a success. The story of the formation of the American state, told with humor through notes in the Animus, is not embellished, as the Americans themselves would have, but more caustic, true or something. Good plot, characters and addictive gathering do their job. In the end, the truth of ""Assassin's Creed III"" falls on its side, gets bored, the ending is disappointing. You play out nervously when it's over. The extended duration did not go to the advantage. The main character, Conor, is also annoying, I want to give him a slap so that the elders are not rude and behave normally. Although the guy survived a lot, he grew up as a hypocritical nervous psycho, moreover, he was also driven and not very smart. But he handles an ax perfectly. Despite the shortcomings, it is still interesting to play, the project is made at a high level. Fans are required to pass, others, at will, may get bored with hours of running through the forest.

"The game is really fun and hilarious, all of the guns feel great and there's a bunch of different weapons/items, it includes all the standard guns you'd expect, M16, AK, AUG, Mac-10, double barrel shotgun, Winchester, MP7, and a bunch more, and all the standard attachments and grenades, but also a bunch of more wacky over the top stuff e.g. A handcannon, that is literally a cannon you hold in your hand, banana suit Armor, implosion grenades, and so on. You can hold your gun sideways and beatbox. The over the top physics are great. Guns work similar to Pubg, having single fire, full auto and occasionally burst.  Your character has some ragdoll physics so you can do things like jump through small windows, it's pretty satisfying being able to smoothly jump out of a building window into another. There are vehicles, but right now I think there's only one type of car (?), though I'm not sure I've played enough to judge. Players in this game are essentially wacky inflatable tube men, running around feels a little bouncy, but not too much.  The controls responsive and aiming/shooting feel great  and that's coming from a guy with 4k hours in CS.  I think the bounciness of the characters helps to balance gun fights, most guns I've used seem to be hit scan and very accurate, though some guns e.g. the VSS , have bullet travel time  working pretty much the same as the VSS in pubg. The gunplay in this game is actually great. You never really feel cheated and the combat is skill based.  The game uses low poly models, but are aesthetically pleasing and cartoonish. I personally like the art style. To make a more objective comment, the artists did a very good job at sticking to the same low poly cartoon style in all of the assets and it is fitting to the silliness of the game.  1. The servers are currently getting more traffic than they can handle  the game got more popularity than the devs expected. Played a few games this morning that went perfectly, instantly getting into games with no issues, but at peak hours (on the EU servers) I've been disconnected a few times. Launch issues are normal and to be expected. 2. Framerate was a bit choppy when I started playing --   this seems to be because the  default view distance is crazy high, lowing it made my game run allot smoother and I could still see players miles away anyways. Overall I'd say this game is fantastic and great fun. While the game was made as a joke, the features are actually implemented really well to the point where I could play this game unironically. Though, it may be worth waiting a few more days to play (Time of this post 8th June) , for launch issues to die down. Though they are mostly fixed at the moment aside from occasional disconnects at the start of the game. ",True,False

"The Elder Scrolls Online tells us about the events that took place 1000 years before the events of TES V: Skyrim. In terms of content, the game surpasses all previous games in the series. If you're interested in learning more about Tamriel, take the time to complete the campaigns for all 3 alliances. Believe me, the abundance of information will make your head spin. In terms of gameplay aspects, the game combines the features characteristic of the previous games in the series with the principles of the classic theme-park MMORPG. I personally cannot imagine a better implementation of this merge than the current one. Although we have irrevocably lost such opportunities of previous TES as cutting out unwanted NPCs and stealing items, we still have the opportunity to influence the world. We can exert this influence by the results of completing quests, which, it should be noted, have several ending options. For example, we can persuade the accursed population of the village to commit mass suicide or vice versa, dispel depressive moods and persuade them to continue living. As a result, we will get either an empty village, or filled with NPCs with whom you can communicate and trade. In this case, the result of your choice is visible exclusively to you. If you saved the population of the village, and your friend did not, then he will only see how you speak with emptiness. Zenimax calls this idea phasing. Although on the one hand it looks far-fetched, expanding with the perception of the game world as a whole, I do not see a better way to create the illusion of individual influence on the world. The combat system is again a hybrid of the system from the previous games in the series and the classic MMORPGs: you aim like in Skyrim, but to simplify and solve the problem of network lags, you do not need to aim accurately - an error of several centimeters is acceptable. As in other MMORPGs, you have a skill bar, but this time it is limited to only five skills / spells. So you need to choose them wisely. It should be noted the amazing voice acting of absolutely all quests. And the quests themselves quite maintain the level set by the previous games in the series - no ""kill 10 rats"". Of course, the dialogue is animated, but there are no amazing cutscenes like in Star Wars: The Old Republic. However, in single-user TES they were not there either. The game was released quite recently and has a long time to develop with increasing content and features. So, there is still no opportunity to buy your house, which you fell in love with in early games, as well as the quest lines of the Thieves Guild and the Dark Brotherhood. However, content updates are released quite often, it is clear that the developers are busy with business, which is good news. I recommend this game as a must-play for all fans of The Elder Scrolls universe and fans of high-quality PvE in games. ",True,False

There are a few major disadvantages ie optimization which could be even better as some are still lagging and there is also some physics to improve, which both like the one in H1Z1 resembles the physics from the Farming Simulator series.

Even as someone who likes Total War, I wasn't sure if I had a good time in the first few hours. Thrones of Britannia, however, retains all of the classic hooks to get under your skin. Another rotation becomes another hour. Another hour will be blimy, where have the early morning hours gone? I wouldn't make it my first Total War - go to Atilla or Warhammer instead - but if you're looking for a more serious, less quick-witted saga, Thrones of Britannia is a winner ",True,False

"Draugen is a great (albeit relatively short) story focused adventure game in league of Dear Esther and Firewatch. It's set in the rustic village of Graavic in 1928. The game emphasize this with a black and white mode (1928 mode that I ofcourse use for full authenticity). The normal colored mode is also cool as it uses pastel-like colours to depict the antic mood of the game. The only thing that I miss in the ""fjord noir"" mode is that the sound will be on narrow bandwith like a very old tv set if you set it to black/white :) You're Edward Harding and you look for your missing sister Betty who wandered off to Norway. Lizzy, companion, jump-in-the-field side kick and game mechanic extraordinaire is adding another dimension to this game. Lizzy is playful and mischievous but also tethers to you in a way that she is a secondary angle to the story as you explore the house and vilage of Graavik. She upgrades the experience of the game in such a way that she reminds me of Elizabeth in Bioshock, minus the steampunk and shooting ofcourse but the character's dynamic interplay equals the mistery, liveliness and sense of autonomy you get from Bioshock's Elizabeth. And becaus she's so jumpy and goes all over the place to drive the story it's nice to have an accessibility feature where you will see her soundwaves from afar when she calls for you (or you call for her, which is a main feature of the game which is later being used in a pretty unique way. The game starts very lighthearted but slowly descends into.....well i'm not at liberty to tell. What I can tell is that the guys from RTG are always able to create a very distinct artistic visual mood in their games. It's an indie game but you can see that the artists come from an AAA background and infuse their exploration game with quality style and the most beautiful scenery. Just like they did with Dreamfall Chapters and TLJ. ",True,False

"Good idea to bring bunny hopping to a newer engine, but it needs a lot more work one on the strafing and the feel of the game before its fun to play. I don't think it should copy the strafe style from the source engine but rather make something new that still feels very nice to play if not better. imo it would be best to make something that encourages you to strafe smoothly rather than something where you just have to spam strafes in order to go fast. I would only recommend buying it at this time if you're curious about it and want to support the developer. I'm saying that mainly because of the lack of content, there's only 7 maps in the game right now plus a tutorial map. I think it would be a good idea to allow people to make custom maps and upload them for other people to play, even though the game is no where near to being finished i still think it would be a good idea, because i don't think it would cost much effort to do so and it would make the game a lot more interesting. I wouldn't say its worth buying right now if you're just playing it casually and are not interested in the development of it, but i'm sure it will become a very good game as time goes on. ",True,True

The game manages to juggle your emotions by showing such simplicity and flexibility that it is disconcerting. You will laugh, cry, get angry, doubt etc ...

"For me, Grand Theft Auto Vs extraordinary scope is summed up in two favourite moments. One is from a mid-game mission in which I flew a plane into another plane, fought the crew, hijacked the thing, and then parachuted out and watched it crash into the sea to escape death at the hands of incoming military fighter jets. Another time, whilst driving around in an off-road buggy, I got distracted by something that looked like a path up one of the San Andreas mountains. Turns out it was a path, and I spent 15 minutes following to the summit, where I nearly ran over a group of hikers.

"Life is Strange is one of the most interesting projects in the last few years. The plot is not comparable, all the time I was imbued with the characters, Chloe, Nathan, David, the revolutions put you into a state of affect, at the time of which your soul shouts: ""Correct it, check it out,"" you go through the game - there is no ""Illusion"" of choice, but as soon as you come to the finale, you understand that you are being shoved with a difficult choice, which can be said and put pressure on you, but at the same time you understand that all your choices are scattered into dust , simply because you are offered, either you kill the person you loved for the whole season, or you kill other characters that you loved no less, so as for me, the ending turned out to be bad simply because your choices become an illusion and are canceled when choosing (And if you take it from the dramatic part, it's very good).

Music / Sound:   Music suitable for the game world and very basic sounds during combat. Gameplay:   Interesting gameplay. You manage your harem of gladiators like a professional sports team. Interesting content and relevant strategic choices: choice of tournaments, management of the health and knowledge of gladiators, up to the management of horse races. Lifespan:   Lifespan of approximately 5 hours with a background story. The game is rather short but will give you a hard time and will not tire you if you start it over.

"This is a rare case when you can play and listen to your music, because it does not interfere with the gameplay. It's definitely better to play with friends, but one is also quite good at it, I planted some cactus in the yard and called it Rain, quite a good replacement. Of the minuses: tens of unfamiliar management, although I would not say that this is a direct minus, because you can slap on to everything. There are also some microfreezes that you don't want to get used to; an inconvenient system of hints about fossils, there would be at least a notepad where you can write down what comes out of what comes out of it (well, or I just haven't doubled in where it is displayed), because I just really forget what I need to find in order to melt some material .. I saw negative reviews about graphics, and so, this is a feature of the game, right now it would be better to dig into the graphics in 2O19, besides, to such a sandbox. From the pros: an interesting crafting system, a system for researching new gizmos that will help you achieve greater comfort in the game, exploring the world itself, planets, space, yourself, a survey simulator is simple; a separate plus I will note the spectrum of emotions of the little man, although there are not many of them The game has something to strive for, because the gameplay, I think, a maximum of 100 hours, it would be worth adding more new chips for the game, but overall excellent. 9 out of 10 chubby astronauts ",True,False

"What times of the Hitman Blood Money, when when taking the rifle out of the briefcase, the bald man went and armed it part by part, and when he put it away he disarmed it accordingly. Or when at the end of a mission there was news related to it, recounting the events and their consequences, and that varied according to your actions. Or when you could customize the weapons at ease with the pay of your missions. You even had a level of notoriety, and how you performed a mission could influence the next (which could be a bit of a ball buster but you could even pay for ""services"" to reduce that notoriety). These are things that I consider made that game the best of the saga. Today it seems that it costs more to take care of the small details even with large graphics engines. >> But when peeling the bank and as a stealth game it fulfills its mission. It has plenty of content and if you had the 2016 version it allows you to add all its remastered missions, obviously without paying more.

"In Slime Rancher you take the role of Beatrix LeBeau (I bet someone came up with that name at a nightly pee-break) who moves far away from earth to earn her money by ranching little colorful, like wobbly Bonbons looking balls. ""Slime Rancher"" consists of three main game mechanics: Exploration, expanding and maintaining your ressources and slimes & researching new gadgets to get those tasks done more easily! You start your first day at your (still empty) ranch... Equipped with a big vacuum cleaner you now start sucking up the little slimes and hoard them in ""corrals""; what a nice little euphemism for ""cages"". Those corals can now be upgraded with special extensions, that help to keep your new little friends happy and safe inside their new homes. You can put different slime types in one corral, but not all slimes come along with each other as you might expect just by looking at their adorable faces. Each time you feed a slime  they develop the natural need to free themselves after a while from the processed food.  Their poo in form of ""plorts"" can be sold to earn money, but if a slime finds a plort from another slime race it will just eat it and voil... you created a mixture of the two slime races! Those slimes then change their size and look and experimenting which combinations are the most pleasing looking or profitable ones can be a blast!  But be cautious: Some slimes want to be free again and will do everything they can to escape their new corrals... so alway buy them toys, feed them regulary and upgrade their corrals depending on their unique needs! Some combos can even end up into some really evil mutations that try to destroy your farm, infecting other slimes to do the same! The only way to get rid of those ""tarrs"" is shooting water at them.. and then they are gone forever! Let's talk about Slime tech a bit now: After some days you will be introduced into the research of new gadgets, upgrades and tools to gather new ressources (e.g. with pumps that you can place in the landscape) or tools to open tresure boxes that contain blueprints for more slime tech or decorations for your farm. Those gadgets make your life as a rancher easier, add more variety to the gameplayloop and help to personalize your farm... Jep it is indeed! The more you progress in the game, you explore more areas with unique biomes - each area has its own theme, slimes, architecture and music. Exploring the map calms you down a lot after a busy day, if you are stressed out often this is the perfect way to relax and forget the bad things in life for a while - in this game you get a full load of happyness spreaded all over your mind. The pleasing artstyle, combined with mood-enhancing  environmental sounds, neat animations and an ambient, perfectly fitting soundtrack by Harry Mack result in one of the most calming gaming experiences I had in years!...

"This is not a game for everyone, it has a steep learning curve and many things are not explained to you in-game and require you to use external webtools, read wikis and watch video guides. This is not to say that it's impossible to learn most of the mechanics and inner workings without them, but if you go in blindly expecting to grasp its mechanics all by yourself, you'll have a hard time. With this being said, let's start with the review. The Galaxy  The milky way in a true 1:1 scale featuring over 400 billion star systems, many of which have tens or more planets. There are many places to visit, including famous star systems like Alpha Centauri, Sirius, Canis Majoris, our solar system (Sol), etc. The engine that generates the galaxy gets a lot of its data from real world star catalogues, so most systems that are close to the player's start are from real astronomical data, while the vast majority of the rest is procedurally generated. Other than planets and regular stars, there are black holes, neutron stars, white dwarfs and nebulae to see. Flight Model  This is something this game does very well, flying in this game is so satisfying and immersive. Learning to fly is not difficult, but simply requires a bit of practice. After a while, flying becomes second nature and you'll see yourself docking and exiting stations all the while boosting and avoiding deadly collisions without dropping a sweat... most of the time anyway. Furthermore, the flight model offers a second mode, where the player has much more control over his ship's movement but disables everything that the flight computer does to correct your rotation and trajectory, resulting is easy loss of control and unwanted spinning if the pilot doesn't understand what he's doing. This is not something I'd recommend for newcomers, and even veterans unless they understand the benefits of it, so stick with flight-assist on. So what do you do in this game? You do what you want, really. The freedom is both a gift and a curse of this game, sometimes you lack a direction to go and things to do because unlike other MMOs or games in general, there isn't really a goal to this game unless you make one for yourself. You start small and humble and you make your way up, earn credits, ranks, buy ships, upgrade them, etc. This game has its flaws, it can be grindy sometimes and 'burnouts' can happen! There are 3 different 'playstyles' to this game: Combat (bounty hunting, assassination missions, joining the war effort, piracy, fighting aliens...) Trading (passenger transportation, space trucking, mining, smuggling...) Exploration (discovering planets [and immortalizing your name on them forever], discovering ancient ruins, crashed ships, taking tourists to far away places...) 'Horizons' Season Pass  I highly recommend this DLC, as it's featuring many new mechanics and additions that only improve upon the game, if you're planning on exploring a lot (landing on planets), or if you're into PvP and advanced combat (aliens) this is a must buy. Read my review for the DLC here. ",True,False

"I think the game is fine. It is a mixture of Dark Souls and Darksiders. It has a system that takes a short time when playing at Easy and Normal difficulty, but increases the playing time by the same rate as the difficulty increases. Nice but has a bit of a familiar story. Since the English translation is half, you can break away from the texts in some places because the vocalization is in Chinese. The gameplay and variety of weapons you can use is abundant. Each weapon has its own set of special abilities, which prolongs the gameplay. I have completed the Sword and the Long Spear, you can say ""Stick and Fist"" this time and play with new weapons again. The space designs are fine. Character and enemy designs are very satisfying. Puzzles are not very difficult, so they don't bother you. I've encountered a sound bug in a few places, but it didn't bother much. His workshop is varied and plenty of community content for both character and weapons, and most of them are just fine. All DLCs are for visual purposes. You do not have to buy it. You can find more than DLC content from the workshop, but I recommend you to buy the game in full because it is always on sale and it has a very good price. ",True,True

"In my opinion, the plot is quite simple and straightforward, without any turning points, nothing surprised. With the High Resolution Texture Pack DLC, the game looks juicy enough, especially the explosions, but unfortunately there is no such thing that explodes the imagination, except that there are beautiful views in some places of the wasteland and not only. Standard Bethesda music, beautiful and simple at the same time.  Various side quests  A large number of characters, both minor and major  Huge selection of weapons and equipment, classics of the Bethesda genre  Various locations and their design component  Of course, the choice of different endings and solutions of quests  Modifying equipment looks pretty fun  A sufficient number of perks, everyone can find their own style of playing in it  A frankly simple plot in my opinion  An absolutely useless system of settlements in the game - defense and development of resources for them, this is all boring and does not attract attention  None of the Factions presented in the game I was not interested in any way, they all think too superficially, but towards the end of the game I still decided - the Brotherhood of Steel, they still have weapons, helicopters and a huge airship, and what else does a man in the wasteland need  Quite mediocre DLC, except of course Far Harbor and partly Nuka-World. DLC Automatron - honestly very disappointing with its length and ending. Even at the highest difficulty level, it was almost impossible to kill me towards the end of the game. I was a tree and stood still :) In my opinion, the game is still worth the money and the time spent, especially when I knocked out all the achievements in it! But for the DLC provided by Bethesda, I would like a more modest price tag. 7/10 ",True,False

"Back in the day Borderlands was a real game changer for me (no pun intended). It was one my first PC games bought on Steam, back when it was all sold in dollars, not even local currency. My currency was stronger compared to dollars then, though, much better times. Before Steam my life was basically piracy, buying cracked games ripped in dvds and installing them. It was fun, but Steam opened great windows, and some great games I only had the chance to play after that. Borderlands was one of the first ones from that batch. It wasn't my first great co op experience, though, that one goes for the first Killing Floor and Left 4 Dead. It was my first experience with an RPG style FPS though.  What really has always impressed me about some games that really marked my gaming life, though, is the atmosphere. Nowadays I don't feel that as much, anymore. But back in the start of the decade games like the S.T.A.L.K.E.R series, Metro, Borderlands and others had this great impact. Some time later Borderlands 2 was released and that game is still one of my favorites ever, played it for more than a thousand hours and had tons of fun playing with many friends. Still, I think the atmosphere of the first Borderlands is still a lit better than in BL2. The sound, the western feel... Just amazing. Other than that, if compared to BL2, this game also is less restricted with violence, which contributes a lot for the atmosphere and gameplay. But that's about it. I think Borderlands 2 is better than this game in every other possible aspect. This enhanced version does not feel a lot enhanced, but it is possible to see some graphical improvements. I also enjoy the changes to the HUD system and some of the sounds. It also does feel faster. But the differences to the original seem to stop here. It just a small enhancement, really. Some issues are still there, bugs and warts and all.  Is it worth full price? Not really. Definitely not if you already played the first one. Wait for a nice sale and give it a shot if you never played it.  However, I am grateful to have received this for free and had the opportunity to play this game again and do some of the achievements. Give another shot to the DLC (and some of the terrible grindy missions) and remember some points of the story, before the eventual release of Borderlands 3 on Steam. ",True,False

"Well. Very very big fan of Davey Wreden's previous game, The Stanley Parable, it was essential for me that I did not buy the last game he released and that he only announced a few days ago. First of all, The Beginner's Guide, is not a game. Nothing that exists looks like this and this ""game"" is extremely bizarre. So, considering it a normal game is a very bad idea. After I finished the game, which lasts about 1h30, I read on the internet and I found the jeuxvideocom test and I did not like it. (Go eat carrots at woofi jeuxvidecom, you deserve only that) If you want to enjoy The Beginner's Guide, I strongly advise against reading and watching videos about it. Spoile is very easy in this game and can spoil the ""experience"" easily. The game currently costs $ 8 on the Humble Bundle Store, which should be $ 7.15, so it doesn't cost that much, but beware. Some people might feel robbed after completing the game and others might feel privileged to have had access to it. After, the 1h30, it's over and you won't risk opening it before forgetting it. Sharing it with other people is a good idea, however. If spending $ 8 for yourself is a big expense, then I would not advise you to buy the game. Buy this game only if you really want it. Knowing that each person is different, each person can interpret this game differently and while some people are going to like this game a lot, others just won't like it or understand it. Be very careful with your purchase here if you are going to purchase the game. I would characterize the experience of this game as philosophical and psychological at some point. It evokes concepts centered on individualism, but I do not speak more about it. The game only creates questions and doubts, without really giving an answer. Imagination and creativity are also a central element. The level design is crucial. In my opinion, I think the Beginner Guide here represents the beginner's guide to the level designer (Before I begin), but I could also be wrong, or there could be multiple meanings. The game is narrated in English, but has a lot of text translated into French and you can turn on dialogue subtitles. Being able to understand English is a big plus though. I don't know how the experience can be if you don't understand English and just read and it is clear that the experience will not be the same. Anyway, I don't really have anything else to say. It is indeed a very mysterious game. I can only advise people who want something ""special"" to play this game. Take your time and try to understand everything that is going on. Understand what you are reading and what the character is saying. Understand what the ""game"" (or level) you are playing means to you. Lots of deep thinking. I clearly see 20-page Domfulmen-style reviews of this game (Cuckoo) Anyone with huge expectations from this game will be disappointed. Just having no expectation.

"A truly wonderful game that is really worth trying. Especially with friends. The main component of the gameplay is a variety of robbery raids, raids and operations, so to speak. They consist in completely different things: ways to avoid being pursued by guards and the police, disarming alarms, planting drugs in a certain place, preparing them, and so on, much more. There is a great variety of different tasks, missions, which are gradually released and become available for download and play. You can also use certain types of equipment and weapons, which also differ in their characteristics, in the ensuing battles. And a smartly equipped team undoubtedly has a higher chance of success in a given operation. It will appeal to everyone who likes a variety of works of art on the theme of charismatic lawbreakers. Their adventures here are made in the atmosphere of a Hollywood action movie, which only adds dynamism and complexity. ",True,False

"I took it I took it I took it And throw it Shadowgrounds. Maaaaaaan!  Released in 2005, Shadowgrounds is a game of crazy originality. Aliens have invaded your ""Martian"" colony (you're on Ganymede actually, but that doesn't change the taste of the mash) and you're going to have to survive, then become such a monster bugger that, frankly, we're going to doubt that you are really doing it to save your own skin. Let's get along well, this game does not offer anything revolutionary. Neither today, nor in his time, neither in form nor in substance. The scenario will take you to the settings of offices, labs, offices in labs, through mines and everything that represents the cheapouille of genre cinema. Small burst of pride - not originality - when the last levels will take you through the alien ship, with a design as clicheton as the rest. Common lines which will also be found in the characters. The heroic mecanic who makes fun of being like I'm cool, but who accepts without qualms all the suicide missions entrusted to him, in total disregard of his condition as a simple civilian surviving among supposedly much more trained soldiers. With him you will have the pretty grandpa of service, the cowardly scientist, the veteran with his brush cut that dies sacrificing himself for you and even the black who dies first, because the black always dies first. When we think that Frozenbyte is a Finnish box, we find here all the codes applied to the first degree. Shadowgrounds is risk free and is exactly what you expected. Even though there are a few attempts at personalization via a nod to Robocop, Abyss or Alien, it is the B series in full without wanting to extricate itself from it. A game that would be stamped Uwe Bowl if it didn't escape it with its lack of vulgarity and cool action. Not great, but cool. Although of a generally low difficulty, you will have some moments of fun. Especially at the beginning, during the discovery phase of this invader which comes out of the ground in corridor levels, but in the open air. Do not make the mistake like me of saving the bullets of your gun, they are, for the basic one, unlimited. Others will then be added, all of which can be customized via 3 improvements that you can buy by accumulating coins that enemies drop randomly. A little gameplay trick that has its charm, as well as the management of your flashlight which will run out and will have to ask you to turn it off to let it recharge. Managing your light in dark settings, with sometimes enemies waiting for you in a vicious corner of the room, will bring this little cop side who rakes the rooms by securing each area before progressing. You may even be surprised to be attacked from behind if you constantly forget to take a look at your motion detector. This will not prevent you from confronting some problems of the game. Sometimes your character will be blocked by a setting for no apparent reason, just like the enemy, which you can sometimes shoot without difficulty where Shadowgrounds had intended to offer you a little of stress. You also won't always know whether or not your bullets are damaging inert or metal structures. And it will happen that your character does not shoot when you ask him to. Last bug quite rare, but still present and really frustrating. Fortunately, there are many care kits (to be taken strategically) to overcome any problem during the game and each level allows you 5 lives. Enough to end the adventure without too much problem. The lifespan is 7 to 10 hours. For my part, I did one to two chapters per day out of the 11 proposed. The game is getting boring quickly enough, even if it is a pleasure to go back the next day to continue the adventure. Shadowgrounds is therefore a game without any originality, but which keeps the modest promises made and offers some joyful moments. What to leave with satisfaction, even if we doubt return one day. 5 euros a game is not theft. But it is often in big promotion which brings it down to less than a euro, and there frankly there is no longer any reason to sulk his pleasure. If you like genre cinema and want a little adventure that will remind you of old playstation games like DIe Hard Triology or Star Wars Episode 1, Shadowgrounds is a good little opus to skip. Have fun. ",True,False

"It may not be right to write reviews without leaving early access, but considering the content and price the game currently offers, it is a production that should definitely be preferred. The game, in which you can smash almost everywhere you can see with the physics engine it uses, is voxel-based, but it instantly immerses you with its light, water, flame effects, atmosphere and sounds. The feeling of destruction is very solid. You can wreak havoc with the various equipment you have, as well as the various construction equipment, cars, and trucks you can use. I should also mention that; vehicle dynamics are really better than most games. So does this game tell us to let go, go, smash, explode? There is sandbox mode, yes. However, the main part of the game is the campaign. There are several maps in the game for now. There is also a map of your own workplace. On this map, you get various tasks from your computer via email. There are main and side tasks within a job you take. When you enter the task, you plan without any time limitation at the beginning. You set a path for yourself and think about what to do and how. You ask why? Because there's an alarm of some junk that needs to be taken. When you receive this item, the alarm starts to ring and you have to flee from there within 60 seconds before the cops arrive. You have to do all the main and side missions within those 60 seconds, and of course, you have to think very cunningly. It was definitely exciting and strategic. At the same time, you have the opportunity to find many valuable items in hidden places and homes. You can improve your own equipment with the value of these items. In addition to tools such as hammer, spray, fire extinguisher, blower, there are bombs and firearms. It is beneficial to use these equipment properly in the planning phase because the use, tube, and bullets of some are limited. Except for Campaign, sandbox, a map editor has been introduced in the game, but for now, this is possible with non-game 3rd party programs. It is stated that they are willing to support the mod. In the future, I hope Steam Workshop support will come. I also want to talk more or less about the destruction, which is the aim of the main game. We've seen it in Voxel-based games and games with some destructible objects: Physics doesn't work exactly the way we want it to. However, I can easily say that this game can access the Battlefield physics engine. Yes, when you want to demolish the huge building, it is a fact that the whole building remains in the air when only one piece remains unbroken. However, in general, it is absolutely satisfactory and I would like to point out that you don't get stuck with these details when you see the game's prowess. You enjoy it when you get into a fast vehicle and jump into a house with the last gas or when you dive into a building with a bucket. As a result, if the dynamics interest you, you can get it without hesitation. Although the content it offers is not much, it is sufficient and satisfying. You have the chance to try many things with Sandbox. I also think it will become a lot more fun as it continues to be developed. ",True,True

"The Madmax universe has recently been experiencing a kind of unexpected renaissance. First, the film sequel was striking, after the premiere it became clear that the cult series can be reliably and boldly revived, guaranteeing not only symbolic praise from fans, but also a large inflow of tangible cash. It is not known which factor had a stronger impact on Avalanche studio when making the decision to transfer Rockatansky's adventures to the three-dimensional world, but it was the game of the Swedish team that intended to repeat the success of George Miller. And although it is rather difficult to talk about success in terms of purely gaming for many reasons, the peculiar charm of the production can still stick to the monitor. Universe lovers can rest easy - Mad Max presents the player with a coherent vision of a post-apocalyptic world filled with dirt, rust, in line with the spirit of the cinema prototypes. and dust. The title, without further ado, first throws us into the middle of the action (we watch a movie showing the bloody fight of the protagonist with an oversized Scrotus), and then throws us into the middle of the sandy wastes ruled by self-proclaimed gangs and organizations, mercenaries running around the desert in armor and mutants glued together from scrap metal - madmen traversing the vast wilderness in carts. The creators of the Just Cause series managed to smoothly fill the production with a variety of flavors, characteristic concepts and spectacular spots, at the end integrating the gray-and-gray atmosphere into everything, which made a very positive first impression on me - especially since the set of the action, thanks to a brief introduction, does not seem hermetic and it should not scare even people unfamiliar with the universe. The first minutes therefore promised a really promising experience. Source: ",True,False

"So, the game from CAPCOM paid off. Everything was great. Only 2 flaws were noticed: they spoiled Dante's sword style, so it became inconvenient to play, and also a little silly characters. Especially Trish and Lady. Trish is Dante's friend, the coolest girl. In the fourth part, she was generally gorgeous. And the Lady in the third part was generally the boss with whom Dante fought. And show them such suckers, as well as worried females. Horror. And also this smoker drove loaves ... Definitely, here they went too far with the colorful characters. The rest of the game is great. The meat is provided, the buzz is pouring everywhere. The presentation of the story is also excellent. Where did this V come from? We will learn this only in the second half of the game. Who is this V? We will know this only at the end of this game. Also, Kapkom is great for not deviating from the canon. Artemis, Geryon, Cerberus, and the corresponding weapons from them are all gorgeous. True, Doctor Faust could not have been inserted. V turned out to be an interesting character, a kind of master of creatures. And this is still unusual. We are used to the fact that the owner of the creatures is found exclusively in RPG (necromancer Diablo 2 or occultist and necromancer Grim Dawn).

"I just got banned again with a new character, what a ban system. A masterpiece in graphic and artistic sections, a magnificent script and incredible optimization, unfortunately a deficient and very erroneous online anti-cheat system. GTA V, a masterpiece of this decade. I could say that it is a perfect game but unfortunately its Online is not since it has a bad reporting system and many hackers and flamers. My experience: I had previously played GTA V on console and it seemed like a masterpiece as I said before. I hadn't had any problems with Online and it seemed like one of the best games ever made ... Until I got the wonderful idea of buying it on PC to enjoy next-generation content for Online, a serious mistake. I played online for 8 hours over the course of two days, but this day everything changed, for no reason, Rockstar suspended my account for a month and now I will have to start the Online over again (Because the new suspension laws say that).

I didn't really understand how much work had gone into it. After spending 8+ hours finishing the game and watching the feature (do this only after completion) I feel like this was a true gaming experience that should not be missed. It pushes development boundaries tackling   the difficult subject of psychosis with respect and by working alongside those people who live through it.

The sound design is also fantastic; with sound effects scattered throughout to make your skin crawl and a soundtrack that sets a perfectly spooky, atmospheric scene.

"An entertaining game in the RPG genre. Pretty much pulled me in and began to spend time in it quite often. Proved the 6th rank of mastery and was thinking about purchasing donat currency (Platinum). Naturally at the office. the website, the prices for it bite, and the toad chokes me (No friends, not a girl), in the end I agreed on 1 site with the purchase of platinum for a penny. I bought one, enjoyed life, and since the toad was choking strongly, I bought 400 + - from the power of platinum. Naturally, I leaked it on the first day. And as a result, the moderation of this wonderful game considered it a matter of honor and duty to give me a maaaaa little podgalyanka. Actually what I want to bring. I, your humble review poster, received a BAN or, for cultural people, a blocking of the game account. And that's all, I thought, kaput, until I remembered that there was still a discount for the purchase of platinum at 75%, I thought Ill get out of it and then Ill go to shape the waffle frame for myself, but ""I fucking fantasized myself"" - the developers thought and said, ""Fuck you, my friend, buy without taking into account the discount and we will unban you, good fellow. "" Well, I naturally sent them to my jade stick and went to delete the game, because the toad is now strangling even more and says what an idiot I am.

"It's fun if you like puzzle games. I found it relaxing and enjoyable, that is until I got to a certain point of the game. I think they were onto something with this. The blue and red stages were very fun and enjoyable, and I wish they would have stuck with that concept and pushed it throughout the entire game. Although at the time of writing this review, I only have a half hour on it, it was mostly because it stopped being fun and enjoyable once I got to the green section. It was fun, enjoyable, relaxing, that is until it kicked you in the face with the green part and was more frustrating than anything. That's not to say there isn't a person that would love this game. Anybody that derives an enjoyment from hard puzzles should absolutely love this game. But I'll have to say, if you're interested because you just want to unwind on something simple and fun, you'll only enjoy the first ~20 minutes worth of this game. After that, it stops becoming relaxing and more mentally intensive. If, in the future, they release another version of this game with just blue and maybe red sections of this game expanded upon further without throwing in the green and beyond, that is something that I would completely recommend. For now, though, I'm torn on a recommendation. I can't simply say yes, and I can't simply say no. It's a game for a type of person. If you are that puzzley, determined person, then this is completely for you. If you're somebody that gets frustrated easily, this isn't for you. ",True,False

"Pros: Game revolutionized the Dead Island franchise, with parkour, which makes mobility very easy and with an adventurous footprint makes the game even more phoda! Another differential is the game being 24 hours, in which the scores at night are doubled due to the danger, and moments of escape when detected by volatiles or night hunters. The enemies are ghastly like any horror game, but some have a certain resemblance to Left4Dead2's special infected. Multiplayer PvP, in which one plays as a predator and the others as a survivor, in this mode can play up to 5 players. Very superior graphics and excellent soundtrack. Cons: As always, there are those little bugs typical of Dead Island, but not as crusty. The protagonist of the game is Kyle Crane, so all the players are him. They could have put different characters, with different abilities as in Dead Island. The price. It's not worth R $ 129.99. The ideal is to buy when you are on sale. In short: Techland finally gave in. 8/10. Super recommend! ",True,False
"Dying Light is a great survival game in the zombie-infested city of Harran. Buying this game, I thought that I was buying an average game about zombies, of which there are now in bulk, even the trailers did not inspire anything special. But I realized how wrong I was when I survived my first night in this game. Pros  + Parkour. Seriously, he really fits into the atmosphere of this game. This is what Dead Island lacks, but it is also a necessary part of survival here, and adds interest and variety. + Zombies. Bored with regular, standard zombies? Receive and sign. Here you will also have zombie cops, who are indistinguishable from the real ones, as well as zombie athletes who can catch up with you and rattle about the noise in the city. As well as jumpers, runners, spitters, bouncers and thugs. To your taste and color. + Physics and murder. Crush and kick these living ghouls. You can gently break their legs with a bat so that they cannot run away from you, cut off their arms so that they cannot reach you with their unwashed fingers, fall on them and kick them with both feet, in general, by any means prove who is the real killer. + Crafting and skills. Collect blueprints and make a flamethrower out of Gordon Freeman's ordinary scrap, and even turn an ordinary table leg into a deadly stick of fate. Pump a huge number of skills and you will learn how to elbow zombies, learn to walk over their heads (in the literal sense), and many of your other fantasies will come true. + Multiplayer. Special thanks to the developers of the game for this, because you can play this game with your friends. And also the wonderful ""I am a zombie"" mode, where you can test yourself as a deadly human hunter. This is really commendable, because this is just a mode where some games are entirely composed of only this mode. (I will not point a finger at these games.) + Atmosphere. Beautiful landscapes with beautiful graphics, accompanied by scary sounds, as well as a good plot with a crazy antagonist (after all, madness is in fashion today, right?)

"Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age, originally released for PS4 and Nintendo 3DS in 2017, is a turn-based RPG developed by Square Enix, designed and written by Yuji Horii and illustrated by Akira Toriyama, despite being the eleventh game of the series, it is not necessary to play the previous games as there is no chronological order. It is impossible to tell the story of the game without any kind of spoiler, which is actually a very strong point, several doubts will arise in the progression of the game, but throughout the story everything is very well explained, in short, the main character is chosen defeat the ""Dark One"" and bring peace to the world of Erdrea by repeating a legend that took place in the era of heroes. DQXI maintains the tradition of old RPGs, turn-based game with level up system, spells unlockable at certain levels, as well as skill points acquired when leveling up, these points can be used to acquire skills, increase status and unlock others spells. All characters have a temporary boost in battles called Pep Up, the character has a kind of blue aura, this ability increases the status and releases unique abilities that can be combined with other characters. There are several items to collect during the game, which can be collected in bright spots on the map or by dropping enemies, being used to forge equipment or to complete side-quests. DQXI was one of the best RPGs I've ever played, a solid game with an excellent story, the beginning doesn't get very exciting, but it gradually improves as the characters are introduced to the group and their motivations are revealed. The characters are charismatic, there are several side-quests and mini-games, it has everything an RPG needs, don't think twice about buying this game if you enter a 50% promotion, it will be worth every penny spent, DQXI is the type of game that ends and you still want +.

"One of the most underrated games on steam. This is Super Smash Bros on PC. Megabyte Punch offers you a great SSB experience featuring a good campaign/story mode single-player/coop full of action and treasures, a lot of customization. You may change every single part of your robot. And of course, a great local multiplayer. If you never played SSB before, it is still a great alternative, as most of SSB abilities are available here, and unlike SSB, you're the one who chooses which abilities you're carrying with you. Pros + Great SSB (clone?) + Strong Local Multiplayer + Entertaining Soundtrack + Hidden treasures + Extensive customizable options + Rich colors Cons - Bad controls if you've never played SSB before - Dialogs may be annoying to get rid of them Play it, specially for the local-multiplayer mode.

"Greetings This is my first review.   At first I was disappointed becasue my named got changed from Sesshomaru to Sesshoomaru. After playing almost two years now I got used to my name and even my friends call me Sess now days.    This game is a fun game to sit down and play during a long day at work or school. You really do feel like you are a Lord ruling over your own villages in a bigger empire picture with all the other Lords and Ladys and helping your fellow players along the way.  In this game is where you can met people all over the world and you can help each other out. You can work together and fight together and its also great way to play with your friends too.    I also like how Stronghold has added more quest to to earn cards and wheel spins. Good job! I think it would be cool if Stronghold have automonks to send out cure disease or even bless of your own parishes. How about away to save you village like the way you save your castle? So all and all I have fun playing and excited about what new upgrades will come out next.   Here is helpful tip, When its say ""steam needs to be online"" which steam is online, well don't threat do I as do.  Right click on the mini steam icon in the task bar and click on stronghold and play. I hope that helps if it dose leave me a thumbs up!   You can come follow me in House 3 in World 3 eng.

"- The game is open world that is wide and very detailed. Nature, forest, Khao Phrai, weather, there are hundreds of villages or an extremely large town. Walking in the city, if you don't mark first where you are going, you will surely get lost. The people were walking around The shops that were located were lined up. Get the atmosphere of the city of civilization. - The game system looks very simple, focusing on general teeth. There is a counter of the escape scene, using magic mixed with drugs, create a bomb, create the oil that is used to plaster the weapon to attack the enemy stronger. Which when it comes together while playing it is very fun I met one kind of teacher, used a kind of medicine / oil. Encountering another type, throwing explosions to dissolve magic power Or you can use magic to kill each other. - Mini games, playing card games are well made. Play and enjoy a lot. The feeling of playing yuki in the past Send spy. Draw cards repeatedly. Load more ATK combos. Send X2 power buff cards. Close with sending a field card, block power hahaha, cool to the point that it's being developed as a standalone game - the main quest is very long. Choosing answers that affect different endings Including small events that may occur if we choose another answer throughout the play. But the coolest point of this game is """" - side quests. This game is very, very heavy. Not like walking from point A to delivery B, or going out to kill only this number of monsters and complete the quest. But every sub-quest has its own story. There are various events where we can choose to finish the quests. Geralt (myself) also has a guide to explain things during this quest throughout this quest. Which just a normal side-quest has already pumped a lot of time to play Here there are also competitive quests. Hunt rare monsters, treasure hunts, and challenge Duel throughout the kingdom. Stealing Rare Cards - The details of the game are so great that you don't really know what to find words to describe. It's not just full But it is a step closer. For this game, the size has not yet been added. DLC is still extremely large I did not feel that I had to cut the game to other DLCs and also have free DLC that is worth more. Even if you buy the full price. But if there is no time to play, then another story. You can wait and reduce it :) - talking about some disadvantages Buck has some sporadic But not so serious that it affects the play (the patch has been fixed almost all), some bugs, dev has released it. Like a horse bug Just kidding yourself, slapping jokes in the DLC, and when you're playing, is it a disadvantage? Hub ...? ",True,False

"How do I even begin to review this masterpiece. Best sniper game on the market for sure and especially best sniper game that takes place in the World War II era. I had really high expectations regarding this game and they broke every single one of them, whatever went wrong in Sniper Elite III like the AI for example has been fixed in SE4. I also like how Stealth is less nuanced and you can go full rambo if you so choose. I really like the overhaul to the CQB takedowns you can pull off and the revamped kill cam is just hilarious to see sometimes. I also love the new added element of environmental kills and added killcams for those kills. Gives the game a whole new dynamic to me. The best thing about this game are the realistic mechanics a real life sniper would come in contact with. Unless you play on Cadet difficulty you can't just point your crosshair at someone's head and expect a instant headshot on him. You really have to take the distance of the shot and the wind in consideration and account for the bullet drop, which is even worse on silenced ammo, and adjust your aim accordingly.  And yes there is the new Kill Hitler DLC, but I honestly don't mind this is the third time they made it. Honestly I can't think of anything more fun to kill Hitler by sniping his jewels. This is a great game, and I've waited a long time for it. For me personally hands down the best game I bought this year. 10/10. ",True,False

"Creativerse is an open world multiplayer crafting/building game. Along the same aspects of Minecraft but with a lot of extras. Obviously with the success of Minecraft (Mojang 2011) there have been tons of games that are around the same aspect of being able to build whatever your imagination can think of. Well Creativerse lets you do that. Now there's two different versions of the game currently. Obviously there's the Free to Play version but ther's also the Creativerse - Pro version ($19.99) which gives you the features to create multiple worlds and be able to customize them with additional advanced options, a glider to be able to fly through the skys as you're looking for somewhere to build, a flashlight to be able to see in front of you in dark areas, additional backpack slots (+20), +100% more stamina and you're able to claim 2 stakes for free in every world. Even without paying for the Pro version there's tons of stuff you can do in Creativerse. You can travel through a gigantic world that has wide a variety of enviroments each with creatures. Underground is just as immersive but it's a lot more dangerous than the overworld, so if you're looking for a survival challenge underground is the place to be. There's day/night cycles, weather cycles, temperature and tons of other things that make this game beyond amazing. As for building there's a blueprint system that you can follow and build amazing structures step by step as it shows you how or you can just go off on your own and create whatever your mind feels like. There's over 400 pieces of material to build with, wireless machines and complex interactions such as creature spawning, block manipulation, checkpoints and much more. If you're the type that likes to play sandbox games alone you can build your own private world and build to your hearts content. But even with a private world you have the ability to invite your friends so they can see your creations. Meeting new people and seeing amazing designs is very simple in Creativerse, you have the ability to browse through live player worlds. When you do that you have the ability to visit the world or stake your claim and make your own home in that world. Get out there, get inspired and build alongside this wonderful community that is Creativerse. ",True,False

"F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin | October 18, 2020 | [] In my opinion, It is a very clean made game. Throughout my play-through, I've never encountered a thing that it shouldn't be there. I think being super linear helps a lot in that case. Gameplay is pretty much shoot and kill then enter the next level - enemy spawn there and do the same. The AI's movement felt generic making them easy to read. I've only died 2 times (Excluding those failed grenade attempt) throughout the campaign in Normal mode. I can't say otherwise on other difficulty but it was an easy course game. The story doesn't really give a lot until it finally became clear by reading through massive hundred journals scattered around the game. It sometimes wasn't fun reading those but at least it picked up half the game that it makes me intrigue and engage with what's happening. I've never actually played the first one and this one make me want to check it to see what I've been missing. Overall experience is a big thing for me and sadly this just gave me a flat one. I knew horror is one of the main theme of this game, but I've never felt that. Jumpscape doesn't really bothers me specially with no consequences unlike Dead Space where those who freak you, can actually kill you and that makes it more terrifying.

"Well, it's already almost 300 hours since I started playing Dota 2. I think that with this journey I can already give a review with knowledge of the game. It is a very good game that traumatizes beginners, really if you come from LoL (as it was in my case), it will cost you a little to understand it at the beginning. What stands out the most in the game is the use of the items in the store. Unlike LoL there are some items that are very complex. The same goes for character abilities, there are some very good abilities unlike LoL, which are simpler. And what about the community? Well, there are some flamers who whistle if you do things wrong, but if you already have knowledge of what to do, that flamer son of his mother will calm down and even praise you if you do things right. From my point of view, it seems like a well-made MOBA that really deserves to be better known, unfortunately Valve does not promote their product as much as Riot games does. PS: Maybe there is a Riot cpp that reads this and let me tell you that I also dedicated their hours to LoL, and I even have m5, m6 and almost m7 masters with various characters. ",True,False

"-Unique gameplay mechanics which makes it standout from usual traits of this genre of games. -Great environmental,graphical (effects, textures and model) design. -One of the most if not the most gore-filled, violent and revolting game of this current gen. -Free for existing owners. -Superior art direction conveying the gore and horror petrified halls of hell. -Tons of unlockable content,modes and different endings. -Improving on almost all aspects of its predecessor. -fairly priced for the content it has to offer -Gameplay tends to become repetitive fairly quick. -Transparent storyline. -Unevenly placed checkpoints. -Choppy voice-acting. -Limited interaction with the vast environment. -Fickle stealth mechanics which causes too many sudden death encounter progressing throughout the game.   The story itself follows a lost soul trapped in the depth of the horrifying hellscapes without any memories of his former life. Slowly its revealed of what's the protagonist's backstory, he was a ruler of an ancient land who made a Faustian bargain with the Red Goddess. In-story, he is referred to as both Nimrod by the Goddess and other trapped souls some of whom still have their memories, blaming the protagonist for them being destined to hell because of his rather negative acts he performed while alive. As the protagonist wanders through the wastelands of hell, he discovers a possibility of escaping through the aid and guidance of the Red Goddess. Eventually, he travels to the Red Goddess' lair to learn how he can be set free from the torments of hell. The game itself is a mix-match of Puzzle, Exploration and Stealth. The first person perspective is highlighted mostly during the exploration. The environments are highly detailed with hints of finding notes and other important things that leads you to a better understanding of what's going on. The wormhole of gore gets worse with every step people mutilated beyond recognition, pools of blood etc. Uses of tools provided such as torches opens new paths but attracts more enemies. Stealth here is the most highlighted mechanic which gets u through most of the later stages. Camouflage by hiding in mounds of corpses is crucial to the game's progression. Puzzles in particular is pretty easy mainly consisting of finding and delivering items. Certain types of enemies can also be avoided in a puzzle like manner with the help of the aid of notes and some others by yourself. Overall sometimes it may come off as all shock, and no substance. The take on hell is amazing, but the underlying gameplay can become frustrating.  You will begin your journey as a tormented soul within the depths of hell, without any memories about your past. The special ability to control people on your path, and even possess simple minded demons, gives you the necessary measures to survive in the extreme conditions you are in. By exploring the hostile environment and interacting with other weary souls of the hellscape, the protagonist will soon understand that there is only one way to escape from Hell, and it will require meeting the mystical Red Goddess. By summing up notes the storyline and dialogues are revealed. The narration slowly hints at some lore with the eventual progression and slowly reveals the ""Big Picture"". Definitely the best aspect it shines the most. Brilliant depiction of hell and its miseries with the help of Unreal Engine 4 delivers on a solid experience. Great sound design and music, even though it isn't much noticeable some dialogues don't sync up which makes the voice acting feel a bit lacklustre. The game itself is very demanding maybe because of the absence of optimization but didn't notice anything huge while running on a system based on (gtx 1050 ti,16gb ram) frame rates are pretty solid too. Nothing sevre got bought to my attention. Safe to say no major bugs in this incarnation. Agony is a game not made keeping the mainstream gamers in mind so it's obviously not everyone's cup of tea. But for those willing to experience it the game ensures a solid horror experience. Overall a reasonably priced horror experience. ",True,False

You can experience a lot of adrenaline when you run away from a maniac or during stealth :) I really hope that the developers will not abandon the project, will add something new, set up a normal balance, remove bugs and cheaters, and introduce some kind of penalty system for the liver (and then a little bomb from such teammates). Bottom line: It is because of its originality, despite some (no less important!) Shortcomings, that the toy is definitely 10/10! :) P.S. maniacs who don't kill you and give you a little boost - thank you! :)) ",True,False

"All developers should pay attention to how to make a real remaster, a game remade without losing its essence and with improved quality. What was already good and innovative for the time just got better. The gameplay is incredible, easy and simple. I thought it would be complicated because on the N64 lever you had to open your hand and have thumb control on the analog and I particularly liked playing on the keyboard more than on the joystick. I'm reliving my glorious childhood vacation days when I stopped all day to pass the level, look for keys and the best: I didn't have the memory pack so I had to keep the console on to be able to continue the game. I hope you will do more remasters like this and launch Turok's sequels. I dropped all my '' current '' games to be able to dedicate myself and managed to get addicted again and when I reset (again) I will reset again and again and again. haha 1000/10 ",True,False

"Miyazaki once again presented us with a great game that expands the boundaries of the soul-like games we are accustomed to, the battles have become more dynamic, you get incredible pleasure from the endless clang of swords, more or less normal stealth has appeared, and the character can jump almost anywhere the level design allows. The plot is now served directly. The entourage of Japan in the 16th century is transferred to all 12 out of 10 and is slightly seasoned with mysticism. The landscapes in the game are simply breathtaking. There is no more variety in weapons, but many different skills and tools have appeared in the prosthesis. Bosses now have 2-3 full HP strips and the ability to inflict a fatal blow without completely destroying HP if you quickly knock down stamina on a boss or a mob. I hope that Miyazaki will continue to delight us with masterpieces. ",True,False

"Good day! Today we will explore the recipe for the perfect game. Write everything down, and don't forget any of the ingredients below when making your own cocktail. And be sure to respect the proportions! Today's cocktail slogan will be: So let's get started! First, take the largest container and add the main idea there. In our case, we will add the idea of a cyberpunk future. Then add the most important ingredient there - dialogues. No perfect mix is possible without it! Dialogue is like wine. They need exposure, so it is better to take care of their preparation in advance (at least 3 years before cooking). Due to all the complexities, this is an extremely rare product. Not all craftsmen are able to create all the conditions for perfect dialogues. Then pour everything into a shaker and mix, but do not shake. Then take a small container and add some visual to it. Don't forget that the main idea of our mix is cyberpunk, so you need more bright colors, especially in pink and purple shades. Next, add a handful of characters. And spice it up with music. The quality of the latter is also worth paying attention to, because it is its diversity that will make the cocktail more sparkling and tasty. Pour everything into the same shaker and shake well. You can also add any amount of carmotherine to your taste. The more it is, the higher the immersion. That's it, the cocktail is ready! Hope you master this recipe and make your own perfect game. And if you cannot get all the necessary ingredients in perfect condition, then there is always the opportunity to try a ready-made cocktail! You can always try this mix in the bar And also at the moment another recipe for the perfect cocktail that can take you away is being developed. But that's a completely different story ... Well, as a bonus, I am attaching you a short recipe for mulled wine, which will ideally warm you in winter. ",True,False

"AND TODAY FRIENDS THE GAME IS OFFICIAL OUT OF EARLY ACCESS ON THE BASIC, CONGRATULATIONS !!! PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS, better known as PUBG, is a game that everyone has heard of. I think that there is no such person who would be indifferent to her. The game is either loved or hated. It is a fact. After playing quite a lot of hours (350 at the time of writing the review), I decided to make my final opinion on this, in my opinion, a masterpiece. First, it should be recalled that the game was already released on the basis of 12/21/2017 (this is like a gift for us for the NEW YEAR). Since the game was released today, it is characterized by all sorts of bugs, lags, and so on. The most important thing is that we are constantly working on the game and releasing updates that adjust the game, making it even better. If we compare what was from the very beginning with what is now, then tremendous progress will be seen. Let's go further. What is this game like? She is, as I wrote at the beginning, a battle royale. We and about a hundred other players are thrown out of the plane onto the map, where we are to become the king of the island. There are enough loot places on the map, so there won't be any problems. The game will not be able to drag on for a long time, since the blue zone will not limit the playing area after a certain period of time. Airdrops are not uncommon in the game, which is good news. The presence of transport (which, by the way, is sufficient) will facilitate your movement around the island. We have the option to play solo, duo or squad. Well, if you are a terminator, you can go solo against squads. You can play both in the first and third person. Next, I would like to analyze certain points in the game that, in my opinion, are of interest to many. one). Cheaters. Yes, there are cheaters in the game. How much without them. BUT! Having played more than 350 hours, I met them at most ten times. The reviews in which the authors write that ""AAA READERS DO NOT GIVE BENDING NORMALLY, and the game is given 0/10"" are surprising. You just have to accept that someone has crooked hands (that you cannot hit from 250 meters) and a hard hearing (that you cannot hear opponents in the house). 2). Is skill important? Quite a difficult question in this game. Of course, the ability to play here has a place to be. The reaction and some kind of tactics in the game are important, and you should not forget about attentiveness. You can constantly run and kill everyone, but there will be a person who will just sit in a bush ... 3) Optimization. Ooooh, this is my favorite topic. Guys who want to comfortably play on medium games in a game that is already based on computers with 460 vidyahy - naturally it will lag with you (although it will start, you can play on low ones with drawdowns - I checked, and then you will have it not playable). At least a Min card GTX 1050 requires our favorite game. The game requires good enough hardware. BUT! The game is being optimized (and it will be pretty soon, and you and I can play at 60fps stably). On tests it gives out significantly more FPS than in the usual one. With the global update, I think the number of players will increase as they can play on their weak PCs. 4) Cases and more. There is an in-game currency with which we buy caseics, which we can sell or open. And there it all depends on the randomness. Personally, I opened about 20 cases, didnt come out in plus, but didnt go into minus either. The game pays for itself completely. So, if you feel sorry for 900 rubles, do not regret it. You will multiply this amount several times. Well, for now, that's all I would like to say. The review will be edited as it comes out and updates and new thoughts come into my head. The review was written on 12/21/2017. 10 out of 10. ",True,False

"Similar to factorio but cheaper! It is a game that puts the requested items in the big square in the center. You can carry your items on rails, cut them, combine them, rotate them, and color them. You can also combine colors. I have a problem with my eyes and it is difficult to distinguish the colors, but it was very helpful because it displayed some additional characters. Although it is a rail, I will lay a line by dragging the mouse. It is difficult to do this all the way to the end, so I would like to make heavy use of the copy and paste function that is released from the middle. To use copy and paste, points will be accumulated by continuing to put in the items required for unlocking, so you can paste by consuming those points. It's a good idea to put this item in multiple lanes early to earn points, as you'll need to spend more points to do large-scale copy and paste. Especially in the final stage, it is mostly copy and paste. There are no enemies like factorio, so it is recommended for those who want to rearrange their imports in a peaceful world. ",True,False

"Awesome game, but why didn't she hook me up for a long time: /. The first gta I had contact with, good gameplay, graphics, sound, story, etc., even very good.

Of course, if someone works / has money like ice, let him buy it blind, but for people who do not have that much money, I suggest waiting until the game drops to PLN 60-80, because in my opinion it is more or less worth that. For these 120 zlotys, I suggest you buy two new wolfensteins and foreign insulation (or whatever you want), but I recommend against gta for this money.

"Very little Spoiler warning ahead: LiS: Before the Storm was quite interesting. I loved the game as Max and it became so much to me. I cryed so often and the characters who where created felt like family. I Pre- Ordered this game because i was flashed when I heard I get to play more of the Story and know a bit more about the whole. So i was completly flashed when i played the first Episode. So full of nostalgia and see all the old AND finally Rachel was a complete burst. I played the 2nd Episode and it was ok. I was able to kiss the new character i truely love and wanted to know how these Storys matches together. Then today the last Episode came out and it took quite a bit but today was the day and I couldnt wait. It took me round about 3 hours and im kinda confused. The Ending wasent the Ending i wanted and as in the Original we only had 2 ""END- Desicions"" wich was normally completly fine but this was different. If you just look at the game itself I can recommend it. If i look at the game out of my perspective: I can still recommend it. But it wasent the last thing i wanted to make out of this whole Story and Im left out now with a bit of an unsafe feeling wich wanted more and didnt became it. Maby thats all why im feeling not quite fullfilled with the last episode. But none of the less its a fantastic game wich every ""Real Player"" should play and think about decisions, life and much more. If you read till now i gotta thank you for reading and i hope you will love the whole Series as much as I do ... :hearth: ",True,False

"10/10, would Mod again! But in all seriousness, I've clocked in nearly over 300 hours on this game alone - more than any other in my steam library. Yeah, it's bugged up to the eyeballs, and the occasional CTD can get a little frustrating, but I personally blame it on my inability to load Mod orders correctly, lol. There are plenty of fixes out there; and considering the sheer mammoth size of the modding community, there are countless ways to renovate, enhance and completely alter the experience each play through. You get out what you put in with this one I'm afraid. I wouldn't recommend it for those who don't care much for modding, aren't too savvy with mods, or simply don't want to sink the time and effort into finding and installing them (correctly). The stability of the game may suffer for it (at times), but if you've set up your mods correctly the collateral damage is pretty unnoticeable, and will only rear its ugly head from time to time. Some mods even exist to minimize/fix certain problems that exist in the vanilla game, or as a by-product of other mods. Suffice it to say, if you're inclined to buy this game and you find yourself enjoying the experience, You'll be spoilt for choice, and replaying the game over and over again to sample all that the game, and the modding community, has to offer!

"In order not to be considered quite rich Buratina, for a start. Oculus Rift CV1 with two Touch controllers I took in the fall of 2018 for. He also had to take a third sensor for 3.5k on Avito, so that he would not lose me when I turn my back to the two front ones. The total is not that expensive compared to current prices for the Rift S () and the newfangled Valve Index (frenzied). I crank everything to the maximum and everything flies on Core i7 7700k, 16 Gb RAM and RTX 2070. Although the game swears in the menu for too high settings. Perhaps there was no point in twisting everything to max, since the resolution in the Rift CV1 is FullHD for each eye. In new helmets, the resolution is already higher, but I will not see these textures. It plays great with two Oculus Touch controllers. Unless, due to the location of my sensors, they did not see my hands quite close to the floor, which is needed a couple of times in the game when defusing mines. But this is solely due to the configuration of the furniture in my room. And so shooting, reloading weapons, soft pleasant vibration, everything is available. To move, of course, is better with the stick, I have long been accustomed to VR and I do not feel sick. If you've played VR games with hand controllers, there aren't many new things here. In the same Robo Recall, there were shotguns / rifles hanging from the back, then Alix takes out ammunition from his backpack. The game takes quite a long time, I went through the game for several evenings for three hours per call, the batteries in the controllers were already dead, I had to change. If you played Half-Life 2 voraciously while still on a pirate, where after each download you had to write ""ai_disable 0"" in the console so that NPCs would not be dummies, then you do not need to explain anything. As soon as you start to get a little bored in the second half of the game, Jeff appears. Cool guy, I advise everyone to meet. And just brilliant game design. The same map at the zoo is beautiful.

"is a mediocre puzzle, platformer and skill game that was particularly inspired by. Alan wakes up with a memory disorder in an underground research center. He has to pass 25 tests in order to demonstrate and improve his cognitive and physical capabilities. He is accompanied by his doctor in charge, Darwin, who always finds motivating and calming words. But Darwin is targeting another character trait of his patient and tries to determine this with the help of decision-making questions, but also secretly to shape it: Allan's morality. The game consists of three acts that build on each other: The first part functions as a tutorial. The clear components of the puzzles are explained to the player in ten test chambers. As with there are opaque and refractive cubes, lasers and light bridges. Up to the tenth level, the tests are extremely entertaining and make you want more. Unfortunately, the last chamber of the first section is unnecessarily frustrating as it is made up of different horizontal levels and a crash within target range results in an almost complete restart. The positions of the dice and activated switches are saved, but the parkour you have covered must be rerun. And that's exhausting. Very exhausting. Because a small misstep, a wrong jump or a reaction that is too slow inevitably leads to Alan's death. In a puzzle game, comprehension should be in the foreground and not skill or responsiveness, otherwise it would be a platformer. Unfortunately, the majority of the 15 main tests that follow builds on this type of level design. Only occasionally do you come across mental challenges, mostly it is timing and a high level of frustration that are addressed and put to the test. In addition, another functionality of the game will be introduced in the last two tests: weightlessness. Regrettably, the tests for the underlying solution are simple, but extremely nerve-wracking to perform. The shop page advertises through or inspired gameplay, but this statement does not apply to the main part of the game. The last chapter is similar to: Breaking Out of the Research Complex. The protagonist has to flee via the abandoned offices and common rooms of the employees and via hidden parts of the institution. This chapter has been implemented excellently and revised, at least for me, the numerous negative experiences from the main part. Between the tests, Darwin puts the player in a moral dilemma. There are only two possible answers, but both lead to the imaginary sacrifice or rescue of people or groups with different characteristics, which are partly obstructive and partly essential for the survival of humanity. These decisions do not influence the game, but are evaluated and compared globally at the end of the game. The high quality voiceover is in French and the subtitles are in English. Bugs almost never exist and irreversible actions are always excluded. In detail, however, it can often be very tricky when moving or placing cubes. The accuracy of the jump and Alan's indolence are also in need of improvement. The game is a bit expensive because after four to a maximum of five hours - with 100% unlocked achievements - the credits can be seen. Overall, I finished with mixed feelings. On the one hand the story was interesting and the first and last chapters were varied. On the other hand, the main part was made more difficult by skill tests and the playing time was artificially stretched. The fact that the game was developed by only one person and that his passion for puzzle games is clearly recognizable, finally moves me to a limited recommendation. Because if you are looking for profound puzzles and intellectual challenges or want to tackle puzzles in peace, you may be disappointed. ",True,False

"I recently finished this game, after playing the first one and the expansion packs. I already called Half-Life 1 one of the best games i've ever played, but this one is my all-time favourite. The game is not even nearly perfect, it is perfect. It's action packed, it got GREAT graphics, animations and more for a game from 2004 and it even got moments which were truly epic. Unlike the first one, this one offers more puzzles, greater and more evoirments and more action and even a little bit of horror in it. You not only fight against one enemy, no you get to fight headcrabs, helicopters, City 17 Guards, zombies and more. You kill them on your own creative way around the middle of the game when you get more weapons like the Gravity gun, one of my favourites. It let you travel to so many cool area's and not only on foot.. You get to travel to there with for example a car. Absolutly amazing. It's one of the few games of 2004 that offered so many beatiful content and realistic fighting. For example, around the end of the game, you get to control rebels against City 17, they help you, and give you health if needed. Sure, it got it's bugs, sometimes it also brought me motion sickness.. But that didin't stopped me from playing it. The ending and the mysterious G-Man makes me wanna' play Episode 1, which i surely will. It's only 9 bucks, so if you want to spent that money on a epic journey with enough replay valaue, then go ahead. Buy this game, a game which i think, never gets old and always will stay one of a kind. ",True,False

"A popular comic strip, followed by an equally popular television series, and finally, video games. And if Survival Instinct, to put it mildly, did not succeed, and the glorious No Man's Land for mobile phones is not so well known to the general public, then The Walking Dead: Season One adventure game has earned a good reputation among both Walking fans and ordinary players. Later it got a sequel called The Walking Dead: Season Two, and the third season is gaining momentum with might and main ... Wait, is this a game or another series? Let's start with the fact that ""play"" is a loose concept. And Telltale Games is quite rightly reproached for stretching it so that there is nowhere else. Natives of LucasArts ate a whole kennel in the production of quests, but in recent years they have made a noticeable bias towards ""interactive films"" based on famous works. They hit Back to the Future, Jurassic Park, Fables, Borderlands, Game of Thrones ... even Minecraft! This cup has not passed and ""The Walking Dead"", and this is not surprising. Where, if not in the atmosphere of a zombie apocalypse, can a truly strong dramatic story and vivid characters unfold? The comics and TV series have proven it quite well: time is behind video games. And Telltale kicks in - at least when it comes to the script. The rest of the game will be able to count only on the fingers ... And in the first ""season"" things are not so bad. We are even offered a kind of choice of difficulty - either with highlighting key areas for interaction, or without it, as well as without showing the reaction of other characters to the actions of the hero. They assure that the story will develop the way the player wants, and not someone else. Look, they say, we have a real game! It can even be replayed to make the story take a different course! The impression, however, spoils a little already in the first five minutes. The branded inscription ""'The name of the character' will remember this"" pops up in a dialogue with a policeman doomed to inglorious death and zombification already in the prologue. ""How will he remember this?"" - an inexperienced gamer racks his brains. Don't worry, this is Telltale, its the way it is. Better to shoot the poor fellow as soon as possible and enjoy the story. Already in the first episode of Season One, you can be sure that the developers are masters of storytelling and staging. Wonderful live dialogue with perfectly matched voice acting. The verified angles of the game camera, dynamics, even the QTE scene - everything is done at the highest level. Former history teacher Lee Everett, even though a convicted criminal, instantly disposes, and this impression only grows stronger as the game progresses. The authors immediately put on the main character a ""personal conscience"" - an eight-year-old girl Clementine, whose parents went on vacation from the suburbs of Atlanta to Savannah at the wrong time. Four hundred kilometers is not a problem when buses run, but the sudden zombie apocalypse ruined everything. Lee himself has no reason to stay in place, so why not help the little one left without parents? Traveling through the agony of the zombie virus in Georgia isn't going to be easy - and it won't be. In history, you can find fault with a number of points, but only if you really try. The main plus is that it is not boring at all and always keeps you on your toes. Even at the moment of rest, the player does not leave the feeling that soon everything will go to hell - and, of course, this is how it happens. Telltale Games is not bound hand and foot by budget constraints for actors and sets, so nothing stops them from maintaining the right pace. If in the TV series on The Walkers the second season the characters spend on the farm and the viewer dies of boredom, then the second chapter of Season One, in the same rural surroundings, is so terrifying that the hair stands on end all over the body. Developers and contracts with actors loved by the general public are not associated, so no one is insured against sudden death, regardless of gender and age. There are pluses and minuses in this - on the one hand, the required level of drama is maintained, on the other hand, such techniques become boring already at the end of the first game. Should you go through The Walking Dead: Season One and its sequel? Yes, if only in order to touch a peculiar phenomenon and personally appreciate the history. There is not much to play here, well, at least there is something to see. The main thing is not to relax with a bucket of popcorn, because the ""walker"" from the scenario bushes can jump out completely suddenly, forcing him to convulsively grab the mouse and poke the Q key. Tea is not some kind of serial! ",True,False

"Blasphemous is a pretty good 2D platformer that combines a small part of the game mechanics of old / modern games like Blades of Vengeance, Dark Souls, etc. The plot of the game tells the story of the brave warrior Penitent, who fell under the curse of an endless cycle of death and rebirth, called the people of the land of Kvstodia - the Miracle, now the main character has to break this vicious circle in this devout world saturated with a perverted religion and the atmosphere of Dante's Inferno. The gameplay of the game is simple, where you have to run through non-linear locations stuffed with secrets and hordes of different monsters, along the way find / collect bottles of bile (analogue of estus), various artifacts that give certain effects of protection against damage or resistance to different elements of magic, so you need to adapt to different type of enemies and locations, as they contain traps and dangerous obstacles. For killed enemies, ""tears of redemption"" will be credited, this is the local currency (analogue of souls) for pumping a sword and additional combos, buying expensive artifacts or keys from secret locations, also for ""tears"" you can restore a bar of zeal, it will also allow you to use various magic, well, do not forget about the altars (analogue of bonfires). Of the minuses, if anyone decides to play through the keyboard, immediately change the control layout, because some genius set up the controls as inconveniently as possible and did not add such Y and H buttons to the control - rewinding the text in the description of items.

"I recommend the game rather than not. But there were many things I didn't like about her. The game has beautiful locations - a forest at the beginning of the game, chapters with railway tracks and a sawmill, but a lot of the game will have to run in complete darkness or in continuous fog. Pseudo-open locations in the forest are made looped, i.e. where you don't go, you still go out to the camp with a tent (and so on in 4 chapters), until you find the plot item and you can go further. The last 17th Chapter is very much drawn out in terms of duration. VERY long wanderings through the looped corridors in the witch's house. It was safe to cut it in 2 times. Monsters - 2 types, the first are killed by the light of a flashlight, the second are immortal, you need to bypass them and not look at them. Boring. To get all the achievements and endings, the game must be completed 2 times. One of the achievements - Pacifist (don't kill a single monster) is better to get in the second playthrough. And this passage is obtained in complete darkness (you can use a camera with a night view, but this is not like a flashlight) and with your nose buried in the ground.

"One Shot Three Kill A continuation and at the same time the third installment of the action game struggling with the life of a sniper, re-released by the Polish developer CI Games, where production costs reached as much as PLN 40 million. The place of action was planted in Georgia in an open world, in the realities of a local conflict, the Kremlin has become the main terrorist object in which we eliminate dangerous enemies behind enemy lines. Our main character, which we control, is Jonathan North. In addition to the main mission, our hero has his own case to find his younger brother in Georgian territory, we support the local resistance movement in exchange for information about his brother's place. The open world in the game is large enough to overcome the roads, the creators offered us the opportunity to explore the areas thanks to the vehicle that we drive through most of the game in order to find outposts and other key places, in addition to fast traversing, fast travel anywhere on the map can help us thus we will find such a travel point. The story missions are quite longer than the predecessors, and we perform side missions in various combat possibilities and we make our own decisions from three paths as a long-range sniper, as a ghost during silent elimination thanks to suppressed weapons and be a fighter by carrying out frontal attacks from a heavy arsenal. In the game, a skill system has been added to the three paths that we will take, we will unlock helpful accessories for our sniper faster healing or more ammunition, but the creators at this point did not try too hard and went the easy way. The weapon we have at our disposal is huge, there is a camera with a bullet as well as modifications in the workshop, adding silencers, creating cartridges, larger magazines, we unlock various sniper rifles with considerable recoil power, assault rifles that help in close combat with a large group of enemies and a reflex bow that we will get in one hidden cave, I recommend a shotgun for close range. We have everything available in one hideout from three individual maps, here we prepare everything before the mission, what we take with us and get to know the mission plan, in addition, we get orders to eliminate the most dangerous criminals sought, for which we get interesting money loot. For extreme navigation conditions, we have been equipped with a sense of a scout on the basis of a detective mode, finding traces and a drone that helps us find enemies by tracking them and showing the right path, in addition, in Georgia, a few challenges with a drone are not enough, but a nice toy for finding interesting discoveries . The graphics work on a modified CryEngine graphics engine, using the potential of our computer configuration, we will be satisfied with the maximum graphics settings from the beautiful mountains in Georgia with a daily cycle and the sunset weather, in technical matters the game can sometimes throw us to the desktop, but the optimization has been very well improved .

"In the near future, integrated by AI, people will see the world through augmented reality. Nathan, who lives in the trafficking of illegal hardware, finds his lover, artist Jay, disappearing when he wakes up in the morning. What was waiting for Nathan to go out into the neon glittering city to find Jay? ADV set in the cyberpunk world. The main flow is that the player becomes the main character Nathan and travels to the future world with illegal hackers, outlaws, and low-tech cults in search of his lover Jay. The point-and-click method is adopted as the play system, and the main character Nathan is made to perform actions such as ""examine"", ""speak"", ""take"", and ""use"" by clicking an object on the screen, and uses items on the inventory. While solving the mystery, the story develops. As for solving the mystery, it is a little difficult, so it is necessary to carefully check Nathan's monologue, the behavior of the characters, and the journal. Play time is 8 to 10 hours. The progress is linear, but there are differences in the achievements that are canceled depending on the options. A cyberpunk dark pot game that is extraordinary, good or bad. ""VirtuaVerse"", which has the atmosphere of ""I tried to cook a rare masterpiece of ancient and modern east and west named"" Cyberpunk ""in my own way. Come on!"", I think that you will choose a person. This work intentionally shuts out players who came in with a light feeling, such as the old-fashioned point & click method, the future world of pixel art that seems to be made by a sane person, and the heavy metal style synth sound that disturbs the peace of mind. To do. If this ""VirtuaVerse"" had been a compromised work by a weak developer, it would have been swiftly removed from the market, but don't worry. The passion that can be said to be the excess of the creators who fill ""VirtuaVerse"", its momentum like that, is unrivaled by about 100 cyberpunk ADVs. It can be said that this is the uniqueness of this work. Again, VirtuaVerse chooses a player. Still, the intense heat emitted by this work will attract a daredevil player like a trap light. Satisfaction above the price range was obtained. I recommend it. [GOOD]  A unique story, direction, and world view. A mystery-solving gimmick that brings depth and surprise. -Synth sound that sticks to your ears and never leaves. Very high level Japanese localization. [BAD]  A story with a sudden feeling due to insufficient explanation of the world view. Solving a mystery that cannot be easily solved with no hints.

"I think for an online game that is trending for the first time in a long time, ""I hope they get Halal, they will reach larger audiences. I can make up the sentence. You ask why? Because Fall Guys is now stale, a production that succeeds in finding a gun after falling on the island and bringing a different breath to the games of trying to kill the nation and be the first. Fall Guys, who slapped the popular battleroyale rush of recent times, which does not contain episode design and gameplay depth in any way, actually tells us that you can go out of duplicate games. Yes, when you look at it, the logic is the same in Fall Guys. The goal is to stay to the end. But Fall Guys does this by making the elimination matches out of 60 people, making them the finals and choosing the winner. And this, along with it, gives the player a taste of many different game modes. Our game is a physics-based game in its own right, although not as much as a Human Fall Flat. With its tracks and games bouncing off from the Wipe Out competition, the potato kids in the sweet land of candy combine with very simple and easy to adapt gameplay. In this way, it manages to appeal to everyone, from young people to adults. With its many different game modes, it reaches a level that other battleroyale games cannot reach. He does not bore him by making the player do the same things, on the contrary, he puts a lot of different fun games and tracks in front of him. With its simple gameplay logic, it enables the player to adapt to the game in a short time. Since it finds a match immediately, it is a game that can be tried again and again. Actually, this part is a part filled with my personal ideas because the game does not have a big problem in sight. It is only sometimes possible to encounter server problems or minor bugs in some tracks, but aren't these the indispensable problems of every online game? Although it is a new game, I can add that they are also few in number. But once in a while, it is possible to come across cheaters (flying balances) in matches. This can sometimes miss the flavors after staying until the end. Personally, I don't like the soundtrack of the game, so I close and play the music. It is a matter of preference, but the extremely sweetish visuality of the game is also the kind that makes people hungry. Its bright colorful universe can also tire the eyes in long games. What Should Mediatonic Watch Out For After This Time? We congratulate Mediatonic for this outstanding success and thank you for saving us from poor quality productions that we cannot even call games. They caught a very good audience, but this game is a game that can survive only if it can update and renew itself constantly. This game requires new game modes, sponsorships with brands, new tracks. Otherwise, after 1 month, he can live the fate of For Honor. Now we live in a world where everything is very instantaneous and nothing is permanent. Therefore, if this game does not require innovation, it will exhaust itself very quickly. Finally; Among the online games I have played in my life, Fall Guys may be the one I played with the least anger. Compared to other platforms, Steam finds its price very affordable and I think it deserves that price. But of course, if you are one of those people who think that these inexhaustible bigoted, cartoon or animated productions are made for children, stay away. You can continue to live in your closed little world :) I wish you continued success Mediatonic. I hope you will be a cute game that reaches fortnite, pubg levels Fall Guys .. ",True,False

"Pretty Neko is a hentai title of the puzzle genre, which portrays in its art a character of the Neko style. It contains a total of twelve levels with puzzle images to assemble them correctly, however, the game is quite short and takes about 20 to 50 minutes to complete. The game does not have much difficulty in itself, because there is an option to move any piece from one row to another without having to move one by one, something that is not very common in games of the same style. In addition, there is also a censorship support, in which the player will need to download a free DLC that comes with game, to unlock the arts with adult content. Pretty has instrumental music with a very relaxing aspect, but unfortunately it is quite short and after a while it becomes quite repetitive. The mouse will be solely responsible for performing all functions within the game. In this way, Pretty Neko serves to target a specific audience and in a funnel way, due to the fact that it presents more specific content. Apart from the two negative aspects mentioned above, the game is able to successfully fulfill its proposal to be a simple puzzle with good arts, which can be easily recommended to the appropriate audience over 14 years old.

"This game is simply a gem it is a masterpiece. It's a game that didn't catch my eye from the beginning, but I decided to give it a try because I had heard their OST before that, ufff, is beautiful. The truth is that I exceed all my expectations of this genre of games, I normally are shooter games but this was my exception allowing me to open the doors to other similar titles. This game despite being a player you always feel accompanied, you immerse yourself too much in the story and it is very emotional. If you are very sensitive, it may even make you cry sometimes even laugh. In short it is one of the best games I have ever played. And its DLC is very good, I recommend acquiring it even if it does not connect directly to the story if it has a certain connection and too much action. And I loved its gameplay mechanics, it was the best and how they connected the action with its OST, uff really, it's the best I've played so far. Games like this have not been made for a long time, this game really touches your way of thinking and makes you think and ask yourself many things. And in the end, the message that this work of art leaves you is something that is presented in the real world in all its growth, something very cruel and something very beautiful too, but which is nevertheless our harsh reality. == SPOILER ALERT == * Note: Once you are playing, you need to worry about the ships. The most broken ships from my point of view are the auto-heal and offensive heal. Farm them on the path that is by Emil's house and you will have a ship of auto-heal 6 [14] and offensive heal you get it by passing the mission of the little robot that is under the bridge that connects from the ruins to the market going down from the waterfall from the forest you will find it very hidden.

"The Final Exam is a side-scrolling action game that allows up to 4 players to co-op and knock down creatures with melee weapons and guns while exploring the stage lightly. The first thing I liked about playing was the variety of melee attack combos and the exhilarating Bokosuka action. For example, after hitting a few enemies on the ground, you can float the enemy in the air with an upper attack, hit a few shots with an Erial and throw it in the air, and then shoot the floating part further to make a beehive, and a combo like Devil May Cry You can enjoy it. However, the true value of this game is a score attack that utilizes a unique combo bonus. The feature of the score system of this game is that if you attack without being attacked by the enemy, combos will accumulate and bonus points will be pooled more and more. Isn't it normal to get a high score as a bonus if you earn a combo without being attacked by the enemy? You may think that the final exam combo bonus miso is that the bonus score is only pooled until you press the bottom of the cross key to collect it, and only when you press the bottom of the cross key is it counted as a bonus score By the way. In other words, even if you defeat the enemy hard and earn combos to pool 1000 points and 10000 points, if you are hit by the enemy without collecting it, it will become a bubble of water. It is safe to collect bonus points diligently, but if you do so, your score will not increase, and if you accumulate too much and make water bubbles, it is meaningless. The bargaining of where to collect bonus points makes this game even hotter. By the way, the default setting is to automatically collect this bonus score. Please play with the manual collection setting to enjoy the score attack more. It's fun to compete with your friends in Coop play, and it's fun to aim for the top ranking in solo play. It's a game that can be enjoyed by one person as well as those who want to play Coop games with friends. ",True,False

"Many players, like me, are older, and many games can't be played anymore. After all, life is already not easy, so why bother with the game, so hard. But we love to play games and we need leisure and entertainment to adjust our lives. What should we do? Or the working people, who are usually busy with work, can only take a few breaks during the day, and have time to play when they return home from get off work. They can only stay away from the game of liver explosion. What games are suitable for this mainstream group of people? The idle game is just for the two needs, which came into being and gradually became popular. Recently, the epidemic in mainland China has been raging, the statutory annual leave has been postponed, and the traditional way of visiting relatives and friends has to be cancelled. Many players stay at home and are worried about how to pass the time. This type of game is really a tool for killing time. The graphics of this Endless World game are exquisite and the cartoon characters are also very distinctive, especially the optimization is excellent, and the configuration requirements are not high. I also indulged for a few days and found it very fun. I recommend it to everyone. Friends have paid attention to this game these days, and exchanged their experiences. In view of the lack of strategies for this game on the Internet, I will go back and write a little bit of experience and experience in the first few days, hoping to help novice players. , Take some detours and show your ugliness. To enter the game, first follow the novice guide to understand the general gameplay and game mechanics of this game. It is better to take a closer look when you have time. It is best not to omit it, so that you can get twice the result with half the effort. This game is similar to other idle idle games. The character will find the way automatically without the player controlling the map. Especially after turning on the Gaia Shield artifact, you can also turn on the automatic casting function, which is even more convenient. Normally, as long as you make good use of the equipment and gold coins obtained from the map, make the best use of it, synthesize the equipment in time, improve attributes, and the output from the map can support you to pass the map. For the players in the early stage, the game is not difficult. , You can play comfortably without spending money. Daily rewards are abundant. It is recommended to go online every day to complete daily tasks and remember to receive the activity treasure box. Please note that this game is quite special. The daily refresh time is set at 9pm Beijing time. The elemental restraint relationship of this game is: attribute restraint can cause 1.5 times damage, and restraint can only cause 0.75 times damage. The attributes of mercenaries are clear at a glance, and the writing is very clear. The attributes of the protagonist are related to the artifacts used for switching. The cataclysmic swords commonly used in tracing maps are fire fighters, Windrunner's Feather is a wind-based shooter, and Gaia's Shield is an earth-based tank. There are many ways to get diamonds in this game, and the benefits in the game are OK. At least monthly card players or even zero-krypton players can play. But the less you recharge, the more you have to plan carefully and you can't waste precious diamonds. If you are not a monthly card player with a lot of recharge, it is not recommended to go to the mercenary card pool to draw a special draw. Although this game mercenary is very important, many five-star mercenaries are very powerful, but the utilization rate of diamonds is too low and not economical. In this game, the tenth company of the inn only has a 4-star guarantee, and the feedback from the old customers of the 30th company only gives the guaranteed 5-star mercenary, which is really not cost-effective. Uh, except for the European Emperor. It is recommended to stay away from the inn in the upper right corner, and go to the store in the upper left corner to buy magic spar, upgrade the protagonists artifacts, open more advanced artifacts, not only can get rich daily income-daily free gift packs, each artifact can also unlock many new Function, see the new part in the artifact to understand. Secondly, every time you choose Time Reversal, there will be a 2-hour limited-time flop in the upper left corner. The first time is free, and the next flop requires diamonds. It is recommended to spend diamonds here. For players who don't recharge a lot, Gaoxing's useful mercenaries are all obtained here. Remember to refresh the shard pool with 20 diamonds before the flop. After the flop, you can no longer refresh the shard pool. At least refresh 2 useful 5-star mercenary shards and then go to the flop. Mercenary professions are divided into six types: tank, warrior, mage, auxiliary, archer and assassin. Because of the game settings, although the recent update added 10% damage to other melee occupations except tanks, it is still difficult to guarantee survival in the BOSS battle, and it is impossible to use mercenaries to cast skills and position, so Assassins and fighters in basic melee combat are rarely used to open up wasteland. As for tanks, they are rarely used. Generally, the protagonist is asked to switch Gaia's Shield to be a tank, which is convenient for players to manually operate to interrupt BOSS skills with control techniques. In addition to the protagonist in the game, you can also bring 4 mercenaries. The mercenary lineup can be divided into three types, one is the wasteland lineup, the second is the fast map lineup, and the third is the PK lineup. Different lineups have different mercenaries. Although low-star mercenaries can also increase their stars through the evolution in the training, the initial low-star mercenaries are still much weaker than the high-star mercenaries. Most of them have evolved to 5 stars and become other high-star mercenaries. The evolution of dog food. For the novice land reclamation, it is recommended that the protagonist switch the Gaia Shield artifact to make a tank. You can interrupt the BOSS skills, and all others are remote, mage, support, and archer. If your long-range mercenary is not good, you can bring an extra tank, such as the 5-star tank Warnier, which will be invincible and will be sent to you the next day. The best regular lineup of novices during the pioneering period: If you don't have Cassandra, you can switch to the 4-star mercenary Lily, and the healing ability is also very good. Pandora, Hornibel and Huiyue Fox are also common, but because they all have wonderful skills, they are more used for PK, and their control skills are unpredictable and unpredictable. Currently the hottest lineup: The protagonist switches the warriors cataclysmic sword artifact, and then sends 4 15-level sources. The skill reverts quickly, and it is melee. Parkour is the fastest to pass the map. Please note that this game can play the same mercenaries. If you don't draw other powerful mercenaries, but draw two evas, then get 2 evas at the same time. In addition, many of the skills of mercenaries in this game are not instant, and they have time to read. For example, Warnier's ultimate can only be invincible after 2 seconds. There is no universal lineup, and in many cases, a leader or opponent is needed to target. In addition, what is written here is the current strong lineup, which does not mean that the game will be changed in the future. If you are still stuck and cant beat the boss at the bottom of the level, you can see if your equipment has not been synthesized in time, the attributes have not been added, the equipment and attributes are behind, or there is a blue color on the right side of the boss in the UI at the top of the game interface. ""!"" button, you can click in to see the attributes and skills of the BOSS, and then according to the attribute restraint principle set by the game, use the artifact of Xiangke to deal with it. If the BOSS skill is too strong and you can't stand it, you might as well operate it manually to interrupt the BOSS skill. If you still can't beat it, you can wait until the map is brushed to the powerful blessing tower, and get the powerful buff before going to the boss to fight to the death. Not yet? Then click on the ""Blessing of the Moon"" hourglass at the top of the interface UI to see if the bottleneck has been reached, and the difficulty has been increased too much. If there is still room for energy, you can brush a little more equipment and gold coins on this layer, and then look for it. BOSS revenge. At present, the ""Offline Push Off"" function is available in the game. Click the settings on the right, and after entering and selecting to turn on, sometimes turn off the game, take a break when offline, and go online later, sometimes it can help you pass the level. There are three copies of this game: Founders Treasure (Equipment Copy), Brave Dungeon (Mercenary Copy) and Legendary Golden Forest (Gold Coin Copy). Because it requires two items, rare teleport stones and ordinary teleport stones. The treasure of the foundry also requires rare teleportation stones, so it is only recommended to hit the brave dungeon. The mercenary fragments given here, 100 fragments can be used to synthesize mercenaries, but the mercenaries need diamonds to draw cards, which is the most cost-effective. Do not rush to play the dungeon at first, wait until you are about to reincarnate, so that the various values have reached your peak, then play again, fast and good, to ensure that you pass the level. When you finish brushing the rare teleportation stone, you can't enter the mercenary copy, and then go to the gold coin copy. The gold coin copy only needs the ordinary teleportation stone to enter. Although this game is called an idle game, it actually requires some operations. Especially the few obstacles that novice players encountered in the early stage, and a few plot BOSS, need a little manual operation to clear the level. In fact, to put it plainly, as long as you know the rules of the BOSS skills in this game, you only need to practice more later, and practice makes perfect, and there is no difficulty. Most of the elite monsters and bosses in this game are there. Below the UI interface, there is a yellow rage bar, and there are two blue flames beside it. As long as the yellow bar is fully charged, the yellow rage bar will be cleared. A red guide bar appeared again, and the skill began to be cast. Some special plot BOSS, this kind of big move damage is amazing, basically can kill the character of the novice player in seconds. The way to deal with it is to find that the yellow rage bar is full and empty, and the red casting guide bar appears, promptly interrupt it with a skill that can make the boss move or stun, so that it is safe. It is recommended that the protagonist choose Gaia's Shield, the artifact of the tank. The control skills are many and the CD is short. The ice girl at level 270: Pay attention to the black water circle of the big devil next to you. You will die if you go in, so you can't get in more and more. Instead, it's better to pull out and fight. You can let the protagonist choose the archer artifact, press W, which is the 2 skill hook, to pull the BOSS out, then switch the tank artifact, press E, which is the 3 skill, rush to the back of the ice girl, and then switch the archer artifact, and use Q, which is the skill 1 This will be foolproof. Blue Fat at level 330: Highly damage AOE skills, switch tank artifacts, and interrupt when cast. Or switch the archer artifact, hit more long range, cast AOE and use skills to hit far. 450 level fire dragon: switch the tank artifact, do not pay attention to the fire dragon skills, pay attention to pull the monster to the side or the rear, do not let the dragon AOE skills hit the back row. Every time the fire dragons yellow bar is full and the red bar is cleared and the red bar is used to cast a skill, it immediately interrupts it with a skill of the protagonist. The shortcut key is Q. So as long as you can hold back and don't use a skill at will, you can still pass the level easily when the fire dragon uses a large move and then interrupts it in time. Sometimes the small skills of the fire dragon will also read the article, just pay attention to the distinction. When the reading bar is cast, the yellow rage bar will be cleared. There are many small skills in hand exercises, such as switching artifacts at any time during battle. When the protagonists blood volume is critical, his ultimate is awakened. Everyone knows to quickly order blood. Indeed, being a wolf can not only suck blood and increase the attack speed, but also reduce the anger of surrounding monsters. But when pulling the BOSS, the tank artifacts are switched, and the tank attack speed is too slow, even if you wake up, you can't suck up the blood. If the protagonist is not under pressure to survive, you can switch to the warrior artifact first, and then click Awaken. The attack speed is very fast, and a large amount of health can be restored. When the awakening is complete, switch back to the tank artifact to pull monsters. By the way, during the awakening period, only the basic attack can suck blood, and the cast skills cannot suck blood. There is a bug when switching artifacts during awakening. Another example is that the protagonist has eaten a lot of damage and has problems with subsequent survival. You might as well switch the archer artifact and quickly use the Q and E skills to shoot back the leader, and then you can maintain a safe output distance, which is better than being killed and lying on the ground. You can explore more skills on your own to increase the fun of the game, so I wont list them all. Generally speaking, there are two types. One is the average attribute type, which can be upgraded to the top with one click, so that the protagonist is a cylinder warrior, a versatile type. The second one I highly recommend is that after the early basic four-dimensional attributes are added, the main defense attributes are added, and the attack and life are supplemented. The remaining toughness and crit are not or less. In this way, the protagonist is cultivated into a real tank career, and the meat shield is resisted, the survival of the subsequent output is guaranteed, and the output is only alive. After all, in this game, even if the BOSS is violent, the damage will not be too explosive, and the main defense effect is immediate, and most situations can be easily dealt with. As for the time reversal, as long as the time reversal challenge rewards are exhausted, the blessing of the moon is also exhausted, and it is very hard to pass the picture. If you often get stuck in the picture, then go bold. Of course, if you are particularly budget-conscious, you can check the elegant gradient (purple wine) reward in Time Reversal, and try to get it before you turn. And there are many reversals in time and many flop opportunities. For microkrypton players, this is the biggest benefit for getting high-level mercenaries. Don't forget, remember to prepare at least 1,000 diamonds for the flop before the reversal. By the way, go to the dungeon and the arena before turning. At this time, your attributes reach the top, which is the best time for this day. The other thing is to put the best equipment into the time storage box and don't waste any resources. By the way, remember to spend 150 diamonds every day to buy a time key. Purchase from the ""+"" sign in the lower left corner of the time dial in the time reversal interface. Of course, in the token exchange refreshed in the store every day, remember to buy time keys with flowers. Soon you will be short of keys, the time reversal dial is dissatisfied, it is impossible to reverse the light. As you all know, if you want to forge gold in this game, you first need to open a gold illustration book. So in the game, it is difficult to synthesize gold equipment by collecting equipment from monsters. How to get the gold outfit? Krypton gold bosses can naturally go to the store-adventure store-equipment box to buy diamonds directly, but it is not recommended here. Here is a way to make gold equipment for civilians: Click on the equipment in the lower left corner, and then click forging to make it. Someone wants to say, I just dont have a gold outfit illustration book, so how do I make a gold outfit? Dont worry, take your time, you first forge 3 green equipment, then 3 green equipment into blue, then continue to forge 2 blue equipment of the same name, 3 blue and then purple, and finally 3 purple Pretend to be golden so that the golden equipment comes out. Please note: Be sure to choose the same level of equipment to forge. Otherwise it can't be synthesized. In addition, in the early stage of the gold equipment, there is no need to think too much. Usually, it can be synthesized according to the current drop of the level. Also need to pay attention to is that forging a gold armor, the magic iron to spend money is expensive, don't play with low-level equipment, magic iron is a scarce resource. If it's not a heirloom with particularly good attributes, don't spend too much magic iron to upgrade. It's far better to wait for 10 levels and forge high-level equipment directly. Finally, lets talk about the recommended order for improving combat power: Moons Blessing (Hourglass) level, more artifacts, artifact level, mercenaries, and equipment at the end. This refers to the key indicators that can permanently increase combat power. The current problem with this game is that there are often bugs in pathfinding, and then it prompts failure. Although there is no loss after failure, it will automatically continue, but it hangs well, and it is always unhappy. The other is that the server often freezes, which is even more unbearable. I hope developers can fix BUG and improve server quality. In the future, when launching events, while considering paying players, we can give microkrypton and zero krypton players more benefits and development space, so that all players can enjoy the fun of this game, and everyone is happy. Okay, this is the end of this guide for newbie players. If there are any unclear points, you can go to the official group of the game and ask the big guys. The group number can be found in the help on the right side of the game. In addition, there will be some small benefits every month, such as the redemption code of some small gift packages.

"Hello, I'm Charley Tank and if you don't know who I am then I'm a Tester for nanos the creator of JC3MP. I have been playing this wonderful game Since before the first public beta it has come a long way since that day. I have spent countless hours recording videos on the test server I also Recorded the Trailers for the Beta release and the Steam release so I'm quite Familiar to this wonderful game. This is a video of scrapped trailer footage some made it and some didn't but it was all so fun to record and I would do it again over and over 10 times. I actually have a lot of good things to say about this Multiplayer Mod because I got to play with it before the public not just because of that but I made a lot of new friends becoming a tester  (Thank you Protato) I have sacrificed a little to gain so much and for that, I have to Thank Nanos & Square Enix. I have tested the Multiplayer Mod on 10 different computers with 10 totally different settings from an i5 3570k with a single GTX 660Ti right up to my latest build an i9 7900x with a 1080Ti the same results on every test sure there are some bugs but nanos works on these with every new patch and it's getting better and better the game is playable and stable this is a live stream I did on launch day. I have done over 47 videos on the Multiplayer and have never had so much fun in all my life on Any game as I have had on Just Cause 3 Multiplayer. I play on Gaveroids Just Cause 3 Multiplayer server not because they put my name in the game but because that's where all my friends play I appreciate everything nanos has done for me if your a real Just cause 3 fan like me try out the Multiplayer you will see what kind of mayhem you can cause there are so many different possibilities so many ideas, road trips - cargo plane air force -  mountain climbing - you name it you can do it. I have been stunting trying a lot of different things on the Multiplayer The DLC servers are the best mech fight with 50 People? what are you waiting for stop reading this and hop on the Multiplayer? You can't have this kind of fun on any other game but Just Cause 3 Multiplayer. I have well over 1500 hours on Just Cause 3 Single player I will get triple that on the Multiplayer. I recommend this to everyone let's game. ",True,False

"Review-story: Honestly, I don't even know where to start. [These games came into my possession thanks to the quarantine period, and also because of the boredom of playing shooters myself.] Let it be concrete: for me the whole series of ""The Witchers"" is an absolute masterpiece. I started with the first part, sure that I will not play the other two until I buy new equipment, because the famous Radeon 520 was frying to me at the sight of a bonfire in W1 [of course on the lowest ones], but the whole adventure turned out to be so addictive, so great that I decided to go the other two parts on a fucking pathetic 10fps, where it was really going to get a stroke from how it all cooked ... I don't regret it. If you are looking for a game that is great in terms of plot, because I personally touched me more than once, much more than the famous Life is Strange. Why? Because everything here comes out so naturally, many decisions can have completely unpredictable results, it is ... Life, real, not by force. It shows everyday, heart-breaking dilemmas against an unusual background. As Bloody Baron said, ""Nothing is black and white."", The character that is the best example of the non-linearity of this piece. At first thought to be a bastard, it eventually caused a torrent of tears. And surely, if you want to smash with monsters and feel strength, improve your dexterity in various tactics, combine them with potions - you will find a huge amount, nothing stands in the way, but when you get over it; you will see that you missed about 80% of the value this game conveys. It cannot be described, and I do not want to explore the technique itself. Is it enjoyable? Of course. Is it easy to use? Hour and you navigate efficiently on the interface. To sum up: Such a good plot, exquisite, even perfect humor, and landscapes that we will be able to visit on our silent companion Potka, the absurd and unique rescue of the ""princess"", the poignant history of Janek's pile, a lot of difficult choices, their sometimes brutal consequences, over which I have been wondering for a long time in terms of their rightness and the attachment that I have built to the character of Geralt is something that I would buy with full awareness, even without a discount, for the PLN 100. And I am stiff. ",True,False
"In the Game of CK III you win or you die... Ok, most probably you will die quite often anyway, but as long as you have a good heir your dynasty will live on, and thats what counts. With the improved Legacy bonus for Dynasties even more now than before. This is actually one - of quite many - improvements they have included in the third installement of the game. From the lifestyle focus trees for each character to the Dynasty, Faith and Culture trees, you have now much more influence on how to develop.. which also is easier to understand and plan imo. Also down to every character attribute they have much more influences on many decisions ingame.  Besides this, the gameplay is very much like the second part of course, you make Marriages and Alliances to rise in the world. Then you die by gout or someone murders you.. through accident.  The things which are a bit annoying so far are a bad overview at the map level, especially in warfare.. often you dont even see your armies anymore, because the map view changed for some reason.  The warfare itself also got a bit improved, with specialised troop types, which add to your normal levies. The overview is in part the biggest problem, since the news snippets plop up and go away again, i have not seen much options for changing them.. or reading older ones. Also windows close automatically, when you click a news which makes you open them up again and again. Otherwise regarding bugs the game seems mostly stable and in working order, especially for this fresh stage of release. The music can be still much improved (in comparison to CKII), but is not annoying at least.  Conclusio: Looking forward to many more centuries of crusading ;) - No, honestly, if you liked the second part, get it.. and even if it was too complicated, you can risk a glance, since in my opinion it got quite a bit easier to understand and transparent. Score 9/10 ",True,False
"even with its changes and problems related to combat and its artificial intelligence, bugs in the scenario and other details that can be corrected with updates, the defects present in Skyrim do not take away from its strongest points: the feeling of freedom and the narrative. The possibility for you to create any type of character and behave differently in each game, the side stories that are also huge (Example: Thief's Guield, The Dark Brotherhood) and that show other facets of a gigantic, complete and cohesive storyline, make The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim on the list of the best RPGs you may have played in your life.

"I like it. A well-told story, albeit without much intrigue. You are watching the narration from the side, in fact, are not any of the specific characters. Because of this, the emphasis shifts to dialogue rather than action. And they are spelled out perfectly, with a grain of seriousness and humor. The camera work and transitions are generally great. Despite the flaws in the graphics, what the operator creates from angles ... mmm, a fairy tale. Every dialogue is felt. Everything is built on conversations, in essence you just sit and listen to the chatter of the characters. You are not even an outside observer, as if you are not in the world of the game. And for this a lot of information is pronounced ""as is"", without explanation. Also, the narration is quite equal, there is no protagonist as such, there is only a general storyline. That is why they do not reveal much about the characters; it is like a set of small scenes of ""everyday life of the necrobarist"". Because of this, the story seems unsaid, a lot of things happen as if behind the scenes. It is impossible to fully feel the joy or sadness of the characters. All this would look great in the form of a movie, without these freeze frames in the form of the need to press the space bar. But this is still a game, and I would like more immersion as a hero of the story. However, this is a lack of a narrative format, so not for an amateur. What is really a miscalculation is the lack of voice acting. This is what the game sorely lacks in character voices. It's just like watching a movie without a voice, but with subtitles and music. This format requires voice acting. In general, I advise you to try, definitely do not waste your time. ",True,False

"Initially, I was disappointed in the map being largely covered by an inhospitable mountain range. Still, it's content and scenery made up for this. Elsweyr continues the adventure that started with the Wrathstone DLC and is noteworthy for it's introduction of the Necromancer Class, making this expansion highly desirable. Elsweyr features several new recipes across the crafting portfolio including jewellery, effecting Homestead, trading, combat - which indicates a respectable amount of work detail and creativity. The main quest continues into the Dragonguard DLC. Upon it's completion a bloody great host of quests becomes available.  There's another free house that's unlocked through the year long story line. You will have the best time zerg-ing the enormous dragons or World Bosses here.  To summarise, highly recommended for fans of the Elder Scrolls - get into it. ",True,False

"I don't know if to call this a game, rather it is a journey through the feelings and thoughts of the developer. Sometimes it is shown metaphorically, other times it is said directly in phrases like ""You need to give up"" or ""Your work is never enough."" The purpose of the game is to show the player the sadness and burden of the developer, and in my opinion, it is not a bad attempt. Although the use of Unity is something basic, and there are levels that are not entirely clear Awkward Dimensions is an experience that is worth a couple of minutes, and without a doubt any player who knows how to enjoy a somewhat sad and well-set experience should try it.

"shadow of war .. Our distinguished game that takes up 110 GB of space. Human ""Lord of the Rings series author of Tolkien did you put in the game?"" does not ask: D anyway, let's move on to our review. the game is visually successful, I liked the graphics very much. the farther you look, the better it looks. personalizing the character ispositive. The captain thing is also extraordinary, especially when you are running from one place to another, they jump up and bring you to the kundi and go to war from there puts the man in a good mood. but I wish their orcs didn't write in Scottish comedian mood. Think of the orcs trying to stand up in the middle of the war: D you get it. This breaks the dark theme of the game a little. you suddenly feel like you are in the hobbit universe, not the lotr. The fighting mechanics of the game are simply EF SA NE. I don't even remember which game was the last time I had such fun while fighting. You can make fun combat by improving your character with various upgrades. Riding the dragon and caragor is an extremely enjoyable event, I cannot help but mention it. Especially in this kind of big map games, mounting is very important for me. Executing with caragor, climbing walls, smashing orcs' heads etc. is a great pleasure. I can vouch that you will enter after you finish the game just to relieve stress. let's come to the story .. I can't call it perfect, but it has been adapted properly for the lotr universe. The finale did not satisfy me at all, let's see if the new game will come, how will the story of ranger talion continue? If you still haven't played this great AAA game at this price, I strongly recommend you to play it, if you are interested in the medieval and lotr universe you will definitely love it, or you will start to be interested. :) 8.3 / 10 ",True,False

"10tons (the developer) is showing some really good business practices with Tesla vs Lovecraft. They took an amazing but outdated game, Crimsonland, and instead of ""reskinning"" it and releasing it with Lovecraft themed monsters, they built upon their successful game design, creating an even smoother gaming experience.  Tesla vs Lovecraft has a decent sized campaign (3 hours) which is a series of small maps you have to clear of monsters and can be replayed on 2 higher difficulties while keeping all of your upgrades. Instead of a vast empty space like in Crimsonland, here each map is small and packed with obstacles some of which destructible. This allows for a more tactical gameplay because you can lure the monsters in tight alleys or corners and release Tesla's electric wrath upon them. Your ability to teleport and call in a mechanical suit allow you to plow through your enemies and quickly disengage when you're outnumbered. This makes the gameplay far more dynamic and a bit more casual (on the first difficulty at least, it becomes much harder afterwards). The DLC is adequatly priced and fully optional as it is mostly aimed at hard-core fans. ",True,False

"Hood. I just wanted to tell you one thing, I really liked this installment, seriously, it is the most sensational I have seen so far, it is a work of art, without exaggeration, it is something that, at first glance, could have been done by Da Vinci himself, his genius can be noticed from miles away, not even the worst of bad tongues could say that we are not faced with a majesty seen only once in a thousand years. I have not seen in all my years of life something of this magnitude, it causes you an indescribable sensation, an immense joy despite not having done any action, a rare feeling to find but fantastic, something like what a breeze feels like in a hot summer, or see the joy of a child when opening their Christmas gifts, or simply be with that person we love so much. Do not listen to the gossip who criticize incessantly anyone who does not meet absolutely all their expectations, just believe me and all those beings who consider and admire such a great work of art. There will always be people who are going to tell you that what you did has no value, but the secret is to ignore them, those people would give anything to have created something as magnificent as what we are seeing. Just as God in his infinite wisdom created humanity, or as a man in love creates a poem to express his deepest feelings, or as a painter creates a work of art from some time that even he does not know, this is how it was created this excellent game, in the same way. It may seem that I am exaggerating, I repeat, but it is not like that, not even close, I would exaggerate if I said that I am not before an admirable, incredible creation, of a beauty of biblical proportions. In fact I am so delighted with such a contribution that I decided to write a poem about it, it is titled ""my eyes thank you"", here it goes: - ""My eyes thank you, since they have been caressed, my feelings praise you, since They have been awakened, my heart idolizes you, because you have made him dance, and my being says thank you, for such a delicious delicacy, I will be waiting again, for you to share your joy, even in the middle of the night, or in the most radiant day Just keep creating, creating until your hands are heavy, so I'll tell you again, my eyes thank you ""-. I hope you enjoyed my poem as much as I enjoyed writing it, I would say that you enjoy it as I enjoyed your magnificent game, but I don't think there is a situation in the world that resembles so much happiness. To finish being brief, I wanted to thank you from the bottom of my heart, one in this life encounters situations that make him feel bad, he thinks that he is not going to find anything good these days and suddenly he comes across something like that, it is difficult to decide where one is going to leave its positives, and in fact it is already tiring to report most of the games that you see lately, I feel that many are created by trolls and people wanting to annoy, nothing to do with what we are observing, here one thinks everything On the contrary, he simply sees it and says to himself ""there must be no place on this earth, neither in the sky nor in the underworld, nor in other planets, galaxies or universes, where it is better to leave my points, I have found the real Atlantis Although it is not a physical place, its simple beauty is enough not to hesitate to make such a comparison. "" Sometimes I wonder how much skill or how much skill it takes to be able to make a creation of this nature, sometimes I compare myself with the creators of beauties like this and I think that I am not even a simple human being, next to these creators I I feel like an ant in front of an imposing elephant, like a pawn next to a queen, like a child in front of a superhero from these comics that you like to read so much. Sometimes I look up to the sky and ask ""Can I create something that, at least, can be compared to this beautiful game?"" ""Can I ever be as cool, creative and talented as the creator of this? ""What must one do in this life to achieve such genius?"" But no matter how much I ask and ask, I never get an answer. Sometimes I dream that I wake up and in front of me, next to my bed, there is a game like this, but in my dream it has something different, the creator is me. Yes, I know it seems crazy, something as glorious as this cannot be created by a simple being like me, but we must not forget that it is only a dream. If I could make a wish, that would be that this game never leave the store, that future generations can observe its magnificence and be filled with happiness with what they see, filled with happiness, madness, passion ... If all games of the world were like this, there would be no wars, there would be no pain, forgetfulness, sadness. We would raise our heads and singing a song in unison, like a choir of archangels we would say: ""I believe in tomorrow"" ",True,True

"I finished the game in 4.5 hours. You can finish in this time unit roughly because of the sections. I can say that the atmosphere of the game is absolutely magnificent. So much so that it puts you in different emotions throughout the game and actually processes the history of humanity as subtext (we don't have any tools at first, we fight with animals, there are animal traps because it is a hunting period, then we meet people, etc.) After you finish the game, you may want to play it again and again. The reason why our character in the game is a child is that Limbo, Hz. The place where children who lived before Christ and died before they could be baptized. According to Christianity, Limbo is the 1st floor of hell. There is no fire, but only emptiness. Those children will remain in this space forever.

"Left 4 Dead 2 is a zombie survival game, but with no focus on horror, you can choose between four characters, Ellis, Rochelle, Nick and Coach. Regarding the arsenal you have about 14 firearms, 11 melee weapons and 3 different types of desserts available. There are 7 game modes and among them there is the ""Mutation"" mode, and it completely changes the way you would play the normal campaign, speaking of the campaign in total there are 13 campaigns available to play with the characters from the second and first games . It is possible to play the campaign alone in a local game or to play online with randoms which I DO NOT recommend since in most games I tried to play with people who were not my friends it didn't end well since most were making fun of the game of others or using hacks to disrupt other players. Left 4 Dead 2 is a very good survival shooting game that I highly recommend. More if you want to play with four players instead of playing alone with three bots call your friends or play locally with a friend on your computer, which is a possible thing to do in this game and many people don't know.

" ets. WHERE IS MY FILE! Never. Even if drunk and really want to, do not pump speed, never. Pump up the speed  you will pass the last level. (Spoiler the most effective module is green lasers) And so the game is not bad - tauver defchik - like a space run - we have a ship - there are places for turrets - choose turrets and a set of weapons to complete the mission - but everything rolls down to FUCKING GREEN TURRIES. And tactics played more in space run and there were more turrets and additional support modules justified themselves. And here is where the blea file is - with such a game there should be a file so that you finish the game for yourself. I end up with 5 and +1 in the hope of a sequel. If it will be me the first who will buy. Results 6 from 10 And the game is unfinished - not in terms of bugs - but in terms of balance.

"A mixture of farm and RPG. A surprisingly good mix. For a long time nothing made me so happy and did not make me forget that I still have some business to do. On the good in order: This is the end of the heading why it is worth buying it, let's move on to the impression. The first thing we do is create our protagonist. Here the first ambush awaited me. I always had a problem with the choice, especially in games, to choose this path or that, use or save until better times, a red jacket or that black one. So, there are a little more than 100 shirt options here. I skipped them all three times and already cursed the creator (), but still choosing something black, I went in search of adventure, and to be precise, quitting my job, went to study my inheritance ... So, we get an abandoned farm, can you imagine what it is? Overgrown by the most ... uh, tomatoes. With a bunch of stones and other delights of rural life. A set of tools is given to help. And everything. EVERYTHING. Now hammer yourself into a stone, into a tree, bite into this soil and make your farm become something beautiful, not a house abandoned many years ago. In short, we, friends, are in a gigantic ... mine. There is a lot to do, at first there are few nishtyaks, and the pleasure simply cannot be measured, seriously. Coupled with a nice picture, no soundtrack, the author wrote down an incredible variety of activities, a nice village, cute characters, as well as tasks that help not to get stuck and give an understanding of what to do next. As a result, I advise everyone and everyone, except people who hate pixels. ",True,False

"This game from Sigma Team is an easy to pick isometric shooter.  Despite it's age and graphics, the fun factor is great.  Also, the small but effective improvements you can buy allow you a bit of customisation  on the gameplay style.  Different weapons ARE different, and you have to be careful with reload times.  Hordes and hordes of aliens come to get you. You can also use the environment on your favor, like doors , corridors ans such.  Sound assests are good. When you mix aliens with explosions, grenade launchers and mayhem,  it gets really really rewarding. Usually this game along with others (from Sigma Team) appear on bundles,  or heavily discounted not only on steam but also in other sites (i.e. Indie Gala).  When you are bored, and want a quick and mindless session you can fire a chapter , or even play a survival session.  Play it with v-sync off, to avoid some problems.  It runs on a toaster, so it's perfect for those (like me) that have ancient hardware around. ",True,False

Yeah that's all the cons. If I had to I would give this game a very nice 93/100. It's got a lot of polish added to it and it's worth every cent you put into it. Buy this, you won't regret it at all. ",True,False
"Alright, who's here because of brutalmoose? Despite his rather harsh review, my curiosity got the best of me, and thus here I am. So is this game truly awful, or is there more to the story? Let's start with the basics. Chantelise is an action adventure game that's somewhat of a JRPG as well, for reasons we'll get into soon. A quick gander might lead you to think that this is a long-lost PS1 game, judging by the graphics and sound. However, Chantelise is actually an indie game from 2006, back when the indie scene was far less established. So whether by necessity and/or conscious design choice, the overall style is technically only one or two generations old, which makes it rather unique today. I find the 2D-like sprites and low polygon count quite charming, and the accompanying sounds are the same way. It's just something you don't see often, as it's not ""retro"", nor is it realistic. Fortunately, the horrible pixelation you see on many PS1 games is smoothed out, and the audio quality is decently better as well. The hand-drawn characters are pretty good, though nothing super special. All in all, save for a couple frame drops, Chantelise feels like a slightly remastered game from the late 90's, and that's pretty neat. So then, what is this tale of two sisters about? In short, older sister Chante has been turned into a fairy, and so she flies alongside her younger sister Elise as they look to undo the curse. They come across a caring shopkeeper named Aira, as well as an enigmatic fortune teller named Elma, among others. From there, the sisters venture through four elemental-themed dungeons (plus a final place) as they discover the truth behind their legend. It's certainly not the most profound story, but it does work well through its own simplicity. There's plenty of whimsy to be had as well, particularly on Chante's behalf. She's always making wisecracks, while Elise balances her out with sweetness. I think the localization is especially good at making this work, as each of those one-liners are delivered just perfectly. It really speaks volumes how a competent translation can do wonders. I was invested in the story, even if it wasn't groundbreaking. Now for the real meat of the review: how does Chantelise play? You control Elise as she moves around a 3D space, attacks enemies with her sword, and uses Chante for magic. Levels consist of small screens with unique challenges and enemies, all with a boss screen at the end. That's where the action and adventure parts come in, though I'm not sure if I'd call it an RPG. Stats are only managed on a basic level, and there's no real progression system, save for plot advancements. The money you collect from enemies functions somewhat as experience points, which you exchange for equipment and HP levels (which you need to do often). Equipment is also gained in dungeons by doing certain tasks. It's a cool idea in concept, as it encourages you to play around in each screen, but the conditions are arbitrary, and ultimately it's better to use a guide to get everything. While these treasures are optional, you'll really need them to keep up with the game's difficulty, which is very unforgiving, particularly without preparations. Many people say this game is hard, perhaps too hard, and I can't blame them for thinking so. Some players may resort to grinding, though it'll only get you so far. You'll have to adapt to lots of obstacles in your adventure, and they won't be easy. Oddly enough, the first boss is probably the second most difficult in the game (that final boss, yikes), and it's no wonder why so many give up at that point. Another issue I had is that the camera is very unwieldy. While more manageable with a controller, it's tough to lock onto enemies and let go when needed. I eventually got used to it, but it took time, and I still had issues throughout the game. Once you can get past the issues, the game has a nice rhythm to it, but expect to mess up often. I'd say it's not for everyone, but if you can put in some effort and forgive some esoteric choices, there's fun to be had. Well then, is Chantelise a good game? To me, it was fun despite some problems. You really have to be patient and understanding with the game, which may not make it enjoyable to some people. I think the fun story makes for a good driving force to continue though. If you think Chantelise is the type of game you might enjoy, it probably is. Chantelise certainly isn't a masterpiece, but I can't help but feel it's at least better than the critics told us. ",True,False

"The Walking Dead: Season Two is a sequel to the famous adventure video game The Walking Dead. Here, too, there are 5 episodes, each of which will bring its turn in the story and a certain unraveling. Like the first part, the game adheres to basic techniques, so we have dialogues in the game, where we try to decide in the time limit for the best answer that suits us, or fundamental decisions. At the same time, the game offers the function to import the decisions you made in the first part and thus slightly affect the sequel. For those who do not have the first part or saved positions have long ago erased the story offers generated decisions. In Season Two, Clementine's influence on the current world in which she lives, both mentally and physically, is strongly visible. Clementine is now more or less ready to take care of herself.

"Quick Intro: The game is based in a steampunk medieval time. You are a Swordsman (sorry Fighter) after realising halfway through the game you are a female protagonist lol, who is wanting to prove her worth and become a part of the league of fighters and will do anything to protect her village. Graphics: The artwork and scenes in he entire game are beautiful and well designed, it may look basic but itll always want you to keep on playing and see what more monster designs, quest, bosses, and other heroes you will get to see along the way.  As for the important part the game runs very smoothly and even on laptops so no need to play worry if you wanted to play it as you wont be needing a 4k high spec computer. Gameplay: The game is designing to be half Final Fantasy and Half Yugioh. Its a turn-based game where each Character is allowed up to 8 cards, through the battle system you can use cards, to protect, boost or Attack. With many different cards and variations, the game become lot of fun as you start to explore different cards for your characters. Customising your deck to make certain characters brawler, mages, and back up dancers I mean Support. Not much else should be said as if you are a fan of turn-based and card games then I will leave the secrets for players who would like to purchase this game and explore for themselves.  Advantages: No matter what level you are at gaming, this game is brilliant for Beginners and for Advances players as the tutorial explain it very clearly how to play the game, help give you tips and combinations, so that when you reach chapter 3 you will be a professional at playing this game, discovering new combos, strategies and tactics. Disadvantages: Nothing negative to say about this game as I need to play more of it to see if there are bugs or errors in the game except you can say the game is alittle pricey for now but with Steam sales, if its low in price I would buy it. Overall: I would recommend this game is any fan of yugioh or Final Fantasy as you will have a blast and enjoy the concept of the game. Id rate this game a 8/10. Hope you all enjoy this review Peace out. ",True,False

"This work tells the story of Athena (one of the protagonists) being captured and recalling Jack's fall. The content of the game is actually memories. The event took place on the moon with low gravity, so players can enjoy the pleasure of jumping several meters. Some guns have bonuses for shooting in the air. In order to adapt to the environment without oxygen, this work introduces an oxygen mask, which is a good innovation. In addition to oxygen supply, the hood can also launch a shock, which can be launched by squatting up to a certain height. But personally think it is not practical. This work also added laser gun and ice element damage. The laser gun is not the kind of alloy warhead. I personally feel it is a rifle with a relatively high rate of fire and accuracy. The ice element is more interesting. When shooting, there is a chance to freeze the enemy and restrict their actions. The physical damage taken by the frozen enemy will increase. Occupation adds a little noise, which makes people shine, I heard that it is very interesting. But I only tried Athena, and the shield is also quite interesting. The skill tree is more team-oriented than the second generation. Generally speaking, the prelude did not reach the height of Borderless 2. The main line is shorter and the branch line is much less. The difficulty is lower, and there are fewer boss fights. The plot is not bad, filling many gaps, the addition of the protagonist's monologue is great. The original price is not cost-effective, it is recommended to wait for a discount. Players who want to play the Masterless series can try 1, 2 first. ",True,False

"Exodus has a great story that closes Artyom's saga and his fight together with his companions for a better life! The gameplay has had some modifications compared to the previous ones, but nothing that doesn't get used quickly. Its main campaign is focused on the stealth and without violence (if you want the real ending) and a lot of exploration and fighting. The graphic is beautiful, as expected, however ... that's where the problems came from! First, there is a serious problem involving Direct X 12, many crashes will happen and sound bugs where out of nowhere it disappears or ""crashes"" totally and that can even affect Windows! Bizarre!! To improve this situation it is recommended to play in Direct X 11 and this will decrease significantly, despite the 2 battles I had against the ""boss"" of the Taiga map, there was a gigantic lag that was only resolved when this ""boss"" killed him (and never happens again). Apart from this situation, in the game you will find objects and / or enemies ""floating"", when you get the car and use the diary / map inside it, your vision will go up, almost on the ceiling and to return to normal just open the diary again /map. There is also the rendering problem: on the same screen you will see the same object well rendered and another not (example: the rocks of a mountain, one well rendered and one on the other side). With all this, do not be discouraged, as the game is very good and very worthwhile, but be prepared to face technical problems that have not been solved until today! ",True,False

"Wanting to become a kungfu master but lack the physical training? Fear not, now you can become the best kungfu master ever!  One finger death punch is a simple brawler that requires only 2 keys to play (left and right). There is no complicated hard to pull off combos to memorize here. Show your mastery in kungfu by pressing the right key at the right time as hordes of enemies come rushing at you from both sides. Certain enemies such as the boss will take multiple hits to kill, while other enemies carry weapons which they may throw or shoot at you if you are not being careful. On the other hand, you can also grab these weapons dropped from your enemies to use, for example, a gun with enable you to shoot (effectively killing enemies normally outside of your melee range). As you play through the levels, you can earn gems to unlock skills, such as slowing down the time or increasing your range of attack. All very helpful to help you kick their asses harder. In addition, there is survival mode and co-op where you can play with another friend.  Overall, this game is highly recommended if you are looking for a simple yet fun brawler to play. ",True,False

"Hello guys. I just come to make a brief comment about this game, because for me it is an example of how the game industry has evolved in such a short time. Here even though many may say that it is a short and badly finished game in several aspects, for example: camera, movement and combat, it is still a great project. For those who do not know, this game is a university academic work, so we are talking about a team that is still in formation and that probably had no professional experience, but, even so, with the due knowledge, will and support of the training tools. development created this game that could really be very good with due refinement and completion. I believe that from the current state to the possible finished product, half the way has already been covered. The reason for wanting to talk about this game is just to highlight how our industry has grown, not only because of Hardware, but in the support of specialized tools, because in the past, even if you had the desire in the past, you would not be able to create a game in the high sizes or industry average, but not today, the proof is there. So if you really dream of game development, go ahead, as the path may be difficult, but you will succeed. ",True,False

"Don't laugh, the actual experience of the game is really like this. At first, the cute loli image of the protagonist Little Witch made you think that this is the Little Witch Fairy, but then you discover that it is actually a TPS (laugh). Although this game can indeed be regarded as a soul-like game, everyone is happy to call it ""the cute version of the black soul"", but in fact the difficulty of the game is quite approachable, and the difficulty curve is increased reasonably. Even if you are a hard worker in this type of game, you can believe it can be light. It's easy to get started, and it's not so easy to lose its challenge. The role system of the game is relatively simplified and not complicated, but the four types of combat magic possessed by the protagonist are all targeted (as mentioned at the beginning of the article, the magic in this game feels like shooting, just four types of magic correspond to four different firearms) , After chanting, they will produce their own unique additional effects. These buffs are even related to the decryption of some processes; the wind magic and the magic absorption array respectively correspond to the double jump and the ""reverse"" action, especially the latter. I believe everyone Friends who are familiar with the black soul understand its importance in the game; in terms of enemies, the three bosses currently appearing in the level have their own characteristics, similar to the battle in the black soul. Players need to observe and master the BOSS attack mode and implement corresponding countermeasures. , As long as the method is correct, the battle will become very easy. In short, judging from the current levels of the game, the game feels just right to play. The system is clear and simple but remains a bit challenging. The overall gameplay experience is quite comfortable. In addition, the game is also very interesting in some small details: for example, the little witch will fall to the ground cutely if she is exhausted in running or dodge state; the goddess statue corresponds to the campfire in the black soul, and the ""burning fire"" action is in this The work has also become a ""maiden's prayer""; and because the little witch is short, she will jump up and grab the lever to press down the switch by her weight when facing some relatively tall institutions. This little detail is so cute. . In the first half of this year, when the performance of domestic indie games was generally weak, a ""Little Witch Nobetta"" was born. In just one week, thousands of reviews were smashed and received rave reviews, and this praise was not only due to Chinese peoples comments on domestic products. For the support of the work, nearly two-thirds of the praise comes from overseas players. It is another miracle that the game can be sold so big even when the game is weak, but if it is not for the unique charm of the work, it may be difficult to achieve such a good result. The production team Ximeng Creative said frankly that in the past few years, the development income was almost nothing, and now it is difficult to sustain the development of funds, and now it is difficult to sustain the development of the game. In order to meet the expectations of the production team, this is also the best encouragement for them. I hope that the production team will continue to work hard, fulfill the promise to the players, maintain the current quality to complete the development of the rest of the game, and respond to everyone's enthusiastic expectations. Come on! ",True,True

"One of the games with the most cyberpunk elements at present, with humorous character dialogues to guide you to understand the background setting of the game world, and the character creation is unique! Those who like this kind of theme must play! Tips for clearing the barrage game achievement: The robot spaceship is a column and a column refreshed from the right side of the screen. Taking each column as a wave, waves 1-10 and 16-79 can be directly on the screen. The safe point in the lower right corner hangs up. For the rest of the time, it is recommended to manipulate the protagonist to stay on the leftmost side of the screen, press the attack button and do not release, and keep the midfield. Most of the time, you don't need a large displacement, just move in a small area to avoid the barrage. In the end, the barrage's hit determination is relatively loose, and only the magic wand that the protagonist little fairy rides is the scope of the determination, and the little fairy's body is not counted as being injured if it is hit. But this is still pretty hard-core. I have played for more than 2 hours to pass the level anyway. Good luck to the friends who are all accomplished! ",True,False

"Reviewers, reviewers, reviewers. How many people like to consider themselves reviewers, but talk complete nonsense about the subject of their review. Here are a few examples: The plot of the game is standard for its theme, but still very little. Pretty damn little! There are 30 story missions in total and 4 police cases, each of which consists of several missions. All characters in the game are stereotyped, they could be revealed better. However, I liked the presence of scenes where the main character sees nightmares after the next story mission. Thus, the developers show us that undercover work is not easy. The developers decided to compensate for the short plot with additional tasks. In itself, having such tasks is good. The only bad thing is that most of them are quite boring, plus they are repeated (help the cops shoot the bandits, catch up the thief, help the cops shoot the bandits again, etc., etc.). Of the additional activities, I will single out races. They are really nice, enjoyable and reminiscent of NFS races. The physics of cars is implemented here better than it was done in GTA: SA. The sensations of driving a truck, car, motorcycle or boat are different from each other. The songs on the radio in cars are excellent, you probably already know some of them, and you may bring others into your player. What is it worth riding at maximum speed on a bike with Trivium or Killswitch Engage. During my passage of the game, I encountered the following bugs: - / I got rid of the cops on my tail, but the sound from their flashing lights did not disappear anywhere. Even loading another save does not help. But a complete restart of the game saves. This is a very annoying bug or new technologies are in service with the pharaohs. - / Once during a story mission, our main character just flew into the air when he tried to climb onto the roof of a building. Probably too much Red Bull, because it gives wings :) - / Sometimes an exploded car appeared on the road out of thin air and at a low altitude and fell down. - / Sometimes the Social Status menu freezes, where you can compare your statistics with the statistics of your friends, and after you throw it out of the game (and sometimes it just throws it out of the game).

"An excellent game in the style of Cyberpunk I got acquainted with the game in 2013 and passed safely Now, after a long break, I bought it on incentive and also passed Game 7/10 The game has several types of opponents (flying, ground) and they are all deadly in their own way.

"The game in general is quite well executed, but doesn't do much renewing the genre or anything. It builds on the foundations that have been laid out for Metroidvanias, so be prepared to mark areas that you can't yet proceed through to make it easier to know where to backtrack too. Personally I'd have liked the ability to have different coloured markers (as to indicate new skills needed or just treasures). For me this was quite annoying once, since I forgot to mark a certain gate, and it was the only point of progression, which meant I had to go throughout all the maps and check everything out (I feel like this is more on me than on the game though). Besides this the soundtracks are quite basic but nice to listen to anyway and won't annoy you into turning off the sound. The environments look really nice and fit well with the rest of the style of the game. The magic feels a bit basic (and honestly strong as in most of these games) but to be fair I haven't used much of it since I prefer combat over magic. The different types of weapons are quite nice, however since it's (somewhat) randomly generated you quite often find weapons weaker than the ones you already have. The only real performance problem I encountered was quite odd and I'm genuinely not sure if anyone else would ever encounter it. I'm using a Xbox Bluetooth Controller, which means it might sometimes (temporarily) lose connection, most of the time this is just for a second, however Chasm really doesn't seem to like this. Whenever my controller would lose connection the game would slow down to being pretty much unplayable, yet recover to normal speed when the connection was restored. In general this wasn't a problem (as you don't lose your connection that much) but since my controller was apparently low on batteries it had a real problem keeping up the connection (which took me a while to figure out what the problem was). In conclusion I'd recommend buying it, especially when on sale as I feel it's worth around 10$ easily. ",True,False

"Different from the traditional PAC-MAN, this time Namco has made a very refreshing ""racing"" game. After the game starts, the game speed will continue to rise. When the speed reaches the highest level 50, PAC-MAN will become difficult to control. At this time, how to keep the speed without dropping while continuing to eat beans and killing a large number of ghosts at one time becomes a take The key to high scores. In fact, even if the handicap is familiar with each maze, he can get a good score, but the manufacturer has not penalized any cheating behavior, so the top of the leaderboard is the ""god"" record that exceeds the game's maximum score. Points are very unfair to players of normal games. Finally, I look forward to the second generation that will be released soon to bring more interesting new gameplay. ",True,False

"This review is only about Dawn of war 2 singleplayer campaign. Gameplay is very straightfoward and fast. There are wide variety of abilities and units you can select to slay your foes. Different enemies requires different tools of the trade. There are so many mixes you can combine with available items and abilities that game keeps interesting for a good time. Although 10 000 slayed orcs later you feel like you have seen it all. Boss fights are disapointing as every boss just takes 1 000 times more dmg than average unit and launches some special blast at a pre-marked zone. Bosses gets repetive really fast. Main plot and characters are well written and fits perfect to wh40k's rich lore.  I like the idea that you simple don't have time to do every mission there are available. You have to excecute missions that suits your overall situation best. Also there are usually 2 strategic assets on the map and you can only conquer one of them. There are 3 kind of strategic assets in the game each benefit different kind of boost to you. Choose the ones suits you game style best. It would have been much better if you could just upgrade your weapons with points that you get by completing missions. Now you have to constantly check dmg/stats about weapons that drops during missions and you get like 10 new weapons in every mission. Useless weapons (about 90% of all drops) you just destroy to get small amount of experience points. All this dazzling doesn't bring anything good to the game and this mechanic should have been simplyfied. CGI cutscenes looks outdated and they should have done them with live action like in wh40k: Final liberation (1997). World of warhammer 40k is still well represented in cutscenes and especially in the opening cinematic. Endless slaughter what this game offers goes really repetitive after you have seen all the type of enemies and weapons there is to see. This game is without a doubt recomended if you are a warhammer fan, as you get so much more out of this game if you know the basic settings in warhammer 40k universe. The game kind of assume you are familiar with the lore and goes straight to the ""Bom bom bom"" -part. 10 - Perfect game 9 - Excelent game, best of the genre 7 - Average game, nothing really special 6 - Bad game, avoid 5 - Painful to play, completely waste of time 4 - Failed game, unpayable ",True,False

"Do you like reading? As in, do you like any sort of literature? This game, or rather, the story in this game, is 100% a must for you to read and experience. World building at its finest, characters steadily develop and welcome you more and more into the world in Pyre. Won't say anything else about the story, because I'd like everyone to go into this as blind as I did, so let me just deal a final card about it: I have played and read a gazilion of stories in my steam and not steam library, and this one, will not be forgotten. Aesthetic and sound... it's a ""Supergiant"" game, it's common knowledge by now that their work is amazing in those departments. I like the vibrant colours in this one, and the music sets the mood perfectly, chill, with feeling, nothing wrong here, as per usual. Gameplay, it's a 3v3 football (soccer for the US peeps) with RPG elements, depending on your choice of team, you may fare really well, or just be confronted by an outright superior team. It depends on skill mostly, the AI is competent enough, and I'd recommend playing on the harder difficulties, so it provides a better challenge. The only fault I find with Pyre, is the lack of online multiplayer. Not being able to play with my online friends, knowing how fun it is to play with my ""local"" friends, makes it a frustrating missing aspect. Overall, story is excelent, gameplay is really fun, especially on harder difficulties, I highly reccomend this game with sale or no sale, although at this point, might as well wait for the discount to show up. Do you like to read? well, reader, this one's for you. You don't like to read ? Not my place to judge, but do give this one a try, it might surprise you after a while. ",True,False
"There is no person I know that would not know of this game. Many gamers that I know regret every moment that they dont have this game. Its absoloutely brilliant, the requirements of the game are ridiculously low, the point of the game and gameplay is easy to understand for anyone who doesnt know of the game. However, this is a game that you would get bored of in about 2 hours of straight gameplay. Its impossible to stream it for more than 4h, because the game is so simple. All you do is walk and shoot. But indeed this is a trully great peace to play with your friends, you cannot play this game with more than 3 friends, so that sucks, but if there would be more players at the time it would be really boring and most of players would have nothing to do. Most of the rounds go fast forward and you do not get stuck at one point or another. The game has a minimum ammount of bugs or glitches, if there are any. There are multiple gamemodes and maps for you not to get bored within a day. But even knowing all the minuses, I still dont regret paying for this game. ",True,False
"Almost everything I wrote in the Spellforce 3 review regarding the technical part applies to this game as well. With some amendments. The graphics have become noticeably more beautiful, although it would seem that it is much better, they increased the interface and changed the spell panel, added new portraits for the main character. There have been many dialogues between the party members, this is good news. There are even dialogues with mercenaries, which I have never seen before. I got used to silent dummies.) We got rid of the stupid caravans that shamelessly robbed randomly appearing homeless people and now, when an outpost is captured, all resources in the region are immediately shown. The situation with the troops is the same sad, the obscure pile is small. So, what did it cost the plot units marked with soldiers to add these same portraits of soldiers from the barracks? Again the same rake with the complete absence of portraits. One of the main villains did not even deserve a portrait. What's wrong with the developers.) They are sawing a new game, but they cannot release a small patch to fix TWO NON-WORKING ACHIVES. My thoughts on the plot. As a whole, the plot is noticeably weaker than the previous part, apparently hitting his head in attempts to correct the technical part, they completely scored on the script. There is a large spoiler ahead. I recommend it to those who are impressed by Spellforce 3. Run in strict order, the plot is strongly related to each other. ",True,False

"  9/10 Takes a while to get started but the end is worth it. After going into Death Stranding completely blind having avoided every published content about it from the day it was released on the PS4 and not knowing what exactly I was getting myself into, I can only say that if you have absolutely no interest in a story-driven game, don't want to pay attention to what's going on, and watch all the cutscenes as well as listen to all the dialogue then I'm not sure if this game is for you.  In my opinion, the story is amazing but requires focus as well as patience because it takes a while before things get rolling, unfold, and take shape. This isn't a game that will spell out the entirety of the plot for you right away, it takes some effort and most of all patience to get there, and personally, I've enjoyed the ride and the end was definitely worth it. I know there are quite a number of people who seem to like to label Death Stranding as a ""walking simulator"" but I firmly believe that those people have either never played the game themselves, don't understand what the game really is about and what it has to offer, or the type of game it is is simply just not for them. Is there a lot of walking around in the game? Yes, there is. Is that what the entire game is about? No, it's not, far from it actually. Personally, I'm someone who genuinely dislikes fetching quests but for some reason, in Death Stranding, I never once felt bored, annoyed, or frustrated while taking trips back and forth between locations in order to fulfill deliveries and quest-related things to continue my journey through the story. It's also not just simply running from point A to B and back because the game throws various things your way that you have to adjust to. You have weight to manage, check what type of equipment you may need, plan a route to take, figure out the dangers you may run into, whether to go by foot or take a vehicle, and plenty of other factors to take into account for the best possible outcome and your trip to go as smooth as possible. Another reason why labeling Death Stranding as a ""walking simulator"" is beyond me is that walking simulators focus on environmental storytelling and exploration without an actual threat or enemies. There are plenty of threats in this game. From MULEs, human NPCs who want to steal your cargo, to areas filled with creatures called BTs which is short for beached things, to actual boss fights. Of course, when you start out, your main focus is on being stealthy because you don't get the means to fight back right away which could also be something that puts people off because it takes quite a while for things to unlock but I think this is a much better solution in this type of game than immediately throwing every possible equipment one could ask for at the player right from the start. You need to work and put in some effort to get something in return which, in my opinion, definitely isn't a bad thing at all. Gaining people's trust, not letting them down, and working towards a common goal is what unlocks possibilities and gets you closer and closer to the end of your journey. Visually and auditory, Death Stranding is absolutely stunning. The cutscenes are great and add a lot to the delivery of the story. The voice acting is really well done and the soundtrack is absolutely beautiful and pleasant to listen to. 50+ hours into the game and I'm still not tired of it. I haven't played a game in quite a while that kept my interest for this long, especially after already having finished the main story, I hardly ever go back into a game after I'm done with the main story. To me, Death Stranding looks amazing, sounds amazing, plays amazing, has amazing characters as well as an amazing story and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who really likes story-driven action games and has the patience to push past a slow start.

"To begin with, I am a huge fan of Borderlands. I loved the first, spent over 500 hours on the second. What about Pre Sequel? Meh .. At the beginning I believed in the bitch, I saw in Pre Sequel just a big DLC of Borderlands 2 with new characters ... The hours of games go by and I have come to certain conclusions. (SPOILER WARNING) /! \ Before reading all this I advise you to watch the trailers above on this page, you will better understand what I mean for those who have never touched any of the Borderlands. The positive points: -New characters, therefore, with new gameplay, new skill trees, customizations, etc. -The gameplay is divided into two phases. In an oxygen-free environment allowing immense jumps but which gradually consume your oxygen and in an environment with oxygen where the jumps are reduced but where the fire element weapons acquire their full potential. -Lots of easter eggs like in Borderlands 2. A reference to Star Wars, Pink Floyd, Mario, Daft Punk etc .. -New vehicles, new maps to explore, new enemies to destroy, new bosses to exterminate. -Borderlands The Pre Sequel is HARD. When I compare to the two previous opus, I find it more complex yes, the enemies resist well, do more damage which generates fights which are technical and of which more interesting. -little DLC. Again, compared to Borderlands 1 and 2, Pre Sequel features little DLC. I also recall that Borderlands 2 has 10 add ons without counting the skins. -A JETPACK. And we can play Claptrap..wow what more can we say. -Grotesque punchlines, cult lines and lots of humor with Borderlands sauce as we like. -A new weapon category, lasers and a new element, ice replacing slag. -A rather nice story located between Borderlands first of the name and Borderlands 2. We learn about Jack's past and the reason for his viceral hatred against bandits and ark hunters. The negative points: -The interface, the presentation, the graphics, even some legendary weapons of the previous games are THE SAME as in Borderlands 2. I find it a shame that a game released 2 years later is also predecessor. new content .. that's why this game reminds me of a huge DLC. -Many legendary weapons can only be obtained with the Crusher, a recycling-type crafting system that is easy to use but quite random. Okay, we'll have to farm the same mob 60 times more to get the long-awaited weapon, but ... at least this practice was making us hype. Moreover, few bosses or mobs that loot the legendary are farmable. Pity. -The difficulty as mentioned above can be an advantage for some but also a disadvantage for others. Dying 17 times against the same monster is quite frustrating indeed. It's up to you. -Few categories of monsters. The fauna of Elpis is much less impressive than that of Pandora. -A short lifespan. Indeed, the game is not very long and can be finished in 2 days by ordinary players. -Bugs in textures, enemies that cross the ground etc but nothing too serious seriously affecting the gameplay. I must have forgotten some details. In conclusion I will simply say that this game is good without being incredible. However, I would have liked to see more innovations from the developers in 2 years. Cartoon-style graphics still have their charm. PC level, Borderlands The Pre Sequel is a little bigger than Borderlands 2 without requiring a monstrous configuration. Finally I advise you to wait for the sales to buy it. Yes it's a good game BUT in my opinion it's not really worth the price. All of this is obviously my opinion and it was very hard to remain as neutral as possible as I love the universe of Borderlands. See you soon in game ... or for the release of Borderlands 3! * hype over 9000 * ",True,False
"""You're fighting a war that no one else is paying attention to."" // Reviewer played the game for over 70% of the main story at the time of Story ___________________________. For this part of the story takes place in Sanf. Francisco It will continue the story through the protagonist named Marcus. Holloway Young Hacker, owned by 'Retro' of the Deadsec Group, with the plan to overthrow Blume, a large American electronic media company. Carrying out the story in this sector reduces the serious tension from the original episode and adds humor and hilarity. The must-see in this installment is the main character. In addition to Marcus, there is also a group of his friends who have memorable personalities and make the game much more engaging with this group. If asked if the story in this sector is good or not, for us we must say no, but it is addictive due to the humor and the narrative within the game that makes the player enjoy it. And an additional mission that has bite in the social era that is so close to us that we can make small lollipops But the disadvantage we see right now is the main villain of the game that we feel a bit lacking in charm, in that his appearance is largely unrecognizable from the times he played in Gameplay ___________________________ game. The gameplay in this sector is considered to be well made and developed from the early part. With a variety of gameplay opportunities that allow you to play by utilizing the newly added system or using drones to reach the destination. Our favorite spot is the branding system that allows us to shoot various sights in San Francisco, which will increase the XP or the number of followers and unlock new selfies. Used as something that makes the game quite enjoyable. And the game in some places, both in the story and looking for items to unlock skills, there is a little Puzzle to connect the pipe for us to do, but it is worth it sometimes. It is a bit annoying with the location and the physics of the car that hit a little, crash or crank, and Graphic ___________________________ As always we would say that reviews of graphics in But as you can see right now, the images in that game are well made.

"At one time, the second part came to me strongly. What was required of the developers? Take the idea of the previous game, put events from hot Arizona in dank Colorado and add an interesting story. It would seem that what could have gone wrong. However, it went ... Improved in the game, except perhaps the graphics, and these changes still need to look, but the music. In terms of music, there are no complaints at all - the final country-style songs, praising our exploits or unknown death, went especially well. Everything else - the gameplay, the plot and its presentation ... quiet horror: - The armor and the amount of life in the game are just numbers, and absolutely meaningless. A melee fighter with a wild number of hit points and in the best armor for 80 hit points in almost every battle is taken out with one shot. And not from a sniper rifle, no! An ordinary gun or even a pistol. And vice versa - a sniffed opponent with an armor level of 12 units can be picked out with the whole composition a couple of moves, using pistols, shotguns, katanas and the like. Pomegranates of all varieties are even less useful. - Lack of ammunition and medicines. Where is it all? At a high difficulty level, I ran out of ammo exactly once for a sniper rifle in the prologue. After getting to the first store, the stock was replenished and there were no more problems. And with first aid kits of all formats it would be possible to lay out the huge word ""ENOUGH"" - Talking Heads on the entire map of Colorado. Why the hell did the developers add them to the game? No, well, let's say the idea is good, even in the first two Fallouts it was similar. But since during the development process it turned out that you are not exporting - maybe it was worth getting rid of this idea altogether? Why is the interlocutor's head shown only at the first meeting, and then we communicate as with the rest of the servants? Why, out of three children of the Patriarch, only two have speaking heads? Was the younger one not so important to the plot? - Companions that must be taken from the NPC for the full roster. Why the hell were they added? Senseless, they entered the conversation five times, and all the time they were dissatisfied with something. Some quest, moreover, is registered only for one ... - The plot is just something. Predictable as a forester's boots. No unexpected turns for you ... but what, and ""expected"" turns, too. Straight as a sleeper. Three endings that affect only achievement, but a couple of lines in a country song. I do not understand how it was possible to spoil a good start ... ",False,False

"Mordhau, A game of extreme aggravation and torment. When it comes to sword play games there is nothing better than this game especially in the medieval genre, wonderful customization and creativity, beautiful graphics, and awesome sound design. But it's player base and mechanics can get a bit heavy, players come and go with their toxicity but when it's there, man is it there. Followed by it's very heavy control scheme taking about half your keyboard and very awkward timing of swings and opponent reading, this game is the king of hard to learn, AND hard to master all at once. Vets coming from chivalry make this game a big up hill battle to climb when it comes to catching up, so do not expect this game to be a pick up and play kind of game, time and time again you will have your ass handed to on a silver platter until you get some form of understanding on how to defend yourself, but it's up to you when you learn it, sadly in this game you can't have everything taught to you in one night, you have to learn by playing countless of hours just to get somewhat efficient at dueling, and never mind fighting crowds of people. The learning curve is so deep you are gonna be scratching your head on what you did wrong half the time because it is not completely obvious of your mistakes, you are just gonna have to guess until you find the right one, which can take a day, or a year. Every attack is pretty much bindable but you may not have enough fingers or mental capacity to do all 6 directional swings and stabs, so I recommend using the 240 feature to do the swap work but it can be a bit unreliable at times, which is why I suggest using the 3rd person view for more spatial awareness as the swings depend on mouse movement which can make you disoriented in 1st person. The hitbox is super accurate and I mean crazy accurate, so it does not take much to miss an attack. (ping can play apart tho) All an all the game is very fun and a nice pass time, but the very hard mechanics and experienced players may ruin the enjoyment of the climb making you want to quit early, But unless you enjoy a challenge and want to over come this mountain go ahead and give it a shot. 7/10 and maybe even an 8 if the parry system was not so annoying and counted for everything on survival, I miss games using block as a form a defense and not just a stupid parry system, I can't stand games that do that. But if you are more of a casual gamer then I suggest you stay away from this and go buy something more chill, because there is nothing sweatier than Mordhau. ",False,False

I'm aloud to post a review, its my right. At the pace these devs are at right now, and with the small team they have; I don't expect much for maybe another year. Also if this was only for the backers, how did it get out to the public, it's their own fault and they have nobody but themselves to blame. It's going to be a long road for this game and maybe possibly in the future the game will change my perspective on how I feel about the game. Hopefully they can possibly expand their team to get things going quicker and more efficiently. They have a lot of publicity and potential, but need to kick themselves into gear. Best of luck Devs..

"Forget about everything that Uncle Sam taught you in the last part, almost all of these chips were cut out of the game. There is no more noise level here, run behind your opponents - no one will hear. There is no adequate stealth in the shade, there are only 2 levels: dark and light. In the dark you cannot be seen, but in the light the opponents suspect something. BUT, this does not work in the headquarters, they see you in the dark and sometimes through the walls, they hear you even when you sneak. By the way, the doors in the headquarters do not close by themselves, unlike other missions, and therefore opponents pay attention to this. The facial expressions of the enemies deserve mention, although the faces are realistic, but when they talk, they move as if they are dolls and control their mouth with a hand. There are so many bugs here that I spent almost half of my playing time on them. Do you want to complete the game without killing? Prepare for the bodies that you hide to disappear on their own and die. Constant crashes when loading the game from the menu and launching missions. You try to load the game via the ""Continue"" button - the game crashes. You try to load the game through the save list - the game crashes and removes the save that you tried to load from the list. It would seem that if you try, then the game can be played in 2-3 passes, bypassing these hellish downloads. But that was not the case, the game crashes with any wrong movement. Some crashes are tied to specific actions, and some are random. It will be lucky if the game just closes, and does not freeze and will not give an opportunity to shut it down forcibly, in such situations you have to shaman. Unfortunately, I found out too late that the game has 2 versions from different studios, one is good, and the second went to us. The PS2 version has all those features that for some reason didn't get here, plus a normal plot without holes. In both versions, the essence of the plot is the same, but in the version for PS2 we are shown more details and served it normally, and not as it is done here. If you don't want to spoil your impression and waste your nerves on this careless stuff, then it's better to watch or read the walkthrough of the PlayStation 2 version. ",False,False

" You slip into the role of a young warrior who sets out with friends to get three powerful, magical stones to stop an evil necromancer who wants to subjugate the world. So it is a typical fantasy setting, which is not wrong at first. Unfortunately, the story is told in an incredibly boring way. The cutscenes are much more about presenting the new units or having inconsequential conversations than about driving the plot forward. The characters remain extremely superficial and interchangeable, the same applies to the villain.  As the title suggests, it is a tower defense game. This offers 25 missions in which you have to defend up to 5 lines. However, there is no final backup, such as in or, which both work similarly. This means that if even one opponent gets through, it's game over. To prevent this, over 20 units, consisting of the troops that can be placed and their improvements, are available. On the other hand, there are roughly the same number of opponents, although most of them also have an improved version so that you can roughly halve the number of really different figures on both sides. In addition to an attack value and the cost, each unit also has life points, because your units can be destroyed by the enemies. This makes blockers more important. However, you cannot take all units and improvements with you, but only a limited selection. To do this, it is important to see what the enemy is letting go of you before the start of the fight and to adapt your own troops to it. To get units on the field at all, you first have to get money. For this you have to place treasure chests. These give you gold at regular intervals. You generate resources over time, but far too little to defend yourself effectively. If things go bad, you can use magic to help your troops. These 3 spells are automatically received during the campaign. You can only finish the game in the missions. This means you always have to do the cutscene before the mission if you want to finish. Since these are sometimes very long and above all cannot be skipped, this is very annoying. In addition, the game was smeared twice, in both cases when the last opponent had given up the spoon, so I had to fight the whole fight again, oh yes and of course the cutscene had to go through again. The boss appears as if he was in the second row, but in fact he is in the third. As a result, I strengthened all the units in row 2 and then wondered why they weren't attacking the boss, thanks for that ... The ice mages briefly stun enemies so that they neither move nor attack. However, if they release themselves from this rigidity, they glide through barrels or other blocking units when they stand in front of them. There are no other game modes besides the campaign, not even minigames, which makes the game extremely short.  The game tries to have realistic graphics, at least in terms of the environment and the opponent's design. The group of heroes, as well as their own units, are kept in one look. This seems a bit strange, but you get used to it. What you get less used to are the animations of the characters in the cutscenes, which are played in a boring loop. There are a few exceptions in which the figures really do come into action, but these sequences can be counted on one hand.  The setting is quite ok. There are different titles that adapt to the scenes in the cutscenes and in the battles there is mostly pleasant background music. However, the characters are not set to music, so you have to rely on the subtitles. Unfortunately, this always runs at the same speed, which means that short texts can be read several times, while you can skim a long time.  Honestly? So much mediocrity and a lot of crap for an impressive 15 ? Oh and that with a playing time of less than 4 hours? No thanks! The game was made available to the GGC for review purposes. ",False,False

"I really love the last numbered parts of Far Cry: these are bright and funny shooters in a live sandbox, where some kind of game is constantly going on. Ubisoft, apparently, decided that it turns out too well and it is necessary to pour in the ointment. As a result, New Dawn happened - not a game, but a real conceptual obscenity. In principle, the gameplay has two main drawbacks, but they go hand in hand: the need to grind resources for pumping weapons, combined with a small amount of content. The world map was reduced by half compared to Far Cry 5, without significantly changing the density of events. The developers tried to compensate for this with the ability to reset the progress of capturing outposts and a new expedition mode. These very expeditions are relatively small maps with different entry and exit points, where you need to steal a package with resources from enemies, and then hold out for a couple of minutes under fire until evacuation. It doesn't sound so bad, but there are only three such sorties in the game. So get ready to clean up the same maps and outposts at once to grind resources. What will happen to a player who doesn't want to farm gasoline and hardware to create a third level Kalash? Well, most likely it will suck even on ordinary forest moose or wolverines, not to mention bulletproof elite soldiers. If you don't want to please every second NPC, then the publisher has prudently introduced the possibility of buying currency to pump everything in the game. Every resource, skill point, weapon ... in total! You can pay on the go for the coolest fluff in the game and bend over. Think about it: Ubisoft is building a single player pay-to-play game around character progression and pumping it up with micropayments like a mobile jerk. Natural Pay to Win. In my opinion, this is almost the worst that the modern premium gaming industry is capable of. Speaking as devil's advocate, I want to note that the progression in New Dawn is more or less smooth and tries not to force events once again. However, this does not protect the player from the unfortunate moments of the third Witcher's level, when the developers put some high-level beast almost at the beginning of the game, which interferes with closing the point of interest on the map. The character reaches its maximum development in ten hours, which is even fast by modern standards, but, as mentioned earlier, get ready to farm resources by mastering the same content. I am doubly offended for the spoiled gaming experience, because behind the creepy monetization and stupid progression lies that very funny Far Cry with an interesting sandbox. Towards the end of the game, New Dawn generally introduces superpowers for the main character, such as invisibility or double jump. Jumping enemies on the heads with a flamethrower is pretty cool, I want to note, especially when your character is wearing knightly armor. It turns out such an amusing adaptation of the post-nuclear crusades. If you want to take a chance and play New Dawn for the sake of other means of expression, then it's better not to bother with the plot. It is functional enough, but not annoying, and beautiful videos are, in principle, interesting to follow. I would say that the story and presentation are at the level of Far Cry 5. What really worked out was the picture and the music. The soundtrack is very pleasant, and you can admire the local views. In the photo mode, I generally settled for a couple of hours. Nevertheless, behind a beautiful game in a blooming post-apocalypse, there is an evil simulator of Stockholm syndrome and psychological pressure on the player. Now imagine in the future games from Ubisoft, flavored with the same bastard monetization system, but with a price tag of 80 euros. The beauty! ",False,False
"This game can't be that bad, by God ... These are the points why I do not recommend this game - This game is full of bugs to no more power. When it comes to jumping or moving, the character gets bogged down or just doesn't respond. - Simple scenarios, they seem like scenarios created by paint, they are boring. - Game Too Short. The developers did not even bother to put more than 12 levels, as they are going to sell a game if it only brings 12 levels, it shows that they only created this game just to create it and generate profits. How can you believe that in less than 30 minutes I finished the game without any complications. In summary, I do not recommend this game at all, it only serves to have it as an ornament in the library and more nothing, because it is useless to play.

"A small visual novel (about an hour of reading) with elements of a ""quest"", which tells about a group of friends who decided to spend a weekend in a remote hotel in the middle of nature and faced terrible ""accidents"". The story is structured in such a way that the reader is given the opportunity to learn the plot from any of the company and make the story ""unique"" for everyone. There is no point in dividing the game into endings. they either repeat themselves, or only the character changes, the situation itself and the ending remain the same. To be specific, let's move on to the opinion. Sick fantasy of the developer. I think this phrase alone could describe the whole meaning of the novel, but you can't just take and call someone unreasonably, so let's find out in more detail. The plot is based on the narration of the same story from different angles with changes that depend on the player. This was supposed to become the main feature of the novel, but it became the main flaw - many actions and dialogues, regardless of the character chosen, were repeated, almost everyone thought, did and said the same thing, and where the player wanted and could change the course of events, they prohibited it to do and give only empty dialogue. In cases where there are still changes, the story begins to leave the main narrative and by his action, the player changed not only the reality of the controlled character, but also the reality of another who did not contact him and in fact, regardless of the chosen character, must lead yourself the same in the same situation. Yes, I understand that it sounds confusing, so I'll put it simply - the narration from the faces of different characters is done as crookedly as possible. As for the meaning of the story, its simply unbearable to read. Characters behave either inadequately (for the sake of a variety of gameplay for different heroes), or as banal and primitive as possible: ""Hey-s-s, what can you do in such a wilderness? Overpower the girls, he-s-s."" This is the whole plot: 50% nonsense and 50% erotic. Moreover, the further the story goes, the more delirium and eroticism becomes. Some heroes simply die, and at the end of the game, the survivors meet with ""Death"", who thanks for the help and apologizes for killing the friends of the survivors, justifying it by saying that he can do nothing but kill. But, then ""Death"" recalls that the second half of the plot is lust and offers the surviving heroes a three, two or lesbian sex, depending on who survived. Do you think I'm kidding? No, everything is so, you can evaluate this p *** t yourself, if you do not feel sorry for your psyche. And of course, how can a story be without fateful choices on which the course of the story depends. And of course they are in this novel. However, the most important of them remained in the erotic scenes cut from the game, which can be returned by installing the desired patch. After all, it is so important during a sex scene to make a choice where to ""finish"": on the chest, on the stomach or on ""* isu"". And this is not even ""ridiculous"", this is a real citation of the elections. Yes, I understand that, ironically, I am writing this review on April 1 (I will publish the second on purpose), but it was far from funny to me, but very krinzhovo. And to a great, but expected regret, the krinzh was not only in the plot, but also in technical details. Let's move on to them. Visually, for a free novel, things don't look so bad. Aside from the gnarled characters and the wry-eyed erotica, the backgrounds and a few CG artwork were decently drawn. The game even has primitive eye animations and a few background moments such as rain. And if you don't look at the picture (or have a vision of -4), then you might think that everything is fine. Music and soundtrack, these are good old compositions from the free music library. What do you want? Author's sound? In a free novel of this quality? By the way, the music was chosen badly, it does not hold either the atmosphere or the quality. But on the other hand, you can name a whole bunch of details: 1) never obtrusive advertising of the developer's website in the main menu (I understand that everyone wants to eat and be popular, but this is already some kind of impudence), 2) not translated main menu (if available official Russian language), 3) a bunch of untranslated phrases in the plot of the novel, 4) a jamb with names (Alice is sometimes listed as ""Liza"", and Pasha as ""Paul"") 5) spelling errors in the text, 6) braking when clicking on objects , 7) puzzles on the level ""move the puzzle pieces to get the correct picture"" and that's it. I think many, and without summing up, realized that this game, although it is free (strange, I would also sell it for money), but at its core, it is the schizophrenia of a developer suffering from anxiety about ""pussies and boobs"". There is simply no value in terms of plot or technical aspects. You can read this only as an introduction to the inner world of a sick person. In all other cases, I recommend that you refrain from reading this and leave an appropriate, negative assessment. ",False,False

If this is an example of a very positive game, Pillars of Eternity 1 and 2 must be a masterpiece. It's obvious that most of the positive reviews are from Larian fanboys and not fans of Baldur's Gate games. If you watch a youtube video critiquing this game, you'll see massive dislikes from the same people. I gave this game a chance even though I did not like how Larian just ignored all the fans of the first two Baldur's Gate games and how this game mechanics are just copied and pasted from the Divinity games.  For those people who say that the turn-based combat and the game as a whole resembles DnD tabletop more than the first Baldur's Gate games, you're right but this is a pc game series that came out two decades ago. Baldur's Gate 3 should be more similar to the first two Baldur's Gate games as this is an established series at this point.  Aside from the repetitive complaints from Baldur's Gate fans like myself, I still won't recommend this game just yet because the number of bugs in a single 3-4 hour session will make you want to kill yourself. There are textures that never load, crashes, black screens which forces you to restart the game, etc. The story itself is alright so far but nothing spectacular. I find myself going through the motions to get to the end rather than wanting to know more about this world. If this was a game by Ubisoft, Electronic Arts, or Blizzard, people would be all over this game trashing this game to hell, but since it's made by Larian, fanboys give all kinds of excuses and defend this game from anyone and everyone, especially Baldur's Gate fans.

You can get used to it, but it plays strangely. The main disadvantages include the unfinished nature of the game, it was clearly abandoned along the way, all these experience points, money, the number of mercenaries were screwed up, but they did not decide what to do about it. Enemies here are hopelessly stupid, they can stand for several moves while we kill them or run up to our group at close range. Well, if they hit us, we run to the side and, wiping the sweat from our forehead, we are treated, such an animation here, it's funny (no). The plot is linear, we play first for DEA, then for a drug addict, the differences are minimal. Cards are also not pampered with variety and instantly become boring. In both companies, there are 9 main story missions, in order to proceed to their implementation, you need to complete 4 side missions. In general, everything is as always, the game is based on the movie = we blind on the knee fast, the main thing is the Name. p.s.

"In fact, I expected a lot more from Deadlight, even though there were a lot of negative reviews. But I should have listened to what people say ... in the end, I was not ready for a huge number of bugs and other jambs, which almost completely blocked many advantages, forcing me to rush from a ""negative"" assessment to a ""positive"" one and back. Okay, let's take a closer look at this highly controversial game. The first thing we will encounter is the plot and its presentation in the form of a stylishly drawn comic book, thanks to which everything that happens is perceived extremely positively, and it is at least interesting to follow this. The plot itself tells about the events in Seattle of the 1980s, where the zombie apocalypse took place. The main character, Randal Wayne, along with a group of other survivors, is trying to find his family, which he thinks has been taken to a safe area. Actually, this will be our main goal, towards which we will go during 3-4 hours of the game, which, unfortunately, is not enough, but more on that later. During these 3-4 hours, our eyes will be pleased with quite good graphics, which do not upset with detail, and the comic, almost noir style withstands, and our ears will delight with cool sound design and a good soundtrack, quietly sounding somewhere in the background, but making the atmosphere even more gloomy. A few words should also be said about the gameplay. Deadlight is an action platformer with puzzle elements in which you have to climb different ledges and stairs, sometimes interacting with elements of the environment, which, in fact, are the elements of the puzzle, and sometimes entering into combat clashes with walkers, from which you can come out the winner only if you competently spend the ammunition for the firearm and the stamina necessary for blows with a fire ax, otherwise you will simply be bitten. Some sections you will naturally have to run, because sometimes a crowd of zombies, a military helicopter, or a generally dilapidated building will simply start to collapse after you. But ... it is precisely in these areas that one of the main problems of the game lies. The biggest problem lies in the very areas where you need to run a lot. The bottom line is that most of these sections are built on the most wild timings, which, if you don't catch it with an accuracy of a millisecond, you're a dead body. For example, closer to the final in one of the buildings above us, the ceiling will begin to collapse, and you need to get to the exit as soon as possible. This moment pissed me off in the first place by the fact that there it is completely unclear at what moment you need to jump in order to get sufficient acceleration and not literally die of air. At first I thought that this was just some kind of bug that would not let me go further, but no, this is the most real awkwardness of the developers. Therefore, already in the third hour of the game, when I got tired of all these bugged segments of the levels, I began to ask myself the question ""well, will it all end soon?"" And surprisingly, it all ended really quickly, and so quickly that when I saw the final of the game, I simply could not understand what had happened, there was a natural mess in my head. And only later, when I put everything on the shelves, I realized that the plot here, in general, can only boast of an interesting presentation. If the timing was stretched for another two or three hours to reveal all the characters, their motivation, the plot would only benefit. But here's the bad luck: if the timing were stretched, then the perception of the gameplay would suffer from this, which by the end was already beginning to pall. Honestly, I do not want to give a negative assessment to Deadlight, but, in my opinion, it does not deserve a positive one either. The shortcomings listed above hit the general perception of the game very hard, which has almost everything you need to make you love it, but alas, it is equally happy and upsetting. Therefore, I can hardly recommend this game to buy, at least for the full price and if you are not ready to put up with the obvious problems of the game. ",False,False

"Sadly, this seems to be an attempt at a retro shooter made by people who watched gameplay videos of the classics, but didn't play them (or played them and somehow got the wrong idea?) The two main weapons I've used so far feel way too underpowered (shotgun has trouble dealing with Imps, for instance) and the enemies all look too similar. This is also an issue with the rest of the game's overall look as well, since it seems like they went with a Hell theme that's basically ""hey, Hell is red-ish"" Level design is also a snoozefest so far, while we are at it. The music is serviceable, and the voice actor is clearly doing his best, but I can't help but feel dumb when he proclaims his love for the Church of the Triple Barreled Shotgun, while at the same time never having enough ammo to fire it, and when he does, it's a water pistol. So far, the game is a complete disappointment, with the only thing I like being the movement speed. I hope it improves, but I'm not so sure about the chances of that happening. I think I'm either going to replay the original Doom, or maybe DUSK or Amid Evil, those two are genuine throwback shooters that don't just try to copy the visuals, but actually improve upon the gameplay of the classics.

The game engine looks like a rip off of some shooter game. and the hud was like a 10 year old program it. and finally they are releasing dlcs and the game is a Early Access game... for me it was a bad experience thats why im giving it a bad review. ,False,True
"Much like the FIFA series has spent a majority of the last decade focusing on their Ultimate Team pay to win mode, PES development has left everything else than the myClub mode a relatively barren wasteland. It's been years since the traditional manager career mode Master League has seen substantial changes, and playing against the PES AI is not enjoyable to begin with. Gone are the days when different opponents had fairly unique playstyles; nowadays the only noteworthy differentiation regarding the AI is how extremely they cheat on the higher difficulty levels, with your own players becoming sluggish lemmings with slower and delayed animations in the name of a ""challenge"". As the myClub mode is available for free a couple months after each PES launch in the form of  , there's no compelling reason to pay even more (considering how much real money a bunch of viable players will cost you) just to play it a bit earlier. In 2019 the only thing one missed out by playing the Lite version are some particularly overpowered pay to win players that were only available in the months before the F2P launch (and, technically, a hilarious manager with four strikers). As for the online gameplay, it's most enjoyable playing against a friend of similar skill level on the same continent, given both are happy to lose matches to the other. The other modes are plagued by cheaters, gruesome cross-continental input delay, and absurd scripting/momentum (as seen in FIFA titles) that become very frustrating for any matches you do take seriously. Unfortunately Konami disabled the progression features that are core to myClub for matches against opponents of your choice. I understand that boosting is a concern otherwise, but in a game where a lot of the community grind out thousands of simulated matches (COM v COM) to slowly gain ingame currency, it's a rather absurd argument. On the positive side, because the game has a tiny playerbase, during off-peak hours it's very easy to get matchmade against a friend in ranked mode using moderate team strength. Coincidentally the game is also a lot more fun if one avoids using the best players  with weaker teams there is a bigger variety of valid tactics and players. Using two, three or four star teams is where the game is the most fun. It's still completely pay to win, and that matches against friends as well as coop matches lack progression features really brings it down. ",False,False

Well, it's clear the case - this is the Abandoned Rabbit Usagi Drop. Only in a pure Russian way - with a bunch of vulgarity and swearing words. To ruin such a simple and already fired plot, one must have talent. The texts themselves are literally about five meters below the baseboard, at the level of high school fanfiction. Spelling errors are not present in every word (which is a pleasant surprise for a game from a Russian-speaking developer). But reading this anyway hurts. As befits bad fan fiction, the story is dragged on nowhere, the text is unnecessary water. With art, things are even worse. Background images are rendered photos.

"In short: there are still no other boxing games on the PC. If so, correct me in the comments. The functionality of the game is justified by the low price tag, and could be justified by early access, but the game is already in release, which inspires some concerns and does not give a positive assessment. Of the minuses, the following can be highlighted: - There is practically no character customization - There are no offline championships (neither with bots nor at all) or a career - There are no battle settings - neither the time of rounds nor their number nor the choice of the ring - To play online every time you enter the game you have to login to their multiplayer. Why not do it automatically. - All sorts of graphic flaws - the audience moves synchronously, the girl with the number of the round teleports, the presenter opens her mouth, but there is no voice. Does he identify himself as a fish ?? One could say that all the flaws can be corrected and a good game about pitch boxing can be made, but again - the game is not in Early Access and I do not see any announcements of any improvements.

"Etherlords II feels like a game lost in what it's predecessor could have been, and what it wants to be.  It strives to give the same sense of battle as the previous game: turn based card battles in the same vein as Magic the Gathering.  However, it has taken all jeopardy out of those battles.  Normally, for me this would not be a bad thing, and indeed it is helpful, in that the game is formated much more like and RPG, like a story.  So each battle gives much needed XP and strategy information for further battles, and if one tactic doesn't work, another might. This would all work wonderfully, but for the fact that the story you gain is so scant, and the game primarily turns into a map crawl where you guess and pick and choose at which creatures are the best to pick this time.  If the game made the battles interesting, it would be one thing, but as a person who finds chess ultimately dull, this game made me horribly bored.  Plus there was no risk; you could just ""try again"" at any battle, having lost nothing, so the game turns into an exercise not really in strategy per se, so much as a guessing and recording game for each of the story lines, where you figure out what is effective through tedious trial and error, then reenact it on any higher level monster of the same type with the same types of creatures. The lack of investment this wrought, for me made the story boring, the battles tedious and the tactics canned.  With the sound and the graphics obviously salvaged from it's predecessor, this is barely two steps up the ladder from the first game, which was in all honesty more difficult and with a higher risk, but also much too punishing.  This sequel makes the opposite mistake, where there are no stakes, no worry, and the only thing this serves to do is waste the player's time trying to determine the best way to play, or to engender cheating using anything from guides to actual codes in an attempt to grasp the story. I cannot in good faith recommend this game. ",False,False

All I can say about the game is that it makes a strange impression. The concept looks very attractive - using an example of a specific situation to show how difficult it is for people with social anxiety to interact with the outside world. But for this it is not enough just to present everything in the frame of obsessive thoughts. The events unfold too straightforwardly: you go to the kitchen, prepare food, fail, repeat again until you are lucky. It is impossible to feel sympathy for the main character, and there is no satisfaction from the successful completion of the mission either. The player remains an outside observer, not associating himself with the character and not getting any new experience at the exit. This is especially sad because a healthy person is likely to remain completely confused about why all this was at all.

"I feel awful writing a negative review about this game, but it's just overall an unpleasant experience. Controls are absolutely horrendous. Moving anywhere feels like iceskating on a bannana peel. With conventional controls, this could be recoverable, but the mouse steering makes it a real struggled to aim anywhere at all. Partially due to the controls, I ended up with pretty severe motion sickness from this. The jittering combined with poor controls, and the overall nature of the game's style makes it unpleasant. I don't normally get motion sick, but this was definitely an horrendous experience. There's not too much else to say about the game. The soundtrack is pretty nice if you're into the genre, and the vaporwave aesthetics can be pleasant in places. The world design is a redeeming feature, and the level is fun to explore. It's unique, but also repetitive at the same time. It's difficult to properly enjoy the world with the bad controls though. There isn't much of a story to the game from what I can tell.

If you are a BIG power of 400 cities and you have lots of small countries with 10 cities each, you will tell me it makes sense that the bots should: either carry a good diplomatic relationship against the big country, or create a BIG coalition for put down the threat? HEY NO he doesn't care! But the game has an aggression system! The more you attacked, the more dangerous you are ... except that the aggressiveness you lose it VERY quickly, so you can re attacked galore ... and the BOT even if you have destroyed 50% of the planet, if your aggressiveness is at 0, he doesn't give a damn about you .... The diplomatic scope is poorly explained, but still makes sense in this world. The citizen system is coherent. But we absolutely have to put back the family system, character management and ADD more BUILDING! Because the possibility of building 4 buildings with a limit of 1 building maximum .... well it's a bit boring to buy a game at 55 euro with as little possibility ... My rating: -> Army: 17 / 20 -> Diplomatic: 12/20 -> Politics: 2/20 (Y EN A PAS !!!) -> Personal management: 0/20 -> Revolt: 8/20 (revolts are more strong than the other nations, their armies do not take into account the strength ... suddenly they can recruit at INFINITE). -> Technological: 16/20 very good idea -> Economical: 16/20 lack of difficulty ",False,False

"A review of the previous part can be found here: Serious Sam HD: the Second Encounter cannot be called work on bugs, since almost nothing has been fixed. The gameplay is exactly the same game, with the same problems. Weapons still don't feel right. New instances of the weather do not. Several new types of enemies have appeared, but they use old patterns of movement and attacks, which devalues them. Lvl design is still primitive and boring. But there are at least a number of changes here: Large open spaces appeared. Despite the introduction of the sniper rifle into the game, this change was rather a negative game. From time to time there are situations when there are a lot of enemies, but they run to the player for a couple of minutes. In some places, elements of platforming were added. Location design is uneven. In the first half of the game, he looks (after Egypt) more recent, but in the second he becomes frankly weak. Rooms with changed rules have appeared (for example, rooms where the player staggers from side to side). They diversify the gameplay quite well, although not all are successful (hello, castle in the middle of an icy lake (goodbye, remnants of logic)). During the passage, the pace of the game is reset twice, by selecting the entire arsenal, and dropping opponents to the initial level. Why this was done is unclear, it really affects the dynamics. The technical performance is at the same level. As in the first part, it is worth playing only from strong bouts of nostalgia. Sam has nothing to offer a new player. ",False,False

"This is a failure. No, ""failure"" is not a word that can describe my feelings. It's just f * ck. The game was released 10 months after the release of the second part, and was planned as a DLC. As a result, it turned out to be a separate game, which took one half of the chips and threw it away, and simply screwed up the other. Okay, now I will try to clearly state my thoughts. Plot: Billy Lerk from the second part decided to find her teacher Daud (who does not know, this is the murderer of the empress from the first part) to atone for her guilt. After finding him, she gets the last and most important thing in her life - to kill the Alien. As you understand, without the first and second parts, you have nothing to do here. Characters: I won't be lying if I say that throughout the entire game I sympathized with one Alien, and made a choice at the end in his direction. How frightened should I help the assassins against whom I played the first part, and whom I despised in the second? The stranger helped me in the previous parts, was a companion of Corvo and Emily, sometimes even helped out, and now the game tells me: ""Dude, we know that this is a key character in the universe of these games, we know that you fell in love with him, and now go and kill him Why? Eeeem, well, oh-he caused a lot of troubles, here, there he made a cult around him, yes. "" Okay, if the game tried to show the positive sides of these killers, but no, the game only shows those sides that, in theory, cannot evoke positive emotions. And then why shouldn't I give a fuck when the main characters have problems? And they mocked the Alien too. Someone whom I considered to be someone extraterrestrial, powerful, was made a rag, who is humiliated in front of essentially insignificance in comparison with him. An alien is a god, he knows the secrets of many generations and peoples. But now, a bunch of some wimps appeared who decided to kill him, and he just dripped. Either he will make a new hand, then he will give up the sword that can destroy him, then he will begin to justify himself in the most stupid way: ""Was all the sacrifices in vain?"" For revealing characters 0/10. Graphics: The same graphics as in the second part, perhaps the textures were corrected in some places. You will not see anything new in terms of the grafon here. Setting: The same islands, only now we are running along some monotonous streets, in some places we have been in the second part, but you no longer get such emotions. In Dishonored 2, I wanted to climb every corner, every lane, look into every apartment, because somewhere I could get lost, somewhere to communicate with the same Aliens, and now all this is gone. Although, this topic is already for the next point. Chips: This is my favorite part. Developed all so well that I don't even know where to start. Okay, the first is the rejection of runes and altars. I don't know if you can imagine Dishonored without these things, personally I don't. For the sake of which I climbed every house in the second part, they just took it and threw it away. For that we were given a couple of abilities from the very beginning of the game and forced to look for some fucking amulets, which I personally neglected in Dishonored 2. This only aggravated my opinion about the already poor * game. Well, the last nail in the coffin of Dishonored: Death Of The Outsider was the rejection of the chaos system. Well, it's just f * ck. You can come to any location, collect all the bots in one room, sentence each guard to quartering, quietly dump from there and everyone will absolutely * oops. The game only motivates you to move on to the next fucking locations, to fucking degenerate bots with Down syndrome, which at a high level of difficulty will shoot at the wall if they notice you. And at the end of the game, the heroine can easily change her mind about the main ""antagonist"" of this game. How many pompous phrases were said to the Alien, how many times Billy and Dowd called him ""black-eyed bastard"", and in the end she is easily ready to take his side, with the words ""he became a deity not of his own free will, he is good"" and you know what Dowd will call him ""poor"" in all seriousness. When I heard this I was just in a * yea, from the fact that the whole game to only heard about how good it would be to dunk the Alien. I don't know what kind of hard drugs the writers were on when they wrote this ... You know, this idea could have spawned a good spin-off with new interesting characters, after a couple of decades, when the Alien could really become a really negative hero, arrange complete fucking on the Island Empire, when a gang of Protestants appears, etc. Even now I may not have come up with the most original idea, but it would still be better than what came out. This is the only game I've played with a constant feeling of ""come on, come on, come on, end already"", and this is one of my favorite series of games in general. But this game has better reviews on Steam than Dishonored 2, although half of Dishonored DOTO's chips were slept from there. From now on, I will be more careful with the choice of games.

There is no balance, the survivors are ochidodrocheras. upd: 02/29/20: Complementing my negative review. I played enough in this game for 1k hours, it seems that something began to turn out in this game, but updates .... With each update, something better is added, and something worse. The developers make strong mana, but did not provide for discords, skype, parties, toxics, etc. Players begin to complain that it is impossible to play for mana, then the developers will fix the mana, cut the possibilities for the surv, but the party is not a hindrance. Survivors complain about strong, skillful mana, who played 1k hours for one mana and plays like a god. Developers rework mana by cutting down on his abilities. It happened with a nyursa (nurse). The strongest man in the game if you have arms from your shoulders. Haven't played dbd for about a year. I decided to download, see a bunch of updates for the year. I choose my favorite mana - ""nyursu"" and what I see. There is a limit on blinks, they are very short, long, and even limited with a rollback. At rank 20, against the same twenty with 20 hours and 1k mine did not make a single minus, at the same time, as a year ago, without perks and add-ons, against toxics with toolboxes and sawing hooks, I made minus 4. I played against famous streamers with 4k-8k hours and did minus 2-4 against the party. One of the updates, the developers killed this mana. Personally, I have a weak computer and the graph has become unrealistically soapy, that after 20 meters I don't see a fucking thing, if I see it like a person without glasses. The idea of the game is not bad, when the game came out it was great, but we developed and killed this game. Toxics appeared in the form of ochido, etc., their imitators appeared and began to terrorize the players, the developers had to make changes, but with each of their decisions, the game only got worse. There are many options to get rid of toxics, you just need to sit down and think, but the developers are not interested, it is much better to donate for bright, toxic clothes for toxicants. Initially, the game was about stealth, survival and hide and seek from a maniac. Now, it is who will play whom, either the survivor will troll mana, or the man will be trolled by the surva. No hide and seek, no stealth, no respect. The game has become poppy, don't buy and don't waste time. ",False,False

"Its pretty well known at this point that the hitboxes in this game (especially crash 1) are total garbage.  To name a few examples: Sliding off the edge of platforms you clearly landed on, getting hit by attacks when you are outside their visual range, and getting stuck between colliding hitboxes (this actually happened to me in Crash 1 on Heavy Machinery, I got damaged with a mask and the auto-jump that occurs when you get damaged trapped me indefinitely between two lava pipes) They can be frustrating enough just when playing through the story, but trying to go for relic runs is just brutal. And don't even get me started on whatever idiot decided it was a good idea to make NITRO BOXES RANDOMLY LEAP INTO THE FREAKING AIR! I just love doing a relic run making good time only for it to be completely ruined by nitro box rng (yes its completely random, I've checked) So IMO, save your money and just emulate the original games instead. The experience is not nearly as enjoyable as it should've been. Its like this: Would you rather drive and older and more reliable car, or a complete lemon with a pretty paint job? For me the former wins, and I'm sure that after playing the originals again most would feel the same. EDIT: After finally getting all achievements in this game I wanted to make it clear that I do enjoy this game, just not on the same level as the originals due to some questionable changes to game mechanics. Despite the hair loss some of these levels have cost me (Stormy Ascent and Future Tense, looking at you here) I am happy that this game exists if only to remind people that this great franchise exists.

"Although I really want to give this game a good review, obviously it still has problems.

The bosss high blood volume and brainless barrage attacks really make ordinary players a headache. The difficulty of the boss in the first level is comparable to Isaacs final boss, but the player can only use a small gun with a very low attack power to the boss. Tickling eventually died in the rain of bullets and bullets from the boss. At the same time, it was harder to get supplies in the game, and the items that were harder to get in the game did not play a practical role in the game. Its understandable that the current game is particularly well-received because the game does have some advantages: + lovely retro pixel style + brilliant and colorful graphics + distinctive animation features + some relatively novel designs, but I still think their colorful graphics are overwhelmed. If your mind is touched by the player, you will really enjoy it. However, this game is not very friendly to ordinary players and it will feel very monotonous after playing a few times. It is not recommended to buy it if it is tentacle. At least I am very disappointed with it. If the official has a big update or rectification of the game in the future, it may be worth a try. Finally, I hope the official will see: its a good game but its too hard for us not friendly! ! ! ! ! ",False,False

"I want to note one thing - I have nothing against anime. One thing is anime style, the other is, let's say ""content"" itself. Namely Dragonia- Shoot 'em up with RPG elements (yes, we cant do without it). We fly, kill hostile dragons, We are pumping, and at the end of each level there is a boss. But there is one BUT-playing is boring, not interesting, the gameplay itself is primitive. There are many hentai scenes, which is a minus for me personally. The plot is simple, and the translation is really fucking complete. Can I recommend this game? Definitely not. P.S. It's strange that Gabin missed the Steam game. ",False,False

"In this game you play a morally good person who falls into a web of evil plots. You got an assignment of a woman with a very visible face to protect a girl through the course of the game. Taking pity on this girl, because you understand her feelings you try to uncover the truth and try to stop the evil characters trying to capture her. The game features a deep story. Many morally bad actions by antagonists to portrait them as villains. The chance to cover behind almost all invironment. Sneaking like Deus Ex: Human Revolution where you have to try to hide out of the sight of everyone. The game is very contextual. The game is optimised for multiplayer, having leaderboards and challenges. And the levels consist mostly of going to point A to point B. And after saying all this I wonder in what way this game is linked to the Hitman-series... Hitman was one of my favorite series ever made. Every new title they made the game only better and better, untill they came to the beautiful point of Blood Money. Now they decided to make a story-driven game and take away all the things which made a hitman game a hitman game. I heard of the flaws of the game and didn't want to buy it (even though I loved every Hitman game before), but one day I could buy this game for 1 dollar on humble bundle, so I did. Hitman isn't a simpathetic man which is doing a job which (like Diana says in the game) ""used to have honor"". I'm strongly disappointed, but the thing is... I knew I would be. If you want a good sneaking game go play Hitman Blood Money or Thief gold or two... Oh and about the latter, square enix ruined that game too! ",False,False

"The game for the new film. A VR game from Sony for 4.99 with a new film license doesn't sound too bad after all. We start the game at the beginning we have a room with the known Jumanji board which we only have to touch with the hand. This is followed by a very small intro that is made up of characters from the film and the game. The impression is still GOOD. OK, we are in the game, a small world is displayed in the manner of a tapletop, we control a figure (The Rock) to the beginning, it just looks like you are playing with action dolls. The impression is still ok, it looks nice and it's a cool gameplay. First puzzles solved, move a few stones out of the way and put a tree with your hand over a ravine to free Jack BLack from his cage. You can move all physics objects which makes killing the enemy very easy because you steal barrels that explode to enemies and it Then you can not blow it up with your own hand with the game pieces. Ok 3 minutes later no new puzzle (just put trees over ravines) all figures freed all opponents killed, m ok shout the stone in the eye JUMMMAJJJIII and yes ne now the game is finished. So in summary 5 min game fun, very little content for the money as a free advertising game, it would be great so it's really not enough game for the money.

"As a CS fan (playing ever since 1.5) I cannot help but compare this to older counter strike games in the series.This is a long list, but it will help you out if you are stuck between buying this game or to save up for another. Imo it's nothing more than a knockoff of Counter-Strike:Source. Pros; 1_) Is a good game to gather friends around and have some fun time with Can't really find any other good changes in comparison to counter-strike source.It's got this hype about it only because it was well advertised and people get a hardon for weapon skins for whatever reason. Reasons why you should not buy this game: Cons; 1_) It's basically counter-strike:source with broken mechanics and cosmetics (You can customize CS:S for free anyway using mods) 2_) Hit detection is as bad as it gets.There are a ton of videos with a shot being a hit but it is not registered.    3_) 64 Tick rate in competitive servers.Really valve? It's COMPETITIVE.Even a regular dedicated server had 128 tick rate in CS:S - 1.6 and even still in CS:GO 4_) It's full of meme spamming squeeky kids thanks to it's similiar to TF2 item system. 5_) Has a smaller modding community.Counter strike 1.6 and CS:S had the largest modding community I've ever seen for a FPS game.This is because the game interface kinda forces you to queue up for regular/ranked games rather than browse community servers. People think they can prove their FPS skill by playing this game to get a higher rank.I think otherwise even though I'm one of those to carry the team, most of the time 1st on the scoreboard, I think ranking is about; 1_) Servers got 64 tick rate, anyone with medium-high ping are considered easy targets, since tick rate effects low ping people the least. 2_) Your rank is about how much you play it.You can just join ranked, get a good team and have them carry you to victory, then you'll get a better rank without effort ",False,False

"--- --- +Has fantastic potential with the home base and possible customization +Good graphics +Well polished considering how far into development it is --- --- +Super long queues with no bots to fill in so games generally have 2-4 players at a time +Paid game with in game purchases (cosmetic only) +Very limited current customization options --- --- RAMS is a Battle Royale game with a twist. You start with a fully fledged base of operations! With good graphics and RPG elements, RAMS has a TON of potential. --- --- : Pretty straight forward, it's hard to mess with an fps set up. Still, the hand to hand combat seems to be a bit funky with hits not landing when they should and some hits landing when they shouldn't. : The player starts the match on a train moving through the landscape where most battle royale's will have you in the air, giving you a more 3 dimensional approach to your original spawn, where the train is a 2 dimensional, leaving it easy for players to see when another player gets off the train and able to hunt them down quickly. Furthermore, you start matches with weapons, which, once again, wouldn't be a problem if the spawn system was a bit different. In it's current state, it's too easy to hop off the train right after someone else and gank other players making the already short games far shorter when there's only two people. : Pretty solid. After the match is done you get a good amount of money so you can buy more weapons and ammo.  I'm sure eventually customization options will allow you to buy cosmetics for your base. --- --- :  Good graphics. I haven't seen much of the environment because of previously mentioned spawn camping and games with only 2-4 players.  : Basic, however it seems that in the future there will be customization, but as of right now there's nothing special to note, good or bad. : Crouching is too fast and feels unnatural, when you jump your arms stretch straight in front of you, other than that everything seems a bit clunky but otherwise fine. : Straight forward, your general fps interface in matches but what I really like is how your home base acts as the main menu with a straight forward 'e' to activate and 'alt' to allow cursor to select menus. --- --- : The only bug I saw was while waiting in the lobby for a game random player models would kind of pop in on the spawn point. Nothing that breaks the game as far as I saw. : Solid performance, no lag on my end. However, without a full match of players to test the performance of the game you'll have to take this with a grain of salt. --- --- : Has potential in the future if the devs can attract a larger player base. : I would certainly not be happy paying 12$ for this. I frown upon non free to play games that have any sort of system where you can buy in game currency. On top of that, the game is currently unable to be completely experienced without the ability to play a full match.  The dev's should honestly think of making this a free to play title and have more in game items to purchase such as early development donation skins for weapons and players. --- --- There's a base of a game here, but no real gameplay in sight. No one is going to pay for this in it's current state if they see the reviews first. There's no one playing and if you get lucky enough to get into a match or two, it's only going to be against a couple players.  However, if the devs take my advice and make the game free to play with in game purchases, I feel that the player base would grow quickly and make the game a bit more worth playing.  Until then, I feel that this game is will not succeed on the current market, it simply doesn't have enough to offer that other, popular games already offer for free. In case the devs do take my advice and make this free to play, giving those that purchased it some sort of compensation, I'll keep this game on my radar and re-review it in the future.

"Full rant:  This is a placeholder recommendation for now, I will eventually post a more detailed and precise review about the game itself. Needed to make this placeholder review just to inform everyone not to buy this game until Bugbear cleans up their act. It's unfortunate that I have to do this, but I can't just sit here without exposing Bugbear for their shady practices that have been haunting the game's development. After many years, the game is still an unfinished mess, Digital Deluxe backers still don't have their perks and now... they made a new game and they are already developing consoles versions of Wreckfest without finishing the PC version first. It's clear that they are squeezing as much money as they can right now, so they blatantly screw their customers without giving a rat's butt about their reputation. The new game they made, is free for people who backed Wreckfest on their site. YET, people like me who bought the game on Steam for the same price, don't get the new game for free. There's no way, anyone in this planet can think this is fair. They don't care about their Steam customers, otherwise we would get the same perks. I've had enough with Bugbear and I certainly won't buy anything else from them unless they clean up their act. If you're reading this and you still don't own the game, wait until the moment they say the game is complete.

"Highly modular and customizable experience, similar in spirit to NWN, but the lack of regulation, or of a proper rating system results in a lot of confusion. The game is a blank slate where you have to use pre-built asset packages to create any entertainment yourself or most commonly, rely on the community to deliver entertainment for you. With Steam Workshop integration the community has created all kinds of different modules with custom assets and game modes. However, as a game that is kept alive by its community it also suffers because of it. Since there is no regulation, it's common to load up a module and have to sit through close to an hour of loading screens as the game is downloading not only the custom assets of the said module, but also the custom player models of those on the server. Most common of the said assets and custom player models may include Radical Islamic, Far-right, Racist, Pedophilic and Hentai themed content. ",False,False

"If I had to recommend this to someone curious about what PSO2 NA has to offer, I'd say nope. Straight up, the experience is a gambling addiction. I haven't played JP but I know the western release is a rushed downgrade of it, there's not really an endgame right now. PSO2 is an 8 year old game so many of the features will seem outdated. There are in game tutorials but they're vague, many will leave you wondering  . Some tutorials imply that a mechanic is useful and they won't elaborate on it at all so you can screw up your progression later.  * *I really can't say anything other than what everyone else will tell you. All you can do is search for online resources.  Anyways, I want to give you a scenario. Imagine trading being locked by a paywall. Yup, you connected all the dots. This is where I rant about  . There's a ton of customisation, items ect. It's more of a curse than a blessing, thanks to the classic 'we create a problem, you solve it with your money' business strategy. While it is optional to pay for the illusion of convenience, the tactics for luring people into handing over their wallet is akin to a mobile game. Regardless of you paying or not, you'll be screwed over by the damn fine print.  Extended storage? Subscription passes. Trading? Premium subscription or personal shop passes. Cosmetics? Usually bound to 1 character so you buy multiple passes of the same thing. Crafting? Oh yeah, you'll want a personal quarters pass for that. SG items? Can't be traded despite paying for it or taking the time to earn it. AC scratch is a gacha and percentages are a lie as long as you have RNG. As other people have said, this game is freemium and it should have been marketed as that instead of attempting to introduce new players to a disappointment. I've been enjoying playing the lackluster version of PSO2 and I have no clear reason for it other than somehow, finding it fun to play. Phashion is probably the only thing you'd care about long term.

"Anime fans eagerly awaited the release of this game, with the promise to see the faces of Ryuko and Satsuki again. As expected, the gameplay revolves around combat, with voiceovers and the original work. So far everything seems perfect, even for enthusiasts in the field of anime games, but you will see throughout this analysis that there are many more negatives than positives. Unfortunately I was warned not to give about the plot, but I can say that chapter 1 of the main saga follows as expected: Satsuki immediately enters combat, and she will be the protagonist throughout this main saga. There is a side story that will be another saga from, now with Ryuko's perspective. Both sagas, with 10 chapters each, should yield a total of. This was one of the factors that disappointed me the most, the main content is extremely short. Aside from the Ryuko campaign being the Satsuki campaign in terms of enemies and the like, the only notable difference are some scenarios. Before going through any of the stories, we will have to do the tutorial, and to be honest, it is quite complete. Of course, the role of every tutorial is to be complete and everything, however some still leave something to be desired. Here we will learn to use and explore all combat techniques. it has one of the biggest variations of combos I've seen in similar games, and of course that was quite satisfactory because the fights were not so monotonous. The mechanics themselves were also good even if they are already explored in other games, there are characters that need to attack from afar to take advantage of the opponent. Of course, for games like this, I recommend using console controls. In addition to the campaign we can take advantage of other game modes like versus, challenge, training and we can even re-play the tutorial. However there is a shortage of characters, which was to be expected by the number of protagonists of the anime itself, making us sick quickly whatever the game mode. In versus mode we can play both local and online, in casual or ranked battles. Honestly the online mode was a total bore, as it is very difficult to find other players available and able to look for a match. The most you could do is invite a friend to and play with him. Because of that, I couldn't even test it or test the connection of the matches. About the visual part, there is not much to comment on, they are traces of the anime so to speak, but I believe that they could have varied much more in the number of scenarios. In the midst of the fights you can see that the game was not well polished, even when running in the home of the opponents it seemed that the opponents were moving in a somewhat blocked way. To put it bluntly, the minimum requirements that ask for something of this size only show how developers didn't care about optimization, and it doesn't even come close to the issue of particle quantity and quality of effects. During the game I witnessed several, both in and in. A, from what I noticed, there are only two and they alternate between the and the fights. Arriving at, do not recommend. The game brings a certain emotion, but it is a very short and exciting experience, which lasts about four hours if only the campaign mode is played. The detail in all this is that they really did not go deep in the implementation, titles of this genre need content to survive and not become saturated. They do not need to have a high level of exploration and the like, something in the footprint would already be a good size. The price charged is, at the triple A level, of much lower quality. Wait for a promotion, in the range of R $ 39.99 I believe it is chewy, even for anime fans. : This review can be read on the website ",False,False

"Richard was a simple minded boy. As a kid, he liked to play video games, he liked that feeling of empowerment when he shot enemies left and right in the latest Call of Duty. He liked to have fun. Life was simple. Then Richard discovered achievements on Steam and his life took a turn for the worse. Now his games had this phallic bar below their titles, and as boys do he wanted it to be as long as possible. But it was often hard to get it fully erect, with no achievement left undone. All he wanted from video games was fun. Life was already challenging enough with a name like Richard after all. This changed some months ago though. Richard discovered that more and more cheap games appeared on Steam that featured a massive amount of achievements. And best of all, achievements you got for basically doing nothing at all! True, those games were not good or fun, but gaming had ceased to be about fun for Richard long ago. He wanted those numbers, he wanted them so badly. And now he could have them, more than he ever dreamed of, with little to no effort! In some of those games all he had to do was press a single key over and over again. Heck, not even press it manually, he just went out into his parents' garden and fetched a stone which he placed on the keyboard. At one time he even had a wet dream about that stone, after a fulfilling day of thousands of new achievements. Then Richard came across Drive-By Hero. More than 5000 achievements made him instantly buy it. And it was even a shooter! He used to like those. Of course the game was utter trash, cheap assets lazily cobbled together, the gun sounded like some stapler gone on a rampage, the gameplay was even worse than he expected. Three levels, one boss. The introductory message sounded like the dev had voice-recorded it himself with a cheap webcam. But he had stopped caring about things like that by now. He just wanted those achievements. So Richard played. His trusty stone wouldn't do for this though: every time he died, he had to press the mouse button to start firing again. He had already played for hours and still was only halfway through firing all those bullets. While he stared and mindlessly shot at the hordes of zombies approaching him, his mind entered a zen like dream state. He remembered those good shooters, the fun he had. After a while, with nothing else to do, he even began questioning the game's logic, how zombies running into his tank could cause him damage, or why he kept staring in the same direction although his tank made a turn. He moved the crosshairs up and tried firing at the full moon instead, to not have to look at the barren monochrome areas or the cheap zombies anymore, but the crosshairs stopped just a few pixels below the moon, unable to ever reach it, and he died too quickly that way as well. Richard fired away at those zombies for what was beginning to feel like an eternity. The image of the approaching hoardes of the undead dug deep into that simple brain of his. Once in a while, a tear would roll out of his unblinking eyes. Ever so slowly his mood would get worse and worse. What was he doing with his life? After a while the zombies and he became one in Richard's mind. Finally, his face expressionless, he stood up, grabbed that heavy, trusty stone and went into his parents' garden once more.

"There's too much positive reviews to not call it an organized campaign. The game has been made in Unity and I bet most of the models have been lifted from the unity asset store. Game can be completed in less than 15 minutes. It has enemies that are blind and won't hit you unless you choose to not kill them and just run past them. I was hit twice in my 2 minutes long pacifist sprint to the end boss. This game has only one level and it's extremely short, it has intersection of two streets in the middle of a city and a short, pointless train road that leads to the city from the house of a protagonist. There are no health pickups, no ammo pickups, no weapon pickups, you start the game with AK47 with 700 bullets and a rocket launcher with 100 rockets and it will suffice till the end. Main boss has a shotgun and he actually can aim, but you can easily outrun him or just jump on the building. Somewhere in the 2/3rd of his lifebar you'll race his friend (that will crash on the crossroads) and after that you'll fight him again. The End. The couple of screenshots in the game present all variety that can be seen in the game, so there's really nothing to see. One ladder that can be seen isn't functional, also most of the level geometry is simplified, meaning you won't be able to enter most building. Despite that you can still get out of bounds and run to the edge of the map, or bug the game out.  I am aware that this is a meme game but even meme games should have some content. Check VCB Why CIty for comparison, also made in unity by russian devs but with at least some content. This is just lousy. I'm pretty sure it's a student's project and the dev thought that a passing grade is just enough for commercial release. ",False,False
"This game has one big plus: the idea. The idea is really just great. We fly across the galaxy, looking for resources, managing the ship. What opportunities! You can create micromanagement of teamwork, conflicts between races, etc.; it is possible to create an in-game economy that will require the content of modules and people. And all this is surrounded by the fact that we are exploring the universe, finding other inhabitants of it, studying unique planets. But ... there is nothing in this game. The idea is cool. Everything else is missing. You just collect resources, use them to buy new modules. They only need electricity for their maintenance. People demand nothing but air. We collect resources, build new modules, collect more resources. All. There is simply no management on the ship. Can it be interesting to travel and explore the planets there? No. This is the main disappointment that awaits you in the game. All planets are a LITTLE piece of land in which vegetation and insects are randomly selected. When your boat lands on the planet, you simply collect resources that are scattered around the harvester. These are just stones that you need to go up to and hold down the button. Along the way, we fight off rare waves of local inhabitants. Sometimes so-called ""places"" will spawn there, where you can find artifacts. They are as dull as these ""planets"". Maybe the game challenges you? No. The gameplay is extremely dull and arcade, inadequately easy. AI is incredibly dumb. Enemies pose no threat to you at all. Beetles or humanoid creatures line up and stomp towards you. You can just shoot at one point and everything will work out. If you have experience in shooters, then the game will be incredibly easy for you. Imagine that you are playing CS: GO with bots on an easy difficulty level. As a result, from the description for the game it follows that you will try to start the genesis again and again, entering the game again and trying to succeed. In fact, I was able to launch genesis on the first try. What's the point in replaying this? ",False,False

"I didn't buy into the concept ... (DLC with season pass) -Story level (a little inconsistent): you play jack's brother who reappears 3 years after the start of the events of the main story and who finds Zoe her niece and tries to save her at all costs (right after the end of the not a hero DLC). The funniest thing is that this character lived as a hermit not very far from the Bakers ... Understanding with the DLC mini games challenges (off topic but funny) see additional story which is nice, here much less since it is supposed to close the incident. Same level of progress of the game: many inconsistencies with cutscenes to chain the levels where the main character loses track of a monster then finds it as if by magic in 10 cm of water then it disappears ""pouf"" or survives as per enchantment to a trap which should be fatal as in animated designs where the villain never observes the execution ... -Gameplay level: hmmmm NO, I did not know that faced with a biological weapon capable of destroying populations we can kill monsters (slime) with fist, see aligators .... Well here it looks like a horror game parody with superior craft than Mac Gyver -> a stick + bits of metal, or a chemical component = a bomb, a tractor (gnih?). We are starting to have ""mecha"" also with some weapons and to note some hitbox problems on enemies (normal with bare hands ....).

"EDIT 2 : After the Iceborne update, Performance issues are back. I re-edited my review. Seems that Capcom achieved to create a ""regressive Update"" (yeah it's a contradiction, right?). EDIT : After the last patch, seems there are no more connection issues. So I edited my review. Big fan of Monster Hunter series, i was waiting for this PC version for a long time. Now that I have it I can say that for the most part it lived up to my expectations, they added many features that I hoped for. - Good variety of monsters to hunt: old as much as new ones (some are a dissapointment but    hey, it's my opinion). - The maps are gorgeous, and dynamic : you can use the field to your advantage. - Since the Online mode works fine, plenty of hunters to play with.   Good feature : your lobby can support up to 16 players, helps alot if you have more than 3    friends (old games were limited to 4) playing with you. - Iceborne is a good expansion, lots of new monsters to hunt (plus those yet to come) - The maps are bigger wider - The new featured tool Clutch claw is a bit too much, though it adds some flashy moves. The game at it's core is good but UNFORTUNATELY, and I think all those months of delay was alot of wait for a mere port with big performance issues:    - Alt-Tab when the game runs in the Fullscreen mode causes a crash...    - The game is even more taxing on your system than it used to be (90-99% of CPU/GPU usage, and I tried many ""fixes"") I recommended the game since 11Nov 2018, but as it is now I DON'T RECOMMEND buying it!

"Artillerists is like a really bad, unbalanced version of the old boardgame Battleship, which has been re-created as a video game quite a few times and much better than this. This is a complete guessing game, at least to the extent that I have played it. You can earn money to spend in an upgrade shop (the Artillery, where you buy ""abilities""), but you have to grind out guessing games to earn the money.  Whereas this is obviously a Battleship style game (obvious even before you purchase the game), what you don't know ahead of time is how unbalanced it is. By the third mission of the main campaign, you have 2 mortars in a 6x6 grid. The mortars take up one block each, so you can only take 2 hits and then you lose. The AI has more than 6 blocks of units in a 6x6 grid, and the game gives you no idea how many the AI has at the beginning of each mission. I haven't made it past the third mission of the main campaign (as of this review) because this is just a pitiful waste of my time when I could be watching paint dry instead. The AI also has ""abilities"" to hit multiple blocks, whereas you are stuck with grinding to buy lesser abilities early in the game, and they are really expensive and underpowered, particularly when the AI has some  that can hit like 5 blocks at once as well as at least one airstrike (which hits 2 blocks) by this third mission.  You can use radar and airstrike abilities if you have purchased them at this point, but they are very expensive. When I say expensive I mean you will grind out clicking on grids trying to win missions in order to gain money. There are side-missions in which you can gain money, but the clicking and guessing is just horribly boring. In the game Battleship it's essentially the same, except you know what you're up against (the same units as you have, and there is a little more fun to the minimal planning and some strategy involved even though it amounts to guessing). This is just a poorly thought out game. Nobody likes an unbalanced guessing-game. There are people that pop up with irritating dialog as well, which just makes it even more annoying because that makes more clicks to grind out.  Count this as an extremely negative review. HUGE thumbs down! ",False,False
"TLDR: If you expect a Sanctum-styled game,look elsewhere. If you are looking for a fun defense shooter to play with friends, go ahead.  This game's art direction looks and feels amazing, but if you expect the game to require deep strategy in the tower builder phase, don't expect too much. I bought this game expecting something closer to Sanctum 2 which pushed both the tower defense and shooter parts further. This wasn't really it and was kinda disappointed but kept playing since it seemed like I had a misconcetion about the game's intents in mind. The game seem to mostly revolve around casual multiplayer game with friends, which isn't a bad thing in itself, and some good old run and gun with a few traps you can set around the map. Those traps are mostly to buy you time when you are looking elsewhere, there's no crazy combos you'd expect from a Tower Defense game. It feels much more like a pillow fort than anything else, really. If you want to play this game, the higher difficulties will require more team coordination than strategy, which can be annoying when playing solo. I didn't really find what I wanted in this game, but if you like playing any kind of player vs AI multiplayer shooter, this game is made for you. Edit: Rewrote the review as I didn't feel like it conveyed my feelings about the game the right way. This game's amazing even if isn't right up my alley. ",False,False

"The highlight of this game is undoubtedly the graphic, it is visually very beautiful, with incredible landscapes drawn by hand. Gameplay is quite different from current games. The game is in 2D, but you interact with the environment in the 3rd dimension that is made in layers for you to continue with the path, these layers most of the game are easy puzzles to set the path for you, but in some moments you will have to solve some a little more work, those of the sheep were the most annoying. But still, the game doesn't hold you very much in the plot or in the difficulty, there are about 15 chapters in which you can finish in 2 hours or less. The soundtrack is very weak, not very striking, it seems more like an ambient elevator sound that most of the time you don't even notice is there, changing very little rhythm during the episodes. And the story is quite clich ... basically telling it here would be a spoiler, since the game is very small and it is part of the narrative to find out why you are traveling. At no time are there dialogues or even texts to be read. And through moments of reflection, through memories, the player discovers what happened in the life of this man. Despite being a bit sad and portraying a novel, the plot itself was nothing appealing or exciting to me. I advise you to buy it only if you have it on sale, although it is not so expensive, it has short indie games that are much more worthwhile. There is no replay factor in gambling, as the story is very simple and easy to understand, there are no trophies or collectibles during the game. ",False,False

I will not be totally bad with the game having 50 hours on it I admit not having finished it, not that I do not want to but when a bug prevents you from progressing in the game what to do except wait for a patch to fix it? And I don't remember that I bought KCD in early access, I don't recommend this game because I just have the impression that it is not finished at all, imagine my frustration, it is as if we offer you a film and we tell you: ""well wait, there is something wrong with the film, we will have to wait.-Uh ok and the rest of the film, when do I have it? -Bah that I don't know until I have your money that you slammed for my film the rest is fine with me ... - ha ok ... (it was the story of Jean-Michel Pigeon) I also find that the game is not worthy games that are currently being released, this game would have been a marvel if it would have been released ten years ago but it's just no ... the physics is crappy, the fights are nice (defois) but it just becomes incomprehensible by moment, when your brave hero is seized with spasm and you don't understand what he intends to do with those sword blows and the movements of his attack are unclear it's just abhorrent, the game is technically for me to the ram enough .... The bugs are numerous between loads, which do not end, characters who speak to you during a scene and who the following sentence are silent or speak another language, the quests completely bugged, the game that crashes randomly, up to you and your luck especially if after an hour of play without saving you have a nice ""Kingdome come: deliverance to cease working"" ... For all these reasons I do not recommend this game. Mafia 3 had received a lot of low marks because of these bugs, I find it hard to understand why for KCD it is not, especially since the bugs in Mafia 3 were less punitive than those in KCD. Because here no automatic saving to be able to save it is necessary to drink an alcoholic drink (yes yes normally when we get drunk we tend to forget bah here it is the opposite loul) Buyable drink from some merchants, or it is enough simply to sleep in certain places (not all) so that your party is saved, or even launched a fairly important quest, but if you are in the middle of the road without your little apple vodka bah adios the save (especially if your game crashes before). If KCD did not have all these bugs I would recommend it without hesitation Because in itself the game has a very beautiful identity, here no dragon or magic a realistic knight game without elves or crazy people, the villages are super well organized (hello Plaza) each village has its own identity, we really have the impressions of traveling through different towns, the map is really cool, even if the hero is a bit naughty I think that gives his charm precisely. The game is also full of humor, some lines of dialogue my good laugh, the choices offered to us are appreciable, and the medieval spirit is very well transcribed with a very complete codex on this time for the most curious of 'between you. But frankly, other than that, I want to say that the game is good .... but really nothing more ... JUST GOOD. I have the impression (and be careful, it's not an insult!) To play a skyrim dlc a little bit (but then really a little bit) technically improved and which is in another era without magic nor dragon to which we have to add and remove some gameplay sequence ....

"Pros: + Good selection of rally cars, both classic and newer cars. Although I miss some classics such as the Lancia 037 and the Opel Manta 400. + Stages are interesting and challenging. Not as good as WRC 7 and Dirt Rally though, but it beats Dirt 4's autogenerated bland stages. + Physics in general are OK. The game is more sim than arcade, which is good. + Very good and varied career mode. + 'Loeb experience' mode is nice. + Cars have their official livery. You can also make your own if you want. + Interesting historical info about the cars. Cons: - Very weak sound. I think this is the worst thing about this game. - Graphics are bad. A game like Dirt 3 has actually better graphics and that game is 5 years older than this. - Can't clean the windshield, which gets annoying. I recommend the bonnet cam instead of cockpit because of this. - Cars flip too easily. Can be very annoying at times. - Inconsistent AI. Sometimes you can beat them by 20 seconds on the hardest difficulty. Next stage you might lose by 20 seconds. Although most Rally games seem to have this problem more or less. - MP is pretty much dead afaik. - No community events like Dirt Rally, Dirt 4 and Wrc 7 have. - Co-driver is sometimes way off. For example: when he says right 2, it can sometimes be a hairpin.  - Sometimes the co-driver calls come very late (even if you have it on the 'very early' setting). That's a problem in France when you're driving a fast car with weak brakes like the Lancia Delta S4 and there is no time to brake. I guess that's what the rewind future is for. :) I don't recommend paying full price for this (29.99) considering how many problems this game has. However, I bought the special edition for about 10 and I think it's a decent game for that price. This game is enjoyable from time to time when I get bored of other rally games such as Dirt Rally and WRC 7. In conclusion: Full price: not recommended. If you pick this up on a sale: recommended.

This is not a freemium game the soviets are just as good as other nations you  have to perchas ) i ended up buying the American expansion with $$$$$ it was that good of a game the US expansion online they start with a base but have expensive upgrades to unlock the tanks so its the same as soviets just different men fun but and worth it This game is definitely worth real $$$$  I would pay for the game I got for free in hind sight  its like red alert but not silly and the online play is the best  im an older Australian gamer and dont like playing online vs people (they drop me so fast)and ping makes them complain but this has no ping problems.

I'm not a particular fan or worshiper of ""find objects"" but I like to do one or two from time to time. it must be said that most of the time the stories are not terrible ... This is unfortunately the case in this one ... During a trip by Robinson boat and hit by a terrible storm and ran aground alone (with a dog and two cats ...) on an island.

And he does it alone and without tools!

It seems to me that the game dates from 2015 ... still has a positive point, which is the interaction with some elements of the scenery to find hidden objects. But this is the only one I found. In short, the game could have been nice ... but it is not ... It's a shame because I like this kind of theme: Robinson, Friday or the wild life, the treasure island etc ...

"Where to start with this game. There is so much wrong with it. From the developers to the foul community. Let me start with the community, because this is whom you're going to interact most with. It is filled with  ,   and others. I had the unfortunate experience of walking into a condo filled with watersports. The owner was a   who proceeded to inform me about how she sells marijuana in her own neighbourhood. She then told me that because she forgot to UV ray her product one time - she urinated on it instead and sold it to customers unknowingly, who reportedly liked that special produce batch. She then does this with her partner.  This isn't uncommon for this game. 99% of the houses will be littered with furry and water sports. This community is not safe. It is not functional. Most of the player base have something very much wrong with them - from being suicidal to just down right weird. The developers don't care about it either. I informed them about some condo that had hints of child porn in it. They chat banned me instead of looking into it. Way to silence whistle blowers. My friend also got channed banned but for entirely different circumstances. Another friend of mine doesn't play this game anymore because the community is so, so weird.  Moving on to the developers, ah the developers. Cut from the same cloth as the player base.  They don't know what they are doing with the game. It's poorly made and even though they have a road map, it makes it ten fold worse that they can't stick to it as an early access game. So, in conclusion. If you're a furry, or you are into animal watersports on humans and love to see child porn littered around condos - then this is the game for you. BTW, if you are wondering why I got this game? I purchased it for the golf mini game. I found out about the other stuff when I visited the public lobbies and condos. ",False,True

"Perhaps many will disagree with me now, but I want to write in detail why this game is in this response. I spent a lot of time on this shit, so objectively: Made by krivoruk, read the forums, read such reviews, and you will see that the shooting at CSGO is built randomly. More specifically, only two things depend on you - how quickly you aim and how you can control the recoil, that's all that depends on you. The rest is decided by the game, it itself decides whether the hit will be registered, this system is at the moment. Each of them had cases from the category: ""Well, I hit, I hit"", and so, you really could get, you just became this shitty system. If you want an example of normal shooting go to 1.6 Done absolutely stupid. Firstly, speed with different types of weapons, this is useful for dynamism, but if this is done correctly, there is no stability in the same garbage dump during shootouts, so PP and other less popular weapons become useless, Kalash and MKA are still imba ... About hitboxes: also full of feces, the game has huge problems with registering hits, you can see for yourself by running the display on the test card. Here everything became clear when the game went free-to-play. It is a pity for the cybersportsmen who have dedicated their lives playing in this trash heap. ",False,False

Then they show you on basic enemies ""when it glows you dodge then times slows"" this is the only like 2 sec you can use to even try to do combos, becouse in this game you need after every atack just hold this button to stay still and shot/do something else, when every enemy besides starting will just  you up then and without it you don't do any dmg. Then next enemies doesn't have ""glowing attacks"" and are even more obnoxiouse than camera becouse u have no way to tell what they are doing and you get kicked even without seeing this THEN even after you stunlock enemies and want to do something they starts to say NOPE and kick your ass for no reason, that's even worse than everything else. (One extra sin is that even if you dodge correctly most of the time you get sound for slow time, but it doesn't slow and it piss you off even more) You either plays street fighters and will get this combos or you don't and it's just impossible becouse u don't even have any place to train. And it doesn't help that ""style"" meter in this game is just bad for everyone start, you get panalized for everything, becouse if u get hit you have - points and this points doesn't even care if u spam same attack, it just get record of how many times you attacked. 2/10 this game is VERY BAD if you don't play teken/SF/etc and isn't a horny tenage boy that just wants to have camera shots on tits and ass and nearly naked main char.

After all, if you run out of oxygen, then you will not die, just nothing will change.) -Sounds: Monotonous hum of a helicopter.

How did she go through the greenlight at all? Yes, it is not worth a penny. In short, I do not recommend it. Oh yes, there are a lot of bugs and holes for textures.

"Pigmentum is a very basic reaction based game. To call it ""minimalist"", as the store description says, is both euphemistic as well as an overstatement. It's barebones: a block has to pass through blue, red and green bars while matching their colours and you can switch the colour of the block by clicking on the according buttons. And that's it. I'll give it that is is responsive, but the buttons are so widely apart that you have to both focus on the main screen as well as them. Simply allowing keyboard prompts would have improved this a lot. The game offers an optional retro filter, you can turn off the two different sound effects and set it to fullscreen. None of these options are saved, but you'll likely never touch the game a second time, since the gameplay doesn't offer much at all and the achievements can be completed within minutes. Even for a free mobile game this would be considered overly simple. Heck, even compared to the most basic of Atari 2600 games it's lacking. This is something people just learning how to code will be able to cobble together after their first few minutes to hours, not kidding. If it's part of a bundle, it's okay to kill a few minutes I'd say. Otherwise play just about any other game, don't spend money on this. ",False,False

"And now, 2 years after the release, I still decided to express my opinion about the folich. For a very long time I tried to write a review, but somehow there was no desire. In 15, I probably, like all fans of the folly, pre-ordered the game for 2k, in the hope of something unreal and interesting. I counted the minutes until the release and already imagined it as a waste for a month, as it was with the smoke. But, my interest and impressions lasted exactly 50 hours. After 50 hours, the game gave me one fucking disgust. Absolutely boring gameplay, the same random events, worthless plot, linearity. No interest in looting locations, but why? In safes, apart from money, silver, a little rare trash, patras and other shit, you cannot find. Where is the interest to find something unusual and secret? Everything is already given in random and quests in abundance. Hence the interest to travel the world disappears. Fractions? What's the point of them at all? Where the fuck is the ""Against All"" point of view? I dont even want to talk about the plot with the ""awesome twist, which I have never seen anywhere"". The only thing that really made me happy was the huge and beautiful city. All the pumping that they were so fucking proud of turned out to be an illusion of choice. In 60 hours it was possible to make a universal soldier. Yes, on the one hand it may seem that this is the right choice. Give the player the ability to change his original build to the build he wants now. But damn it, why was it impossible to reset skills or retrain some special characters for a lot of money? At E3, they shouted with foam on their lips that in Fall 4 there would be the most seamless world. As a result: 2 seamless locations and a bunch of locations that have no seams (i.e. just a place in the wasteland, like there is a house and you will see a location with a name) and they have one safe. Well, without a seam? Without. Brilliant? Brilliant. Even though I have almost 750 hours, of which 700 hours I entertained myself. This is the only game in my memory where I tried to force myself to play the game and somehow entertain and have fun. All the same, there was so much waiting for a new fall ... My whole game was waiting for mods. It's not a secret for anyone that the mods for games from befesda play an important role. So I played 4 from one travel mod to another. Complicating the game, adding some kind of plot modifications from people, in order to somehow entertain yourself. Added new loot to the leveled sheets in order to diversify the loot. Yes, even travel fashions went into the folly after almost a year. For even the moddoders were divided into 2 camps: some remained in the old games, the new ones switched to modification 4. And the second travel pieces 20 maximum IMHO. Separately, I would like to say about the DLS DLS workshops. After the release, I had only one question: FUCK? At that time, the mods for adding items for the construction site were just darkness. What's the point of DLS if there is much more and better content in the mods? And about the whining eblanov who say that the construction in the game is complete nonsense. How can you listen to these people if these same people 7 years ago addicted to fashion construction sites in Vegas? Nuka world? DLS on which I had pinned great hopes turned out to be the most boring runner in less interesting locations for an hour. Plot? He is not in the DLS. The only track dls turned out to be Far Harbor with survival mode. This is the only DLS that caused at least some positive emotions. I don't even want to comment on the DLS about the mechanist. The game turns into a monotonous shooting range after 40 hours. Shooting gallery with the same loot, with the same gunfights. There are very few interesting quests from the whole game. Roleplaying of characters is zero. Interesting partners? Yes, they are all monotonous with a full set of cliches: Here's a mercenary who went to kill to raise money for the treatment of his child. Here's a drug addict who wants to be cured of addiction ... And the only character that stands out in any way is the robot Curie. The quests of which it was really interesting to go through and implant her in a new body. Want to choose sides in an in-game war? Fuck you. Choose: 1. Homeless people in plain clothes who want to embody the spirit of old America (WHY THE FUCK?) 2. Homeless people in the basement who dream of rescuing transgender robots. 3. Homeless people in power armor who want to kill transgender robots and those who protect them. 4. The totalitarian elite, which has been hiding under the ground for centuries, which has unreal technologies, unlimited resources and which flies away from the sabotage of the homeless from the wasteland for two times. I dont want to talk about the poor hackneyed diaologists either, its a real drain. Even a mod that made a dialog box like Vegas doesn't help. Constantly ridiculous dialogues: - Will you help me? Kaef ... Of course, there are pluses in the game. An interesting, detailed world, an interesting character editor, a really high-quality jester component. The contrast is especially noticeable in comparison with Vegas. Interesting customization of weapons ... But what's the point when the disadvantages of the game are much more significant than the advantages? There was a huge potential in the game, which the befezda successfully pissed off. ",False,False

"I used to really like this game, I've logged hundreds of hours into the game. This new update ""Waking the Tiger"" has entirely ruined the game for me, the army managment system has become headache inducing, Field Marshalls are now just a hastle to use and the supposed AI fixed have made either your defence so utterly terrible that you just want to die or make the hostiles defence laughably disorganized making invasion with simple infantry entirely possible. The new stability and war support systems too have made the game just that much more of a hastle, sure they add some ""realism"" to the game by adding a political layer to it, but no one plays this game to appease the countries people and justify wars, no we play to kick some arse and dominate the planet (I.E Europe). Another great example of a botched mechanic would have to be the new mobilizing forces addition, which makes making an army take far longer than it needs to be, especially if you're attempting to create a massive defence force in preperation for a multiple front war.

"We wanted it like Mirror, but it turned out to be another Hentai. What can you say about the developers of this game? At least the fact that they don't want to invent anything of their own, but they want to make a conveyor of erotic games. Whether this is bad, yes, in principle, no, but the implementation of all this is extremely upsetting. I don't want to talk about all their games, so let's talk specifically about this game. I have already spoken about the carbon copy of Mirror: the splash screen, design, short story, main screen and erotic scenes - everything was stolen from that game. The only exception is the changed gameplay to advance through the story. If in Mirror it was a 3-in-a-row game and it was really interesting, then here there are broken levels and an extremely boring implementation with the connection of balls traveling at the speed of a turtle leaves much to be desired. Maybe an interesting story here? Alas and ah, there is no short story here, dull dialogues, boring plot, and, in principle, the developers have at least some flight of thought and desire to write something interesting. For example, in the mirror, each heroine had its own plot, there was no main character who, throughout the entire game, only thought about how to ""play pranks"", of course, I will not lie, not all the stories there are stunning, but at least they are different and there are many of them. Yes, and there are 2 endings, although you can only influence them in bed scenes, but still a good idea. I gradually wanted to play mirror because of the short stories and the game of 3 in a row. But I can't say badly about erotic scenes, they were made in my opinion even too much, right in the best hentai traditions. After 3 victories over the girl, the first heart is unlocked, at the first stage the girl will be half naked and you will be given 5 actions (I dont want to describe, but Ill say that this is a classic of any hentai online game on the Internet), then you will go to stage 2, the girl will accordingly become naked and you will already have 9 interactions, respectively, the number of items for ""playing"" with her will increase. After 4 victories, a short hentai will open, where you can use the arrows on the sides to change the stages of this process, if you think that they are very different, then you are mistaken. And big and fat And, no matter how well people say about erotic scenes, I want to draw attention to one important detail, namely the sound during these very scenes. I think no one will deny that the voice acting of the heroines not only kills the desire to enjoy the gameplay, but even, I would say, repulses. It seems that they recorded the sound in the closet, even in the children's cartoon Fairy Winx the moans of the heroines could arouse much more, insert them into this game. And what is the result? It depends on the person who needs it, I personally could not get hooked on the game, despite the large amount of erotic content, I wanted either a normal short story or interesting gameplay, and as a result, the developers, as for me, are just lazy to the ass and don't want to invent nothing of their own, because they have a wonderful designer who can sell any of their unfinished game due to the erotic component. Personally, I don't want to support developers who can't even copy. As for me, starting with the game ""Hentai girl division"", which is not very different from this one, they start to slip. P.S. You can say that this is a review of mirrora, the ascension of that game, over this dermisch - please, say, comments are always open, I just wanted to let people understand that for the same money there is much better, where every element of the game is well combined and does not turn into something from the category ""as soon as possible to pass it."" Again, the only plus of the game is the scenes, but after the mini-games and the plot, I somehow suddenly got sick of it. Briefly about what is on top Pros: 1) A large amount of erotic content (the game has not only interaction, but also just pretty good scenes, although these scenes differ only in the speed of copulation and f_ckin c_m). Cons: 1) Unfinished (in places broken) boring, monotonous gameplay, which the developers have in a hurry tried to somehow complicate and embellish, but it would be better not to rush. 2) An extremely boring and terribly banal novel, which tells the story of a guy who could (he was able to fuck all the girls on his way).

In all honesty this game has disappointed me. For me personally Saints Row is a game of over the top ridiculous nonsense (at least in recent additions to the series) and this game is just not there.

(Can't stand the devils daughter)  Lack of character from the main crew - you only see characters such as Pierce and Shaundi at the start and end)  All the side quests are annoying or boring - there wasn't a single one I liked  The wings are hard to control  The map is quite boring  THE VEHICLES - can't save any and they all look awful  No music - like cmon really?  The game is so short - like who is going to get the 40hours+ achievement when the campaign takes 8 hours to complete  I love the saints row series!

"The game has reached its cynite. This is mainly due to the fact that the developers set the wrong milestones. Instead of taking action against cheaters and fixing network problems, they patch in new skins. You are very often killed by bullets from opponents, although you have been under cover for 5 seconds. If you gamble against people with bad pings, you have to look it up yourself because the hit registration and the kills are calculated by the clients and not by the server as usual. Bullets are often simply swallowed by the netcode. You storm a house, shoot first and empty half the magazine and your opponent doesn't die, instead you are killed by him. If you then look at the Deathcam, you can see that you didn't shoot yourself ?! If you manage to get into the last ten at some point, there is a 90% chance that you will meet a cheater who will steal your victory. I'm talking about cheaters that obviously cheat, cheaters chasing the heads of opponents through walls with the target circle, cheaters shot through bushes and treetops although the view is obscured and cheaters who only play Uzi, and shoot people with continuous fire at 200 meters without that a bullet missed. It is not clear to me why such obvious cheaters are not directly banned. The game is the best of its kind. However, it is so dominated by the deficiencies that you quickly lose your mind. Especially when you hear that Pubg turned over 750 million dollars last year, you might think that they have enough money to fix these problems. Pubg threatens to experience the same fate as DayZ. First the hype, then forget it. The developers are also making the mistake that the DayZ developers made, they keep moving away from their playerbase instead of responding to their wishes.

"This review is strictly from a balance perspective. If you just want to play as Silent Hill characters then go ahead and buy this. I never played any Silent Hill game but I just feel like their inclusion is pretty faithful to the series they came from. TL;DR: Killer is not good and more importantly not even fun to play. Wait for the devs to change him. Why I don't recommend this killer:  Is he good? No, not really. But that's not why I don't recommend him. The main reason is that he is boring to play. Just simply not fun. His main power is an attack that hits survivors in front of you to a certain distance. It can also go through walls. So far his power is pretty good, but wait there's more. First thing is that when you go to the stance of using your power you can't go backwards and turning right and left is really wonky. Second thing is that the hitbox is very narrow and easy to dodge and after you use it you will slow down for a bit and give the survivors enough time to go far away. The most effective use of this power is to use it when a survivor is locked in an animation like vaulting or dropping pallets. So then the survivors get trapped in this scenario where if they get locked in an animation they'll get hit by your power and if they don't vault or drop pallets then you can cancel your power and attack them normally with M1. This will make it so faking your power is better than actually using it MOST of the time. And if you care about bloodpoints then he's not even good at that because to get deviousness points you need to hit survivors with your power. His other power is leaving a trail of torment which when the survivor walks or runs (If they crouch then it won't effect them) on they'll get the torment status effect. If you down a survivor that is tormented then instead of grabbing them and hooking them you can immediately send them to a cage far away from you. The cage is basically the same as hook but is faster than grabbing them and hooking them. The bad thing is you don't activate your perks that rely on hooking like pop goes the weasel. Anther difference is when the survivor is in their second hook/cage state then instead of mashing they'll need to do skillchecks. Lastly, if you down a tormented survivor who is dead on hook then you can immediately kill them. In my opinion this torment thing is very underwhelming. You can counter decisive strike I guess by sending them to a cage instead of hooking them but they need to step on the torment trail in the first place. Now I'm not saying you can't do fun stuff with him. If you manage to get nurse's calling on him then you can snipe survivors when they heal through walls which is pretty fun. if you use the perk I'm all ears you can kinda do the same thing too. But I don't think these moments are worth it in the end. ",False,False

"Geometry Dash perceptively employs a computative two-dimensional ""trial and error"" system and masquerades it as a rhythmically inclined arcade platformer that jumps into the mathematic realms of tedium. WHAT I LIKED: + Pick up and play. Geometry Dash, at its core, is an arcade game. One can simply choose a level dependent on their skill level, literally jump in and hope to complete it in what seems like a relatively swift turnaround. A rapid time-waster that never requires a vast amount of time and effort in order to complete the various deviously designed stages. Have five minutes to spare? Play through a stage or two. It makes the game hugely accessible for younger audiences who never adapt to the frustrations the game can cause, and also maturer players whom yearn to test their sharp reflexes. + Practice makes perfect. Robert Topala, the game's designer, kindly implemented a mode in which players can die, die and die again without having to restart the entire stage. This gives every player a chance to complete the level and memorise the sneaky obstacles and hidden collectible coins before attempting to challenge on the intended normal mode. Even then, some of those stages in practice mode can be taxing to complete... + Upload, download, play. Geometry Dash, despite being released back in 2014, still has a thriving online community of level creators and speed dashers. The amount of levels available for players to download and play to their heart's content is incalculably vast, with more still being uploaded as this review is being typed up. Fortunately, the intuitive in-game level designer makes this process quick, painless and surprisingly fun. WHAT I DISLIKED: - Geometry Dash is *not* a rhythm game. Whilst the pounding of techno music, the beats of dance music and the vibrancy of electronic music supply the game's official soundtrack, the levels that are designed around them do not supplement the tracks that accompany them. The player rarely jumps in time with the music and instead have to rely on a flurry of visual cues in order to navigate through the level. It juxtaposes the natural instinct of wanting to cooperate with the soundtrack, and makes for a weirdly frustrating experience. User generated levels tend to negate this issue, however considering most of the achievements and rewards come from the official levels it must be noted. - Vehicular mayhem. The robotic square that the player controls, flipping its sides to avoid spikes and other deadly traps, scrolls along smiling away. That is until it approaches a contraption that changes its shape into another classification of vehicular transportation. Flying saucer, space rocket, two-legged robotic dinosaur thing and many more. Problem is, they each employ a new control scheme that the player has to instantly adjust to before crashing into an oncoming obstacles and saying ""hello again!"" to the start of the stage. There is physically not enough time to react to these transitions and make it through the stage without having to rely on muscle memory. Who has the time for that? - Die, die, die, die...die and repeat. As stated, Geometry Dash relies on a ""trial and error"" mechanic in order for players to fully navigate each stage. The easier difficulties will require less time and effort, most likely being completed in one go (if you're skilled enough). The harder difficulties, as their categorisations might suggest, is near impossible to complete on a first try. Nor a second try. Nor a third try. Perhaps the hundredth attempt? The level design relies on memorisation of each obstacle as it arrives, where one simple slip up will send the player catapulting to the start over and over again. That's not fun. That's unfairly tedious. It does not reward players for their reflexes, but rather their capabilities of memorising the stage and persistently repeating the same segment for an hour or so. - Limited reward system. All the official levels, aside from two or three, are unlocked and available for players to jump into immediately. This means the rewards players earn for completing stages are only used to purchase cosmetic alterations, including new colours and shapes. Considering the struggle to complete the most challenging of levels, the available rewards are lacklustre and do not insight any motivation. Perhaps only to bang one's forehead onto their desk?

"Hellblade: Senuas Sacrifice is a video game created by Ninja Theory, known for other projects such as Heavenly Sword, Enslaved and the not very well received DmC: Devil May Cry; on a journey about the mind of a character broken with a noble purpose that takes her to the most remote places of the underworld of Norse mythology. * Amazing graphics: beautiful and other grotesque. * Good combat system. Functional but uninspired. * Linear and repetitive. No replayable value. * Very pronounced disparity between the gameplay and what the game ""wants"" to tell. * The way you treat psychosis. (SEE BELOW) Never expect much from Hellblade, to be honest. Since the day my interest was announced I escalated somewhat more because of the fact that Ninja Theory was going to be behind this even though their games (especially the latest in the community) are not great games that are memorable or have a certain charm. specific. To be honest, my only reason for which I was interested was because it was going to be another hack 'n slash, with which they complied with that section having a not very visceral combat but not a show of lights and sparks, I would say something else "" raw"". What I DIDN'T EXPECT from the game is its intention, or rather its flaccid structure. To say that it is a walking simulator with fights in between and the odd puzzle is to be too generous, but at the same time what the game really offers, above all the great fragmentation between the gameplay and the cinematics. Of course, the game compensates for those few points to emphasize with some extremely beautiful scenarios and with others that will leave your mouth open. The story ... well, it's there unless you want to delve into it, but let's say it's ""understandable"" taking into account that we know little and nothing about the world we enter, except for the voice records in the game that we they teach some interesting things from Norse mythology. To dry, Hellblade is a functional game when you want, but terrible when you have it. Now, the elephant in the room: the portrait on psychosis. I'm not going to judge the developers' intentions to consult specialists on how a person with a mental illness deals with it in their daily life, but I assume that the game is quite pretentious. The only traces of this disease is when Senua is invaded by the voices of hers, other I of hers, of the other consciences of hers or however they want to portray it, but it is more that and nothing. Yes, maybe the way she perceives the world has something to do with solving puzzles but it doesn't lead to anything either. There is no specific mechanic or treatment in combat or some environmental danger that deals with psychosis, it is more, that it ""plays"" with the player's head and gets into the mind of a psychotic something like "" Eternal Darkness where the game (from a mechanical form) changed in order to confuse the player to panic or demonstrate other types of reactions. I think that, to what is considered a disease where the sufferer suffers from personality disorders or alterations in how reality persists, something more ingenious could have been done to complement the gameplay and above all the story that Hellblade tries in count, whose message is understood but leaving a bitter taste with respect to the entire package.

"I have never seen a solo game that requires you to log in at least once in three days or lose nearly all your progress. I don't think this is the innovation any of us need.  Just to make it clear: your land claim is destroyed if you don't log in within three days.

There is no story. If the screenshots showing players raiding some sci-fi looking ruins led you to believe there is more to this game, there isn't. You build a house and you grind for resources. You grind a lot. Your missions are to collect x of resources, kill certain types of enemies, and reach certain areas on the map. And learn a bunch of skills on the skill tree. You build an eclectic mix of machinery that involves a bed that you cannot use (there is no ""resting"" in the game), a fire pit, a stove (and no, you do not replace or upgrade the fire pit with the stove; there are different recipes you can cook on either, so you end up accumulating what should rather be different progressive levels of equipment with the same function). Resource demands are ridiculous. I have posted on the forums that making a basic axe requires cutting multiple trees and smelting multiple - a lot - of ingots of metals, which is just not realistic the least bit, and the developer just replied that I got the numbers wrong. Guys, you are welcome to go and discover who is correct. It won't take long. It's the same story with every type of resources. You will need to eat like 15 steaks to not be hungry. Any moderately advanced armor, weapons or equipment require obnoxious volumes of resources. But fear not: there is so little to do in this game regardless that you can sustain just by logging in once in two-three days to make sure your land claim is still yours, maybe harvest your crops, maybe run maintenance if you let the building deteriorate a tad. That is about it. Oh, and there is no help. Good luck finding some of the quest areas like volcanoes on your own. The positives? It is visually appealing. But I wish I could get a refund.

"It's very mediocre game, that's the best I can give for this game. There's nothing memorable, that's worth mentioning or even recommending this product. i only had some of fun time sniping enemies, but that's about it. Boring, dead open (however pretty small) world with same locations - some outposts that need clearing by shooting 5-10enemies, when you clear that outpost there's nothing else to do in that area, boring characters, hastily done upgrading and crafting system. You can compare this game with Far Cry 3 / 4 in a way, only that this game is at least 20 times worse. Graphics are mediocre too, very blurry, sh*t anti-aliasing, there's ton of graphical bugs even after all the patches. It's super monotonous game, not even worth buying during the sale. I'd give it 4 out of 10 and the only reason I'm giving it this much is that sniping was kind of fun, for a few hours... It gets boring after 5 hours or so and you'll just probably delete. P.S. It's extremely unoptimized. High-end rig with gtx 1070, R5 1600, 16gb of ram and I'm getting only 60-73fps with some drops to 50-45fps on 1080p, very high settings? Come on, CI Games....

"You may remember I wrote an extremely critical review on this game's release back in 2013, where I criticized some of the game's design choices, bad netcode, and DLC that made it extremely unpleasant to play. Going back to the game recently, it appears that at least the netcode issues have largely been resolved so (yay Relic!) on that part. A lot of my criticisms of the original release have by and large been resolved, though I will still point out some problems in the game. The publishers have taken the action of raising DLC prices on their in-game Store during major sales while giving discounts to make it seem as though you are receiving discounts off the item, which is not true as it is not only unethical and anti-consumer, but is also illegal in many regions. Should I also point to the fact that there are some fairly important bugs that were only uncovered recently despite the game having been released for quite a few years now (one being veterancy gained for reinforced squads). DLC I think is still a major issue for the game, but SEGA being SEGA... Some of the DLC do affect gameplay ever so slightly which can be fairly annoying if you're just starting out and don't want to spend money on the commanders. Last but not least, I'm happy they launched the game on Linux and Mac (though not too glad the multiplayer isn't cross-platform between Windows and the other two versions - explanation from Feral  ). Hence, I maintain my stance giving this game a negative review. ",False,False

"That feeling when I didn't join the rebels. Do you give the right to choose? Come on and play. It's not about this game. There is a choice here, but if you do the right thing, then the game will end in the first episode. No kidding, there will be an inscription - your story is over and credits. Why ask if I want to join the rebels if I don't want to and there is no way out? Is it possible to dazzle on a more interesting plot, to lead the player further without stupid euro sentimentality and without raping the player's brain? (keeping the direction that was set by the customer) But the fact is that from a project, a wonderful project, with a wonderful history, they have turned into a springboard for the protection of these very ""values"". The story died when politics was pushed into it in all corners and passing them, the character will be subjected to ""choice"" and always take exactly that side, precisely those decisions that are determined by the scriptwriter's personal view of humanism, transhumanism and ideology. You will probably be surprised if you do not immediately understand the depth of the problem and say - ""in all linear games like this!"" I repeat - in normal games we just move along the plot, but here there is a harsh rape, subjecting the player to ""choice"" in the style of the last test of K.O.Z.A. from Fallout - who is the smartest and most authoritative person? Caretaker! Four options and everywhere Overseer ... in Dreamfall it will be like this: --- NPC: Do you want to join us? GG: No. NPC: Join us. GG: I don't want to. NPC: Exactly? GG: Exactly. NPC: We will give you time to think (NPC leaves. We are left in a closed cell and we wait for a while) NPC is returning. NPC: So you decided to join our great liberation army? GG: No Titles. --- And so every serious dialogue (in his style, so the ""credits"" are offered to us only once, as a hint of the future: eat or die). I rebooted, chose to join. I represent one of the GG, a nationalist by birth, brought up from the cradle and provided with a decent education, a great powerful superpower in the world of the Middle Ages and elements of steam (steam engines) punk with magic overwhelming. Only by chance, having met an episode of absolute injustice and a set-up, he ended up first in prison, and then the rebels saved him. This is not a spoiler, this is the beginning of the game - no need to howl. On their basis, he certainly joins their ranks (interracial ranks, where xenons are the key force). The first dialogue - the script introduces us to the look of a female xeno. At first, we are even allowed to show dislike for this creature, and a little later, GG almost confesses his love and if the dialogue was longer, they would get married ... Let's leave the dialogues, take a look at what they did to the world of the game - you can still understand the alternative history of our world , where in 2200 the most discussed problem of society remains the rights of nats and ""sexual minorities"", going to the synagogue is a mandatory manifestation of tolerance (yes, we go to synagogue), and evil Germans are eager to seize power so that only whites rule ... that I can understand (no). Simply because that society has passed a certain path of historical development and the action takes place in Europe. But when the same thing, according to the same carbon copy, the events are placed approximately according to the level of development 1000 years before our real world ... this is already too much. And what did you turn into the main GG of the last part, Zoya? I am silent about the fact that she herself was changed in the face, this is a different girl. I am concerned about her nymphomaniac tendencies. Instead of inquisitive energetic youth, we got a bitch who is interested in high quality and often fucks with me ... dialogues and her diary focus on sex. Well, swearing through a word is a very ""modern approach"". There was none of this in the previous parts. We were immersed in a wonderful world, in a kind, but terrible fairy tale! Without details. There is no longer a fairy tale, just as there is no reality - but there is the inflamed fantasy of the customer. No digital evaluation, just bad. ",False,False

"+ Good combat system - Bad story - Pseudo-decisions - The player is led to believe that he has a decision, but the decision for the story, for the world and for the characters is completely irrelevant. If you want to tell a story without the player having any influence on it, then you shouldn't make him believe that he has decisions. You could also say that the game advertises wrong information here ... I like to play games in which you are just part of a world and ""have to"" follow the story, or simply experience it. So have no problem with not being the world decider, and I love to hear / read the stories behind it. Such as. in MMORPGs. Quests and the quest outcome will be fixed when I finish them. Still, I love well-written quest dialogues and backgrounds. But here I found the pseudo decision so annoying that I quickly lost interest in the story. Don't give me a decision if it doesn't matter anyway! The only thing that allowed me to continue playing was the good fighting system. So if you want a blunt hack 'n' slay, you've come to the right place. Even if there are certainly better ones. By the way: The 80 hours of playtime are a bug. I played it for a maximum of 10/12 hours, then the combat system couldn't irritate me as much. ",False,False

"Well, it's a golf game. It's got modern graphics. It seems to have real world golfers, although as far as I know they could be just names on the leader board. I don't think you can play as them. I miss that. I miss the old golf games where you could easily play a round of golf on any course in the game (with many real courses to choose from) and many real world golfers to choose from. I thought that was the point of sport video games. Instead you create your own character and play as them. There are lots of accessories for you character, but most seem to be only unlockable with in-game currency that you have to buy with real money. Because microtransactions are the future. As far as gameplay goes playing is easy and works well enough, until you go to putt. Then you get to use a wonderful guesswork system that can have you accidentally barely hitting the ball or sending it flying 20 yards past the hole. This control scheme would probably work with a wiimote, but not with a mouse. You are forced to use this control scheme because consumer choices are not something big game companies like. In fact there are almost no control options--no key rebinding, only sensitivity adjustment. I don't find it fun enough or interesting enough, and as casual or non player of sports games, I find them to be very disappointing these days. I find myself thinking of all sorts of cool stuff that could be in them that isn't, and may never be. At this point in time, you are probably better off playing a pre-2008 golf/insert-sport-of-choice-here game. This still being $50 despite there being a newer version just seems greedy, and I would not recommend spending that on this game. I got it for $5. Might be worth $20.

"This GRID 2019 is the reboot of the series. Well a reboot on a game of cars I do not understand the principle, but codemaster has promised heavy: better than the previous ones, rivalries between teams, .. of course of course. You can call it what you want but in the end the career comes down to a series of races / events with no real links, it's just stupid and mean races. Level content therefore we are entitled to 70 cars, 100 events and .... 13 circuits. Yes, 13. So we have Forza Motorsport 5 syndrome and you will quickly have PTSD from certain places since they come back ALL THE TIME. Also we start very poor and we do not have the means to pay for nice cars so we will have to do races and exploits (drifts, overtaking, etc.) which will give EXP and money. The first thing I was talking about was the rivalry between the teams. It was OVERSOLD by codemasters so worth it, huh? hahahaha, no. We can hire a teammate who will have such or such skills, will take as many% of the salary etc but in the end it is useless, in some races there is a rival driver, but beating him or not is useless. We also have a nemesis (often someone angry with us because we go too close) but that's no use. No, the only commands we can do are at the D-pad and consist of: asking for the status of the rival (his place), asking for the status of the teammate, asking the teammate to attack, asking the teammate to defend. That's it that's all. Knowing that 80% of the time the teammate refuses to defend or attack, well, it really is useless in fact. We can change teammate and hire another, but given the pointlessness, you might as well say that you will just hire the one who takes the least%. On top of that there is literally 0 driver customization and car customization stops changing the color of the decals, plus you can't even choose a sponsor anymore. Other than that there is no career development like I said so absolutely no depth in ""the rivalry between drivers and teams"". nothing, nada. Let's start with the atmosphere since there is none. The few musics present are frankly generic and forgettable, the sounds are quite good (especially in view of the pilot) and bah ... That's it. Ah no the narrators. My god the narrators. There are Kirsten and Alex who are there all the time and are mortally boring besides being dubbed by amateurs. Most of the time all they do is talk in the race to taunt you when you make a mistake, and your greatest pleasure will be to skip the introduction to the races just to hear Alex apologize for talking too much. Then graphically bah ... The cars are clean without being crazy, the destruction is quite good even if it seems that sometimes the cars are made of sugar. On the other hand the decorations are filthy, frankly. There are 13 tracks and most of them are ugly, the crowd characters have PlayStation 1-worthy heads, the trees are ultra low-res, and the buildings (eg in Barcelona) are textured in a hurry. It's so ugly that it's obvious when racing with the motion blur activated, frankly. How can we do so few circuits and not apply a minimum? No local multiplayer and otherwise we have races with 16 players and uh ... Well, the game would already have to be good enough for people to play it, eh so ""yeah / 20"". So we wait 5 years. Almost 5 years of teasing from an already adrift Codemaster, overselling his upcoming had and that's what they come out with. GRID is already half dead since GRID 2, never did anything better than GRID 1 and it's to release this stuff that they are reviving the license. Frankly if you want an arcade car game going everywhere except here it's not even worth it. ",False,False

"Disgusting game, even mods are not displayed. I liked the system of perks only by the presence, in principle, there is no such thing anywhere, but the disadvantages that you take for the character are always much clearer than the advantages. Luck is generally not clear how it works, there is no use from thick skin, all the same, the creatures bite through. Walls that cannot be pierced with anything other than a sledgehammer are still rolled out by zombies. Sheer idiocy. About zombies in general a separate topic, they are scum, the fifth point from them burns specifically. Although, for the most part, there are complaints about the control curve. I turned the mouse the wrong way - this bitch is already biting you, and even though the bite cannot be cured in the usual version, only mods have a cure for infection that can be done for ""over a million years."" You go into a house in the city, and the roof of the neighboring one prevents you from seeing something in the current one, good work. You go up the stairs to the floor above - there is a zombie. You hit him, you do not see the second because of another staircase that leads higher. Great job. PNG roofs ... well, nothing - a leg. About the system of pumping perks - a bombing topic. You play for three whole days, you train skills for the same ""overmillion years"", and then a break occurs on the server when you beat a zombie. Spark, storm, bite. And that's all, in vain he shook. Make a new character with different features, or you can take the same one that you had before, if you, of course, saved it. In short, not a game, but sh * t. I asked in a circle of people about this game, everyone answered in unison - sh * t. Don't buy this bum bum.

"An indie RPG with nice characters, you play Chad and get a companion, and end up in some place where a group of people want to help and get away from this place yourself.

The fights often seem very hectic and the camera is always annoying no matter which setting you use.

"When I heard about an Alesso Heist through a Twitter leak, I thought it was another practical joke from Overkill. But when addressing serious matters Overkill jokes, and when joking around, it turns out theyre serious. The John Wick pack was free of charge, and the Hotline Miami heist had good gameplay, good content, and wasnt egregious when it came to the cross-promotion. But the Alesso Heist isnt any of those. The heist itself is merely a one-day heist contracted by Bain (who else?), who constantly gives the celebrity of the hour enough shilling to qualify himself as a paid billboard. Alesso signs everywhere, product-placement for the musician all around and nothing but praise is given to Alesso when any serious heister would be apathetic at best. But lets assume it wasnt a commercial in disguise. The layout can be confusing for newer players due to the deceptive nature of the passage ways, never mind the dead-brained AI heisters who constantly get lost. To complete the heist, one must go behind the shops, go to the basement, then to the highest floor to hijack the concert (guided by an insufferable jive turkey), back down to the basement to extract the loot, then back up to secure it. In an undercover run one has to avoid detection in open and windy corridors while in a firefight navigating through the labyrinth whilst fighting the heavily armed enemies. Theres barely enough time to get from A to B without keeping these factors in check. Preplanning is absent. While this can be justified being a Bain job rather than The Dentist hosting the mission, the map is so large that the random-numbers generation that places the assets available is unfavorable. Not to mention the complete lack of spotters or spy cameras which would be useful for someone stealthing for the first time. The weapons included arent much to speak of. As usual the melee weapons are filler and often outclassed by others before them. The revolver sticks out due to being compatible with laser sights, but is otherwise completely forgettable. The Bronco usually serves better in its league anyway. Lets find the positives in this DLC. Obviously the weapons provided make it theoretically higher in value than The Diamond, another controversial heist that lacked any weapons whatsoever. Bag-hauling has been circumvented slightly thanks to the chutes connected between the basements and the shops above it, in addition to the zipline deployed in a loud mission. The music, orchestrated by Alesso rather than Simon Viklund, is also enjoyable. The music itself cannot be adjusted and is synchronized with much of the gameplay (more so than usual that is). Sadly thats not enough for me to declare this as the worst DLC-mission so far, more than The Diamond. At least The Diamond was enjoyable to play without friends, and had a more substantial payout. Those who are complacent in accessing every heist available should only buy this on sale, and not before obtaining everything else. ",False,False

"Destiny 2 is a good jerk off for a couple of dozen hours! It has good shooter mechanics, chic design and graphon, cool music, as well as it's fun to play in co-op ... The first 10 hours. The further, the more you understand that: The whole plot is just a repetition of the same ... You can go through the story quests out of order at all, but, for example, first you go to avenge Keido (frankly not understanding what is happening at all), then you go through the quest to find Keido on Nessa, and then the quest where Keido is killed and you vow to avenge him. Sounds good? The way it is! Quests, dungeons and so on are not regulated by the plot, as for example in WARFRAME. It is very monotonous. Literally, all you do is run and kill mobs, completing daily quests and other quests in order to swing a battle pass. Considering that after the 50th hour, I practically stopped changing weapons (why, if an exotic electro-PP that deals huge damage in e6alo is perfect for my electro-build) and just ran around with the same weapon, occasionally changing it to perform daily actions. The game has a division into classes and subclasses. Three main ones, each of which is divided into three additional ones. But apart from changing skills, they have nothing to do with it. 90% of the time you will just run and shoot. And if it comes to that: in Warframe, the gameplay is many times more interesting and varied. Since, in addition to shooting, there is a good close range, working stealth and good parkour, there are also not 9 classes (of which you can only use 3), but more than 40 unique classes + enhanced versions of some of them and a huge number of a variety of weapons, each of which, if properly trained, can go with you to the endgame. And I have not touched on the donation yet! Well, you know this donat. Currency that you cannot get in a non-in-game way and defective expansions that cost like an AAA game and give content for 10-15 hours. To be honest, I don't understand why people stay in this game. It will be really interesting to listen to people who spend hundreds of hours in it and enjoy it. Maybe they will give me advice, I still bought the penultimate expansions in the desire to get a good substitute for the Warframe.

The Game itself is pretty nice Pro: 1) Good sound engine and every weapon feels unique. 2) Good Performance: We have high fps, nearly no drops and a decent Server Connection. 3) Map Variety: Most Maps are very enjoyable and just slightly edited versions of the older CS/CSS Maps. 4) Many Modes: You can play Battle Royal ""Danger Zone"", Death Match to improve a specific weapon, community servers. 5) Competitive: I am just a huge fan of getting better and better and trying to reach a higher tier. This only made me grind the Game so hard. Neutral: Skins: There are really some dope Skins out there but dont you ever open cases.  Its  scam...I invested more than 500 USD into this Game and got nothing but worthless blue  skins. So just don't let yourself think you can make profit out of gambling...its NOT RANDOM with what you end up. Now, lets talk about the things which made me even write this review. Con: 1) A lot of f*cking cheating players! Some Cheaters play very obvious just to f*ck you up and some play more careful to make it look legit. But let me tell you there are thousands of cheaters in CS:GO. 2) VAC is the by far the worst Anti Cheat System ever! 3) CS:GO/Valve give zero f*cks about the fact, people are massive cheating in their Games. I believe, they rather wait over 180 days to ban a obviously cheating guy, because they hope he might invested money in Scam Cases and Skins...and if they got enough Money they might ban him 4) By the way seems like Overwatch is useless anway. 5) F2P , made even more people hack. 6) Prime or Non Prime doesnt matter...you end up with Cheaters anyway 7) My Steam Level is 42, my Steam Account is nearly 12 Years old, I have 0 VAC Bans and I am still getting those Lvl 0, not even 1 Year old Accounts with maybe 3 friends in their list...seems about f*cking right. 8) Toxic and Troll Community 9) The whole Matchmaking itself! Whenever I search solo, me as a German, always getting matched with and/or against 5 Russians, Turks, Indians, Pakistani or even Chinese Player. Which is just stupid! Do not get me wrong here but the biggest problem here is the communication. You cant play a very competitive Game like Counter Strike with people who cant speak English at all. You cant tell me there are no people playing CS:GO in West Europe.  How about giving a West Europe Player other players from West European Countries like: Germany, Britain, France, Spain, Netherlands, Denmark and so on...That cant be so hard. I already set my matchmaking ping to 50...doesnt work and as I said the connection InGame is NOT a problem. So always try to play with a FUL TEAM or with at least 1 or 2 Friends. So if you want to play this game competitive try FACEIT. There are not less cheaters and trolls but still there are some. Otherwise dont waste your time in Competitive Matchmaking. Ofc you can play DeathMatch or some other Game Modes but thats not a thing for me! As long as this cheating epidemic is going on: I ABSOLUTELY CAN NOT RECOMMEND THIS T-R-A-S-H GAME! ",False,False

"Far Cry 5 was a awesome game, yet it had it flawes as others would point out, was well balanced and slight longevity to it, yet the Far Cry New Dawn seems like a cut down version of Far Cry 5 a simple cut and paste map, added a lot of colour and left the game world at that. Most of the map from the original Far Cry 5 can not be accessed due to the nuclear bombs and fallout, yet to charge this amount for the game seems way too high. This would have made a decent Dlc for Far Cry 5 and close the chapter and get ready for Far Cry 6. But there is still a load of things that  me with this (Shall we call a Dlc) :-)  I am like others who like to explore there game world so completing it in 10 hours or less means you rush through it to get it finished. A lot of the voice actor return to voice the characters from the original Far Cry 5  and some do it well, others are a let down. Spoiler Alert: Father or aka Joseph Seed, is a watered down character, exiled and lives far to the north, he is not the character from the original Far Cry 5 as seeing as the nuclear fallout has cured his need for sun glasses, scratches his head a lot but also has the tendency to scratch his butt a lot. he is voiced by the original Greg Bryk yet this time seems like they cut the voice budget as he seems like he is talking in a bucket, the voice acting is a massive let down, yet seeing other characters 17 years later is a nice touch that some made it. Also seeing as I have not yet finished my play through yet, not once so far have I heard of the last PC from Far Cry 5 mentioned.  Boomer and Cheeseburger are no longer available as they most likely died also Peaches. So you get Timber is a scout, like Boomer and Horatio is a tank,  like Cheeseburger. you also get that stupid guy Hurk Drubman Jr, Pastor Jerome,  Nana a geriatric sniper who uses comedy dialogue to keep it alive, yet gets boring after a while.

Some of the quests are tedious, rather stupid and have no point or make sense, and trust me the 2 antagonists in the game are not needed (They are like Hemorrhoids once you know  they are there you need them outta the way quickly, judging by what I see they have only just come out of nappies and now run a ruthless gang of Highwayman. annoying as heck and in my eyes ruined any good parts of this game. just a cash grab in my eyes.

Is it really so difficult for one of the huge companies to develop a new engine, instead of feeding people with the flawed Fallout 76.

"Welcome to version 3 of Berlin-Spandau! Nothing has changed at all. The developer has once again learned nothing. You start from the final stop, and before the first intersection a street backdrop. In addition, there are of course Spandau objects everywhere. Details? - A foreign word on this card. - The bus is so-so so far. It just has to be patched again because some features are still missing. For example, the ticket printer does not have a night mode, the display in the dashboard is always unlit, so that it can hardly be seen at night. In addition, the dashboard cannot be adjusted, which was previously announced several times. In addition, the Solaris logo is not included in the release version, although the license was probably present. ... and then there was the FPS thing; Even in previews / Let's Plays by the developer and the ""testers"", a bad FPS number was noticeable in heavily built-up areas, such as Bottrop ZOB, Gladbeck Oberhof, Buer-Rathaus. The point is, the developer knew about it but ""couldn't"" change anything. An absolute lie, no wonder the FPS is so bad there. The Bottrop ZOB consists of terrain & invis splines. In addition, up to 11 buses sometimes stop there at the same time. Traffic rules are not observed at all by the opposing buses, as well as everywhere else on this map. The cars keep ramming me from behind when I'm at a stop or a traffic light, the buses ramming me at the Bottrop central bus station because they simply pull through it inconsiderately, people fly over the map, run into buses, the traffic density is clearly too strong at 100% , sometimes kilometers of traffic jams caused by the lack of traffic regulations, and much more. However, nothing has been changed there. Although you knew everything. According to the creator, the map was already ready in August. The release date was only delayed because of the bus (which is unfinished). This time should have been used to check the map for errors. It cannot be that so many errors were not recognized! - The testers also tried to show off stupidly on Facebook or drive the bus on other maps. The argument with the ""50 lines"" and the realism is also nonsense. Of course they exist, but they're so unrealistic. Examples: 188: We don't need to talk about it at all. ;) 979: Turning right after horse market is almost impossible, and the mountain up is much too steep. The coolest thing is the developer's inability to criticize. If you say something negative, he literally sticks his fingers in his ears and does lalalalala; I can not hear you. He just doesn't want to hear about suggestions for improvement that cost him time. And before the mice get here; No, I'm not rushing for the OmSi forum and I wasn't sent by Janine either. I was kicked out of the OmSi forum myself 3 years ago because of a stupid statement. I don't care about the dispute between Gladbeck / OOF either. I am not partisan, nothing. I am only evaluating what I have here. And that's just rubbish in my opinion. Conclusion: Once again, it was all about money. The people were once again **************. Do you want a nice card, then take a look around in the OmSi forum. There are many more beautiful freeware cards than this one for 35 . Good payware add-ons are, for example, the Hamburger (T & N / HC) and Aachen. You pay 35  for a renewed Berlin-Spandau in a fictional version (comparable to ""NewBerlinSpandau 1.4""), and an unfinished bus, which is, however, good in the basic structure. Nevertheless, I would prefer not to pay 35  for a bus that is currently not ready. If you needed more time, you should just have taken it instead of releasing something. ",False,False

"My first acquaintance with Sally happened when I was scouring the vastness of the well-known Chinese site in search of covers for 30 rubles. It was then that these same covers with, um, Sally Face, as well as pins, T-shirts, cosplay costumes, and so on fell on me. The incentive for the game had 97% positive reviews, while the ""like-minded"" ones included Downfall and Fran Bow, who eventually sold the game to me. And at first everything was really good. The visual part, which initially hooked me, continued to please the eye. Sound effects and musical accompaniment created the right atmosphere. The plot was intriguing, left a reserve for the future, the game tried to suspense! And this is only the first episode, and it will be better from now on? Later, the deeper I plunged into the world of Sally and his friends, the more disappointed I became. In many reviews, people noted intelligent, lively dialogues, but, as for me, they, unfortunately, do not cope with their main function. Any topic touched upon by the main characters, be it death or family relations, is absolutely not disclosed, and the discussion dies in the bud. The main storyline from a potentially good horror movie almost immediately slides into a bi movie with a 5 CP. The riddles here are mostly annoying than arousing any interest. Some of them are frankly rudiments that serve to artificially prolong the playing time. I also experienced the feeling of dj vu repeatedly as I went through. Indeed, if you look closely, the author does not shy away from both using self-repetition and borrowing other people's ideas. Here we have a puzzle with doors straight from Prince of Persia, a narrative in the form of interrogation, as in True Detective, and a number of riddles from Cat Lady. At times it seemed that the developer was trying to compensate for his creative impotence with a heap of surreal developments. This can be clearly seen in the last episode, where parents demand grandchildren, and the author has not yet decided who he likes best - boys or girls. As a result, I would compare the passage with a tour of the apartment of a kleptomaniac-hoarder: there is no clear structure; There is probably something worthwhile in it, but it is difficult to find it under a pile of rubbish; You can walk, but why?

Various episodes in which Jonathan is shown from the side. Instead, the location screen simply changes abruptly. Many puzzles have not only been abolished, but also work every other time. You understand what you have to do, but the game does not react to these actions. Restarting the game helps. Simplifying the puzzles takes away the interest of the game, of course. They are not that complicated, and without them the game turns into a primitive interactive film - a dubious pleasure. In the very first level, for example, there should be an oil can under a tree. She's not there. With the help of this oiler, you can solve the problem of starting the water supply mechanism. And without the oil can, the very everyday logic of solving this riddle suffers and it turns out not even a simplification of the game, but its complication, because you have to sort out all the objects as in a typical ""Russian quest"". Didn't expect such blatant hack. And what is saddest of all, some scold these versions of the game, thinking that they were so in the beginning.

"Remember, in GTA San Andreas there was a mini-game where we had to bounce on cool lowrider cars to the music? So, the idea of this game is about the same, only it is implemented extremely poorly. 1.

The buttons are pressed sometimes with a double click or even the clicks are ignored, which starts to be pretty annoying. 3. There are only 8 levels (well, thank gods). 4.

"The truth is that graphically the game is a delight, the mechanics are comfortable and fit perfectly with the Joystick but ... and the rest? To start the story of the Need for speed they were always just filler but the story that they put in this does not serve for more than to go racing and advance in the ""History"" because of course now that you won this one they let me know that you can go to face you with so and so and once you beat so and so, a new race is unlocked and so on ... We will have 4 characters in the team, each one is good in theory for each type of race (Sprint, Race, Drift, Time Trial) and then another 2 will come for some special events, and then one that likes to play with the police bla bla bla bla. The game has a reputation level system that we will increase as we run races (70 is the maximum, I reached 55).  The truth is that being in a race and having to smoke other players who come running another race but on the opposite side more than once made me lose them because if you crash you make 12 jumps, 63 laps you faint for 40 minutes and there you just go back to the race but if the AI crashes in such a way it just comes back, and because I get angry because in the game you can make the other crash and gain an advantage but it seems that the advantage runs for the AI only.  More than once I started the events with 3, 6 or 8 opponents of which none were in the race, that is, if a terrible bug or worse, start the race too far back, I don't know if it will be a bug or the game prepared it like that to ""pair"".  If you don't have a Joystick, forget about this, or in the best of cases, a racing simulator that isn't even that much, because this is more arcade than simulation.  If you don't grab the hand of Drift, Skidding or whatever it's called you're basically going to lose all the races, because this is street riding daddy.  It is always night, and it is almost always raining.  If you don't have a good internet, forget about playing with other players.  The police are the worst police in the world.  The blonde in the game is gorgeous.  The event that is unlocked at the end of the ""Story"" demands IMPOSSIBLE times for the ""Gold"".  The cars break down and influence the races, obviously yours because in the AI cars, even if they ride on a wheel, they go over 250km / h.  As soon as you start the game, you come across the 30,40 levels that want you run to get the piolas even if you don't have a car yet.  Some races with eternal, more than 15 minutes playing them.  One of the last races is EPICA since they all get together, but yes, the race is very long. ",False,False

"I will list all the positive and negative points from the game and give a conclusion. I hope my review helps you. -Large zombie hordes (many zombies) -You can shoot body parts of zombies or demolish them so that e.g. one arm is only hanging on the muscles. -Zombie heads can be shot to pieces -Rare achievements (the most frequently achieved achievement of the game is easy to get and only achieved 2.4% (as of: 30.11.17)) -The running animations are good -Multiplayer is possible -Graphics is good -Much blood -There are no sound options (only Windows can be used to make the game quieter) -No in-game options (graphics options only when starting the game) -On one of the maps, the sun is so big and bright that you can be in Really hurt your eyes -Zombie corpses disappear quickly -Many buildings don't really exist (you can go through many walls) -Many invisible walls, even in the middle of the map -You bend yourself very quickly and hang in the air -There are unsynchronous zombies you can then also be killed by these invisible zombies (only in multiplayer) -To little ammunition on one of the maps -Genade explosions look cheap I got the game for free from, for me So it is definitely worth it, only the game would not be worth  3.99 to me, but got it for me and at a discount of 80%, which results in a price of  0.79. The discount price is acceptable, even if I would describe a price of 50 cents as worthwhile, so almost 4 euros is definitely not worth it. The game was really fun for a while. If you get it as a discount or want to farm rare achievements, this game is recommended. I advise everyone else not to buy, especially at the normal price.

"Another free game from Steam that initially had potential, but due to a series of problems, the game I consider bad. It's not so bad, as I said, it had a certain potential, however, the game left something to be desired. First of all, the game is a poorly made copy of Terraria. You collect resources for building sites that improve your equipment (you still need to build that equipment). However, unlike Terraria, where the resources are practically infinite, in this one, if you build a place and decide to demolish it, you can't get the resources back. The improvements range from wood, stone, iron, copper, bronze and steel (the latter being the best upgrade possible). You need to build the tools of these materials in order to improve your performance in the tasks (also Terraria proposes). You can choose between two levels of difficulty: normal and difficult (the only difference is that if you die in the difficult, it is permanent death, but the enemies and buildings remain the same, without the slightest sense ...). You can select between a male or female character and edit the hair colors, along with the attributes. There is only one dungeon in this game, where you also initially choose how many floors it will have (a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 40). Another detail, equally Terraria, is the choice of the size of the world, where you select the dimension of the map. To add the negative points, the character is slow and the distance between these points is irritating. In fact, the game's progression is slow, where each upgrade requires maximum resources. You can, of course, get all upgrades up to speed in no time, but you need to improve the houses in each process. The character also, if in case you only evolve instead of going to the dungeon, it is possible to reach very high levels without having to go through the dungeon, which loses the fun of the thing. Bugs are also boring. The resources do not reach the maximum if you are using the house workers in a certain function, which should not happen, because you are leaving too many resources in exchange for another one. Every time you load the game, the main items will ALWAYS be down in the inventory. In fact, it is not possible to arrange the inventory. The NPCs that come with the houses are stupid and come with the same basic items that you start your adventure on. The ideal would be to help them with better items, but investing in each one is a waste of time in such a dull game. Anyway, to finish, my biggest problem was a case with the save. I was at level 10 of the dungeon and saved. When I came back, the map completely bugged and I couldn't figure out which space to advance. Not to mention that, in this area, the game was EXTREMELY slow. And each time I saved, the size of the save increased in horrors. There came a time when the save was with 1.5 Gigas! I contacted the developer, however, I did not get help or answer. I had to restart another game. So I decided to do everything on the map and only go to the dungeon when everything was ready on the main map. Whoever is going through this game of curiosity, I do not recommend to spend all this headache. ",False,False
"A simple and short platformer that mimics the console old school of the 90s. And if in gameplay he does this mimicry quite well, then stylistically there are flaws. The game looks nicer than one might expect, but it still remains graphically primitive. Music is not annoying, but it does not leave good impressions either. The plot is at the level of those platformers from the 90s. The noir atmosphere is periodically felt, but almost immediately after that the game itself breaks it. The duration of the game is very low (about half an hour). Bottom line: Rot Gut is an ordinary platformer, not good, but not bad either. Just mediocre.

Considering the timer involved, this is time wasted. Virtually every money-grab Match-3 has managed to at least get the drag-and-drop tile swapping correct. On top of this fatal flaw, I was able to complete the entire game in less than an hour. There's a reason Steam has chosen to label this one with ""Profile Features Limited"". Nothing about this game is redeeming enough to make it worth anything. It should be Free. I play almost all casual games with the sound off, so I'm not even going to bother with that. This thing is $8 full price -- which I didn't pay. The standard tends to be $1/hr. This is so far off base that the ""developers"" should re-think their purpose in life. ",False,False

I see bot almost every map I go and I just confuse that developer let these bot level to 100-200+ - Very lag right now - TOO FEW dungeon channel. You must wait for more than hours to do dungeons or spam till your keyboard broken. - Always gold seller message. Again they can't stop these people even they shout at center of town lol - restricted common feature example normal trade etc. They say it help protect bot and gold seller but outside town bot is more than players ... - Token system make too much different from Free and Pay player. You still can play for free but you will have a lot disadvantages.  - The pet is useless and take character slot so if you play hunter and falconer class you can only make one more character. - Too much grinding - EXP system is bad if you make it wrong you may get struck at some levels for a long time. - Many class is good and fun but they are really not balance for now and we will see most people play same build. - maybe more but I just forgot... Conclusion This is Free to Play game but I seriously feel like it Pay to WIN.  The restricted common system and Token that make to stop bots not work but I think it can stop free player instead. Just say that this is system to make people PAY. I regret buying the DLC and really want refund.

"I had fun in the first chapter, even though it was (understandably) easy, it promised a lot. Levels got more and more challenging one step at a time. After level 13, nothing really happened anymore. It was just the same level all over again. We have four buildings: Shop, cement factory, cake shop (huh?) and a factory. Shop brings us money, cake shop bakes cupcakes that are needed in the factory while building walls and cells. I understand that they have to eat, but still, cupcakes! It does the fit the overall look of the game though, it's bright and colourful. Background music made me smile on numerous occasions, it's exactly how you'd think it would be when looking at pictures. It's perfect for this game, captures the lightweight mood of the game, overly happy keyboard pop music. Based on how many stars we achieve, we are awarded with gems. Gems are used to buy bonuses that are faster workers, faster production and automated resource collecting. This is where the game starts to feel like a P2W game. It's extremely hard, nearly impossible to reach 3 stars without using the gems. It isn't about time management anymore, it's deliberately planned so that you need to use them. It takes away the fun from the playing, it doesn't matter anymore what you do. You are just going to click mindlessly and hope this level would be the last one while boosted by the gems. With them, the levels are too easy. So it's either next-to-impossible difficulty or very easy. The levels are also very simple. Same goals in multiple levels, with slighty different layout on the factories and few different blocks on the roads that need to be cleared before the resources can be collected. There is one positive thing though that engages the player. You meet gangsters and thieves that you must click a few times in order to eliminate them. Thieves bring a bit tower defense-vibe to the game as they slowly creep towards your warehouse. Of course, they became repetitive as well eventually. A gangster for example, appearing every single time next to my resource at the same moment my resource became ready. I mentioned the history facts and trivia quizzes. Facts were interesting to read between every level, even though short ones, just a few lines in a box. There are inmate names, info about their routines, escapees and rumours about alcatrazz. The small quizzes amidts the level then again test your history knowledge about alcatraz, giving you three choices to answer from. These were definitely the most interesting part of the game. Not enough to buy the game though, nothing you couldn't read on google for free. ",False,False

"Uses XBOX One controller. Will be added after clearing. The reason why this review is currently ""not recommended"" is that it is simple and ""it is not very playable due to frequent crashes (forced termination)"". We will change it to the recommended one as soon as the correction patch is hit. From here it will be a review of the content of the game itself. ------- An open-world 3D action RPG set in a world where mechanical beasts dominate the earth. Become the main character ""Arroy"" and explore your own birth and the secrets of the world. Although it is an action RPG in terms of genre, it is a strong work. Since this work is made to strongly feel the influence of various works, I will mention it a little in this review.  Although it is a post-apocalyptic work, it is very attractive because it has a unique world view and is full of originality. The appearance of mechanical beasts and uniquely designed ""mechanical beasts"" running through an environment overgrown with vegetation is even fantastic, and it looks like a giant crocodile that appears near the waterside. Will scare the player. If you dare to mention a work set in an environment or world similar to this work, would ""Enslaved"" be similar? However, there is a drawback that there are few changes in the environment and there are many similar places. On the contrary, in ""Horizon"", the player will visit various locations such as ""Forest"", ""Ruins"", ""Meadow"", and ""Snow Mountain"" as the adventure progresses. Weather changes such as ""rain"", ""snow"", and ""storm"" also occur. The quality of the simple environment itself is high, and there is fun in ""what is waiting for the player next"" and ""exploring an unknown area"", so you can play with excitement. In addition, as a matter of course, changes in the environment are directly linked to the action side. I will do the following about that.  In open world works, it is important not to waste a vast map. In addition to fascinating players with location and footage as described above, this work, like many other works of the same type, takes advantage of side quests and maps to keep players from getting bored, and much more. Activities are available. By advancing the main story, the range of action of the main character will expand. As the range of activities expands, even one move requires not only walking around, but also climbing mountains and cliffs depending on the environment. In such a case, you will use the climbing (climbing the wall) action that is often seen in works such as ""Uncharted"", ""Tomb Raider"", and ""Assassin's Creed"". It's the one that sticks to walls and rocks and jumps. Climbing actions are also used when climbing certain mechanical beasts. For example, in each area, huge mechanical beasts reminiscent of ""Brachiosaurus"" are wandering around, and by climbing them and using the skill ""Override"", the activity of that area is displayed on the map. Will be. Climbing Brachiosaurus is surprisingly difficult, and you'll have to find a reasonably high terrain and jump to them. It's also interesting to find and explore this jumping place. By the way, except for the appearance of ""Brachiosaurus"", the system itself that will display this activity is a familiar system that can be seen in the ""Assassin's Creed"" series and ""Far Cry"". The story changes a little, but by using the skill ""Override"" mentioned above for a specific mechanical beast, it becomes possible to use the target mechanical beast. Since it is a work that can also be used for fast travel, there are few opportunities to operate it, but it is possible to board the mechanical beast that is being used and move the map. As an aside, the activity display and the navigation system around the UI and players of this work are sophisticated and quite kind. It takes advantage of other open world works and evolves a difficult-to-use system. Thanks to that, I didn't feel any stress during the search.  Because the work is mainly action, some people may be concerned about the difficulty level. In this work, the difficulty level of the game can be selected from six to start, and the simplest one is ""Story"", ""Easy"", ""Normal"", ""Hard"", ""Very Hard"", and ""Ultra Hard"". Even if you are not good at action, as the name suggests, ""Story"" will allow you to enjoy the story of the main story without any problems. The difficulty level itself can be changed at any time from the options in the game, so it's a good idea to change it according to the skill of the player. Now, regarding the action side, I get the impression that the elements of ""currently trendy works"" are incorporated anyway. This is not a bad thing, it means that I took the good points of other works and adjusted for this work. The fighting means of this work are ambiguous, and it is possible to stand around strategically. We will select and introduce some important elements from them. The main battle is a long-range attack using a bow or sling. It's possible to fight at close range, but it's not a very wise choice against giant mechanical beasts. In long-distance battles, a skill called ""spiritual unification"" is very useful. This skill has a so-called ""bullet time"" effect, and can be used to temporarily slow down the flow of time. Even if you're not good at aiming, you can cheat to some extent. The writer was very helpful. Well, if this work is only a simple long-distance battle, that is not the case.For example, whether it is people who are hostile to the main character or mechanical beasts, in this work there are many enemies forming a flock. It is better to use ""Stealth"" to reduce the number of enemies before starting the battle. When performing ""Stealth"", a system called ""Focus"" that seems to refer to the ""Investigation Mode"" of the ""Batman Arkham Series"" becomes important. By using ""Focus"", it becomes possible to visually recognize and visualize the enemies on the other side of the wall, which makes it easier for the player to aim for ""Steal Skill"" and grasp the total number of enemies. In addition, this ""focus"" is also very useful in battles with mechanical beasts. The weak points of the mechanical beast are set, and by using ""Focus"", the weak points of the mechanical beast are highlighted. As far as I played in the early stages, I felt that it would be more difficult for the mechanical beasts that appeared in the latter half to hit the weak points. As the game progresses, the ""player's skill"" goes up, so I got the impression that the difficulty level has been adjusted to the extent that it is not unreasonable. In addition to the above, you can set a trap to stun the enemy in the path of the enemy, and depending on the player, you can enjoy various battles in a slightly different way. There are many types of strategic battles and enemies, and new mechanical beasts and hostile tribes appear as the game progresses, making the battle side insatiable. There are many operability and actions as seen somewhere, but it can be said that there is a variety and variety.  There are two ways to grow your character in this work, unlocking skills with ""Skill Tree"" and strengthening your character with ""Equipment"". Horizon uses an orthodox skill tree system, as seen in other works of the same type. You can get skill points by leveling up or clearing specific quests, and by allocating skill points to the skills you want to acquire, you can release useful skills that are useful for battle and exploration. It is possible. The skill tree is ""Hunter"": A skill tree where you can obtain many skills related to stealth battles. ""Yoshiyu"": A skill tree in which most of the skills related to normal combat are occupied. ""Knowledge"": A skill tree with abundant skills related to collecting items. ""Wandering"": Skill tree related to vehicles and item recycling. 4 types are available. It is up to the player from which tree to strengthen. By the way, experience points can be obtained in various ways, but I felt that it was possible to proceed with the main story without difficulty without forcibly raising the level. Of course, it depends on the difficulty level you choose. Weapons such as bows and slings, clothes, and modified items (so-called accessories-like items) that can be attached to the equipment slots of weapons and clothes are prepared for equipment. Since the equipment has a rarity, it is fun to collect and it has a little trehan-like fun. However, it is a pity that the equipment with high rarity is simply more powerful, and the equipment does not have random characteristics like the Hack and Slash series.  There are few attractive sub-characters. Many characters lack charm because the stories of characters other than the main character are not deeply digged. Also, other than the main, rarely the main, the facial expressions of the characters do not change much during the conversation. Scenes that give the impression of having a conversation with a robot are scattered around.  Due to the nature of the game, it is not possible to lock on the enemy, although it is not a bad point. You might think it would be strange to be able to lock on because it's a work that often uses a bow to defeat an enemy from a long distance, but that's not the case. This is because most enemies approach or ""hit"" the main character. It is difficult to operate after entering the melee, and the player's ""melee attack"" system is almost dead.  Perhaps it is the fate of 3D works, the camera gets caught on the wall in some areas, and frustration accumulates. It doesn't happen often, but it doesn't happen when you're fighting an enemy.  Many side-related quests are ""use-based"", and many are boring, such as neither good nor bad.  ""Fellow NPCs"" will appear in certain quests and places, but they are very annoying when they come in between the enemy and die immediately when aiming at the enemy. It's just an obstacle. During play, ""Can you ignite this guy and feed it to a mechanical beast? How many times did you think? As an example, I gave a number of works in the review, but in reality, this work is finished as if it was a good point of many works. While many new and indie works are trying new things, this work is gracefully focused on how well ""existing trendy elements"" are incorporated and sublimated, and the content is wonderful. It's a method that only professionals on the road can do. Except for the newness in ""Video"", it's just the system that I saw in another work somewhere, but in terms of action, volume, play feel, ""Horizon Zero Dawn"" is exactly the royal road, AAA title It can be said that. Unless there was a problem related to ""forced termination"" mentioned above, there were some minor complaints, but I could not confirm any problems that would impair the game experience. It can be said that it is unlikely that you will miss playing. We have uploaded a play video, so if you are interested, please refer to this. ",False,False

"This is supposed to be an art experience, not a game.

I'm in favor of more art experiences on Steam. The platform already has plenty of real games. + No fillers. The game is about as long as it should be for the experience that it aim to provide, which is just a few minutes.  Cons: - Nothing about the game is actually good. The idea, controls, graphics, sound are all poor and don't add up to anything that's worth your time. The music (a single song) is ok, but not as moving as it could be. - Instructions are misleading.  This game is not worth buying.

"Brief comment: A good game ruined by the mechanism, the difficulty is very anti-human, all the mechanisms exist to oppose the player, the playing process is very uncomfortable. It is recommended that Warhammer or strategic turn-based enthusiasts can purchase it at their discretion when their history is low. This game has a more exquisite production level and sufficient content among the games authorized by GW. It is a pity that the game mechanics are anti-human. In the game, players must constantly collect dimension stones on the battle map to maintain their camp, and every battle arranges a hostile battle group to compete with the player. This should have added more fun to the game, but because of the essential difference between the player and the AI goal, this setting is simply a nightmare. For players, because they need to develop their own battle groups and camps, the primary goal is to collect more dimension stones. As far as AI is concerned, they don't have a camp that needs to be maintained at all. All soldiers are sent, and their goal is only to destroy the player. This leads to a weird and ridiculous phenomenon. Every time the player hardly picks up any dimensional stone in the 3 or 4 rounds after the start, the AI will attack you like a mad dog. At this time, if you still want to divide the troops to pick the dimension stone, it will probably lead to the defeat of the battle. Once the player concentrates his forces and will defeat the enemy at a considerable price, congratulations, you are one step closer to the collapse! Soldiers injured in the battle need dimension stones to recover, and camps need dimension stones to maintain. After you work hard to eliminate the enemy, the mission will be completed directly. Only 50% of all the unpicked dimensional stones on the map will be taken away by you. Fortunately, the result of a hard fight is only 50% of the profit! As mentioned earlier, if the AI is a battle group with camps like the players, each victory of the player will weaken their strength. This setting is fair and the playability is also high. Unfortunately, every The AI for a task is a brand new battle group that does not need to be operated, and it is so offensive. This leads to a very high probability of players entering a vicious circle of making ends meet and directly leading to the defeat of the battle. This ridiculous mechanism makes the game very difficult. Victory in battle will lead to defeat in battle, which is really weird. Advantages: rich in content, excellent modeling, very good for the restoration of background lore. Disadvantages: extremely difficult, ridiculous game mechanism ",False,False

"The acting, graphics, dialogues are great compared to 2013. Seriously, it is nice that such games are coming to the computer platform, albeit late. But this game has one big downside, and that minus pulls the whole game down. For those who do not know, the game consists of parts. Each episode takes place in a different time of the main character. So you play the character as 20 years old in the first episode, and in the second part you play as 5 years old. This is what breaks the player from the game. Because while you are playing independent half-hour episodes, the character is constantly changing. So if I play the final episode as the first episode, you really wouldn't understand. This minus both seriously destabilizes the pace of the game and gives you ""What am I playing?"" gives the feeling. This problem will be very conspicuous that in the following years the option to play 'chronological' was added to the game. But that didn't save either. In short, it is not worth giving 63 TL.

"The game was ok at start and followed a logic of checkpoints in case of a fail which it followed until the very end in which the checkpoint was right next to the gate instead of outside where the snow was, forcing me to end it without wanting to and explore that hall more. So because it didn't follow the safety logic until the end and made you force end the game without your volition I wanted to give it a 8/10 but won't, I give it a 6/10, that was something that ruined my experience of it and got me extremely annoyed by it doing that. In order to go back and do it you need to redo the whole game, no, I am uninstalling it right now and I hope the programmers fix such stupid rookies mistakes in the future. I mean come on, the real exit was like 20 meters ahead of you but you put the script to end the game and not allowing even a checkpoint in case the player wanted to explore more, now that's stupid and you should learn from that. An easy fix would be a confirmation to end the game too. That gate ending right as soon as you step out angered me extremely because I was returning back towards the hall too, just came around it to see if there is something on the other side. Won't be trying the second game because of that, unless it gets fixed, only then will I even consider it. ",False,False

"Some absolutely garbage design decisions get a ""No"" from me.   The majority of negative reviews echo my own thoughts on this game, but there is one major bad decision that is the nail in the coffin. At the end of the main world 1, there is an escape sequence, where you have to escape a giant tree verticially which is filling up with water.  Which is about 4 minutes of extremely precise and difficult platforming, with no checkpoints.  You die and you have to do the entire thing over. What makes this particularly frustrating is that the ""platforming"" involves jumping ""off"" of moving projectiles.  Which move at a fairly speedy pace.  Miss once, start the whole section again. Apparently, there's two more of these such moronic sequences for each of the two later worlds.  Frustrating and unfun.  I did actually beat this section that I'm complaining about, but it's unforgivably terrible.  Not recommended. EDIT:  I just beat the game.  Yes, these annoying chase sequences still happen.  On the whole, the game was frustrating and not fun.  I persisted because the overall vibe of the game was good in terms of design and music, but overall I can't say my playthrough was a positive one.

Greetings. I received this product for free and was thoroughly disappointed with the gift I received. For starters the GUI (Graphical User Interface) was of shabby quality. The ear-rape intro music is enough decibels to literally blast you off your chair. When opening the game I advise you to turn the game volume down to one via the Sound Control Panel. Additionally the game extremely boring causing me to leave immediately after the tutorial. I do not recommend this game to anyone who's brain has not rotted and does not want to decompose where they sit. Play at your own peril. ,False,False

"For a player who has already played almost 300 hours, and has also gone through all the events in almost 4 years. I can say that half of the game is built on DLC - which you have to buy. And since now you cannot buy DLC separately, you will have to buy ULTIMATE EDITION. And no, don't think that I'm just bombing because I don't have these DLCs. I have all the DLCs. At the same time, after a while the game gets boring. And having spent almost 1200 rubles (for which you can buy really top toys). We can say that the game is not worth the money. If you got it for free, you are a lucky person, but I still don't recommend buying ULTIMATE EDITION. Conclusion: Previously, the game cost 400 rubles, and it was worth it. Now added skins, a lot of DLC. And ULTIMATE EDITION. So at the moment - the game is not worth its 1200 rubles. ",False,False

"Paladins, a freebie version of Overwatch but with much more characters. Annoying thing? You gotta buy the champion pack with $$ or play tons of matches just to buy that one champion. While a freebie, it's still surprisingly fun with the biggest issue being it's matchmaking. PROS - Wide variety of heroes to keep the player interested, assuming you don't mind it's balancing problems. - Certain skins can be obtained for free - The game runs smoothly, however an unexpected crash may happen from time to time. - Auto-purchase towards passives you can obtain in each game, based on how well you do. So if ur on the losing side, expect to stay on the losing side as making a come back is more difficult. CONS - Matchmaking is the worst I've seen from any competitive game - Only a small number of maps between the 3 game modes. - The game is imbalanced in terms of certain heroes. One such example is there is a champion who almost has an execute for any champions below 30% hp. Yes that includes tanks as well. - For a competitive game, I've yet to come across a player who wants to talk in game... - If a player leaves, they are replaced by a bot who aims and plays like an Easy AI. Note you don't get warned when a player leaves. - Disconnections can randomly happen and you are stuck in an infinite loading screen unless you crash the game with task manager.  Matchmaking I've put as a Con, I'll give you a quick rundown on how bad it can get, rather suddenly as well. First couple of weeks of playing the game I decided to main Ying while trying out a few I can buy with gold. Few days a go I was on a surprisingly high 86% win rate. After that I've been on a losing streak for the past 50 games now. which has me down to 31% win rate now, in only a week. If non-ranked games are like this, I'll assume it's much worse for ranked. If this isn't a game you want to play competitively then this section of the review shouldn't bother you. Overall The game is fun, just the real question being do you really care about a game's balancing? Would the matchmaking bother you if you went on a rather absurd losing streak? If both answers are no then deffo give the game a shot. ",False,False

"I love tWoM and can't get enough content for this game, but it should work to be worth paying for it.

But until the over a year old bug is fixed (the child just standing in front of a filled up frige and starving without being able to do anything) I just can't give it a thumb up. Also: I hoped for more for the children then just being there and helping a bit housholding. I love the fact that you have to teach them how to do things but a couple of new characters that only raise the difficulity of the game aren't worth the full prize of the DLC.

"""Timberman: All the fun of working in the firewood business without any of that boring getting paid for your labour or getting a reasonable price for your precious commodity crap to get in the way of the excitement of being a rejected character from a mildly amusing and slightly trans-phobic Monty Python sketch minus the catchy tune to distract you. Sounds like a solid concept to me, the promise of hours of fun! Gee, I can hardly contain myself! Can you?""  When I was a child, as the eldest son chopping and bringing in the firewood was a chore I was assigned during the winter months. So believe me when I say I know that chopping wood is fundamentally chore-like. There's a reason why my Dad insisted that I take on this responsibility as soon as I was old enough to swing an axe. It is a tedious and thankless task which nobody in their right mind would volunteer to do. So as you might understand playing this game is extremely chore like. I would be remiss if I did not mention that 8-player multiplayer is really quite fun when none of your opponents are cheating. This does not happen that often, but does happen as have I asked one guy how he was able to chop wood so fast and he said he used autofire on his controller :( And when played on a computer then it's nowhere near as good as when you play it on android. So take my advice and get the Android version instead. 3.3/10 Extremely competitive 2-8 player online multiplayer saves this from being no fun at all. But not from complete and total mediocrity. Oh and the short music loop really gets on my pecs after about 4 repetitions. And if you can't think of something better to do with your hands than play this then you are seriously lacking in imagination.

"84% of positive reviews. Another Assassin's Creed with an attempt to jump over your head. Beautiful world, good graphics, disgusting combat and boring plot. Another cliche in the form of revenge (is not bethesda in the developers?). We go to the goal throughout the game, removing every little thing, and in the last 30-60 minutes we kill historical figures at the level of Caesar. I spent about 30 hours on the passage. 28 of them went through all the locations gradually, completing every question and every quest. But after that I was already very tired (i.e. count dropped) and I decided to go only according to the plot, which also turned out to be tightened in the end (just what is the search for the villain-target for revenge: you jump 2300 meters, talk 2 times and watch a couple vidosikov, then you jump for another 3 km and again talk and watch vidosikov, and already there, at a distance of 600 m, find the target). If you briefly describe the gameplay - you jump to the questionnaire, kill / find / climb people / objects / on the tower and that's it. Monotony is a complete description 90% of the time. Quests ala the witcher 3? Only a pathetic attempt. This isn't the first time Ubisoft has proven that they can enter an interesting and beautiful world, but everything else is mediocre.

"Let's examine his game as one of my friend, who was thrown into the steam market with a price of 6 TL with the ""Turkish Game"" tag: First of all, I am neither a game producer nor someone who works on it. I should state this first of all, ""If you did better then"". I will not be exposed to reaction. At first glance, our game is reminiscent of the games played on the internet sites in our childhood. I can say that it will not grin if we put it in Kraloyun or something. When we enter the game, we see two modes. There must be a STORY. 2-3 sentences written at the beginning does not make that mode ""Story mode"". In my opinion, so little effort has been spent on the game that there is already 1 map in the game, in the story mode, accidentally painting the same map in different colors and even bothering like the 1st episode 2nd episode. not visited. 1 map was made, mushrooms were sprinkled with 5 different colors randomly, we also collect all the mapi like mad calf and collect those mushrooms and combine them with the 1,2,3,4,5 keys and make it a kind of magic, combo or whatever we are doing now. we have been asked to kill ghouls. (Even if the keys are them, I think I will run with the keys w, a, s, d or press the numbers?) There are also 3-4 features other than mushrooms on the map, the most crucial of which is the unlimited mushroom that I know thanks to my friend. a feature. Thanks to this, they put 2-3 on the map, all of them squeezed in the cemetery-like place in the middle. In fact, you may say why you were so stuck and you wouldn't have entered again, but I do not want to delete and shelve the game I started without fulling its achievements. I wanted to finish this game as soon as possible and lift the pole. But thanks to them, they made such an absurd success that you can reach 10,000 points, finish the game in a difficult, normal, easy mode, 500 mushroom ball ... Because of these, the game is not a game and turns into a running simulator. You collect mushrooms like calves one by one on the map, again, if you memorize the features while making 10,000 points, you can only complete 50 rounds, 200 points each round. Frankly, I do not think that even the person who made the game will endure or fold this infamous thing that much. The last thing I need to draw attention to is that when we enter the store page of the game, the game received a ""positive"" note. Although there are 10-15 reviews in total, but here is also very valid in our country, dude, friendly relationship is sitting on the table. You look at the reviews because ""my friend made it. I was kind of boosted with comments such as ""and"" let's support the Turkish game. "" I only complain that someone of my own race uses his Turkish identity as an idiot and puts this product on the market for 6 TL. 6 TL may not be a big fee, but believe me, even 60 kurus is more for this game.

"I bought this game and returned it the same day.  The world design is awkward and the story seems interesting but isn't prefaced well enough in the prologue for the player to have a good grasp on what the hell is happening. Further more, the prologue seems to act as a tutorial, and a very poor one at that.      The fighting is clunky (took me 3 minutes to kill 2 guards because no hits were landing, despite the fact I was basically standing inside their hitbox) and the game mechanics are there but aren't explained. You're briefed on a total of 1 monsters in the tutorial (which is also poorly explained) and then immediately thrust into the open world part of the game with a bunch of new monsters that are very good at killing you, even on the lowest difficulty setting. (I like to have fun when playing games, okay? I don't like the Dark Souls approach, but I'm not terrible at games either.)    In summary, the various ideas and concepts the game presents are very interesting. However, they are poorly executed, resulting in a clunky and awkward gaming experience. This game could be very good with some revisions. ",False,False
"I mentioned this game with my friend today, and I want to write something. As a player who has played for 700 hours, I do not recommend this game. This game has fallen into a loop with the player, a cycle of evil. A long time ago, when the game only had 3 weapons. At that time, the games were basically well received. Until a player created something like a ""stick"". The stick is basically a long strip body, the propeller is wrapped around the body, and the gun frame is extended from the gaps around. Several advantages of the first-generation stick are as follows: First: extremely mobile. It can even be described as a ghost animal, and because of the surrounding propellers and the limitations of weapons at that time, it is difficult for opponents to effectively attack their mobility. Second: The blood volume is extremely thick. Because the HP of the thruster was very high at the beginning, most machine guns and even magnetic track players would have trouble getting rid of this thing quickly even if they shot accurately. I don't need to mention the anti-air capability of plasma grenade. Fortunately, or unfortunately, the production team quickly noticed this thing. At this point, the evil cycle started to weaken the stick. The production team did everything possible. The most obvious are the following two points: 1: Weakening the blood volume of the thruster, used to weaken the overall flesh of the stick 2: The design is easier and more powerful Powerful ""air defense"" weapons (anti-aircraft guns and tracking missiles) have policies and countermeasures, and stick players soon began to improve the game. A new type of stick with a triangular block as the main body has appeared. The blessing of damage guidance technology has become another generation of sky tyrants (du) (liu). I don't know what the interested players have discovered. By the way, planes are lying down in this era! Many players who spend a lot of thought on the air force, using thrusters and wings as maneuvering, can be said to be directly GG. They are directly beaten by the above two weapons, crying father and mother, and the culprit stick is still behind the player crazy output There are still many grievances about vehicles and production teams. I dont want to go into details. I want to talk about another reason for my abandonment: the atmosphere of domestic players. I have stayed in a domestic QQ group for several years. I can tell directly. You, these players even use the stick as a core technology to study. They think that playing with sticks is a great player, and even professional stick players can be group administrators. He said that sticks are not cancerous, and sticks are not cancerous. They laugh at the incompetence of the production team. Can't really hit the stick, while improving the stick or even forming a stick team for the game. I have formed a team with this stick group management player. In that match, I played a lot of damage and was the first in the team. But domestic players also knew that the rc server often caused players to disconnect. Unfortunately, I was The call was dropped halfway through. I posted a screenshot of the record to the group, wanting to tell this player that Im sorry for being dropped, Ive tried my best. At this time, something very interesting happened. This guy suddenly involuntarily accused me of what the so-called ""delay man"" is. , Which means that he feels that my damage is imaginary, and it is completely dependent on hitting the enemy while delaying and not being able to fight back. When I was arguing with him, I found out that all the other people in the group helped him talk to him except for the theater. Because he is an authority, and I am an anonymous player. Hehe, I don't think I need to say more. To sum up, this is indeed a game that the production team is working hard. It is a pity that the chaos of this game is caused by the players for various reasons, and they are still ruling this game. I dont recommend you to contact this game now. ",False,False

Heed the negative reviews, they stand true. Mountain Trap: the Manor of Memories is a bore. Like others have already said, this HOG is a chore to play.  I don't despise it, I've played worse, but the overall issue is that this HOG lacks the very tools that makes these games fun & worth playing. -No Map, which means no fast travel. There are too many locations to be without a map. -The hint button is virtually useless.  -Journal and Task list are practically useless as well.  -Puzzles are a hit or miss. -The voice acting... what is up with that?? Everyone sounds like they're either whispering or recording inside of a cave with a dozen echoes. If there were no subtitles I'd be lost to the story.

"An OK adventure game that could've been great if they simply removed the entire story and dialogue.   Level design, puzzles, graphics, sound fx, etc. are all top notch.  As it is you'll be eye-rolling your way to the finish.  Neither recommeded nor not recommended, Steam's idiotic review system makes you choose one or the other though. ",False,False
"1. This is a good game to be commended. But not as much as she is praised. Reaching the end is a real willful test. According to steam statistics, only 7% of the starting players of the classic version and 9.8% of the EE version mastered the final. Relative indicator, but still. The game, in my opinion, weakly keeps near itself and closer to the middle of the passage tends to drop. 2. The review is mostly about high complexity. I think the low difficulties are really fun throughout the game. Of course, DOS is passable in many ways, but the problem of complexity is not always the curvature of the player's hands. Tactical and Heroic modes are distinguished by reduced vitality and accuracy for your heroes and increased ones for enemies. Also, there are more enemies in the parties, and the arsenal of their spells is much wider. In the first third of the game, this is an interesting challenge; try to use all the tactical advantages - surfaces, bombs, arrows, skills, squad position, elemental synergies, barrels. A lot of tactics, which is great. What you need from the game. But over time, the number of fights grows, the enemies grow stronger and fatter, and the impression of the variety goes away. On the contrary, the action window is narrowed, and each battle turns into a tedious and lengthy simulator of loading and saving according to the same scheme, and small conventions artificially prolong the already monotonous gameplay. It doesn't matter who is in front of the heroes - the king of trolls or the bum from the ditch - if the enemy moves first, consider that you have no chance in most cases. On the very first turn, you will be blinded / frozen / petrified / knocked down / turned over to your side / knocked down / frightened / just plugged with anything. That's where the variety is! In short, you will immediately lose control of the character for at least 1 turn. This is enough to say goodbye to him. Defending skills on these difficulties won't help much. Here's how ""the cube will fall."" A high initiative or save-load will save you until you miss. Happened? Then let's move on to tactics. The battles themselves are essentially the same from the first skeleton to the penultimate battle (the final battle is a separate song). And the abuse of secrecy was transferred to the extended edition, not feeling much of the amendments. Castanul - hid - survived - stabbed in the back - missed - loaded. My assassin cut out everything that is possible in a solo, any part and without the means at hand. The difference was in the duration of the battles, tk. the chance of misses is great. With a success rate of 86%, approximately every second hit will smear. Killing some Boreus for 20 minutes is not fun or interesting at all. The number of downloads decides everything. By the way, the player himself can easily miss the enemy with the mouse, sending the character anywhere. At the same time, the development of the character as you progress is not felt at all; there is no sign that the hero is getting stronger. The increase in characteristics affects a few percent, and it turns out that the first battles are about as stifling as the last. A huge number of talents (once every 3 levels) just for show and will not be required by any class. The heroes seem to be made of glass (both were a ""lone wolf"" with increased HP, an assassin and a two-handed man) and fall apart with any armor. And the armor does not differ significantly from each other; it's more about taste than their bonuses. However, you devote a lot of time to them, digging through the clogged inventory and comparing with each other. Things wear out and break - part of the gameplay. But there is nothing but lengthening of fights in this element. You miss a blow for the sake of repairing, but the thing is repaired - even if by a hero who is out of combat and on the other end of the map, and it is repaired instantly. Then why is the strength parameter here at all? A huge number of things a la Skyrim have been introduced into the game; carry buckets of water with you, take cups, tubs and washboards from the shelves, but they are not really used. Sell - so money has nowhere to go if you loot; to craft something - why? There are many recipes, but nothing is needed; found things will be quite satisfying. Even for a team of 4 heroes, there is always the right thing, at least from a merchant. The plot deflates to half the game. Didn't miss anything, skipping most of the dialogues. But this is not for everyone, there will still be small twists. The system of moral choice urges the player to make a choice not always as he wants to do, but depending on what bonus this choice gives. For example, you will have to kill someone whom you wanted to spare, just for the sake of the desired bonus for the character. Nothing personal. Usually, such karma affects the ending or the attitude of others, but here you can nobly save the world, being downright immoral bastards. In conclusion, I repeat that the game is not bad overall. But incredibly protracted. The negative effects of high difficulties do not bring anything interesting, do not give a pleasant feeling of overcoming a worthy challenge, but only delay the passage for long, long days.

"Now... I guess the best thing I can say about Prospekt is that its concept is well executed, and that there is at least a portion of the game that really ties in with the Half-Life 2 spirit... BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUT 1) The game is too hard, even on normal. I couldn't count how many times I double-barrel shot a combine in the head TWICE before he had to die... 2) The level design, is ludicrous. You are being pitched against waves of combine after every door and elevator with NO WAY TO HIDE. 3) The voice-overs, although high in quality, sound too amateur to be convincing and disconnect the original Half-Life spirit from Prospekt. 4) Buttons, buttons and buttons. 5) The story, which each time triggers an incredibly annoying effect as you recall flashbacks from the past, is underdeveloped, but it's not the main part of the game as it focusses heavily on combat, just don't expect a satisfying tale that will move or motivate you in any significant way. The ending is mediocre and almost a carbon copy of the beginning if you look at it from a distance. I have to say I really welcome and applaud the additional combine machinery design that can be found across the levels, and the smart use of the cubemaps. My favorite level was the teleport level, even though it just repeated the same button idea all over again. Soundtrack is excellent, one of the closest things that could absolutely fit in an original Half-Life game, as much as the actual sound design. I would rate this game a 6/10.

"I rarely write reviews, so I generally know how to write correctly, well, let's start ... I will say that the game does not cost 300 rubles as max. it costs like any indie toy, especially for android it is free. So if you buy it, it's better at a discount. Plot: and yes he is here, not to say that he is some kind of clich, well, supposedly you are guilty of the death of my family, and therefore I will kill you, and yes that's all. But still for an indie game it's something, but not for me, so the plot is a minus of the game. Grapooooon: and yes it is good for a unit, it certainly doesnt look so cool on the ultras, but still its good, in short, grapooooon is a plus. Duration: well, for my first playthrough, I was able to make up for 6 hours (well, because I didn't know what and how p.s. youtube to help), and if I hadn't been stupid, I would have passed max. for 2 hours, but again an indie game, so the duration is both plus and minus. Gameplay: all you can do is eat donuts, run for 6 seconds. , and sitting in the closet is what we do most of the game, but here there are, let's say, puzzles - which are not complicated, but let's say incomprehensible, I found out about the key card in the bathroom only thanks to YouTube, and on android they gave me a game norms. hint, like look in the bathroom, so gameplay is a minus. AI: but here everything is more interesting, I still did not understand how the owl teleports, if it is clearly said that he made them himself and did not endow the magic of teleportation, but about others it is clear, you run around - the cat will jump out of ventilation, and even in this position as if it was pumped in crysis 2 or 3, the wolf is the most common thing that is heart-warming in all respects, like Chris Walker, AI is a plus and a minus. Bottom line: 4 minuses and 3 pluses, in general, the game is not worthy of being incentivized, but only in play markete, where it belongs, so I will advise this game to anyone, but perhaps only to those who love and adore FNAF, and so to no one, generally 3 out of 10 ",False,False

"As much as I loved this game, I cannot recommend it as it is right now. The amount of glitches and bugs make this game almost unplayable. I could go on with specific examples such as many side quests, that are simply most of time frozen and you are stuck at the objective, which exists on the map but not in the world for some reason, like the bees and honey quest, which was mentioned on several forums since 2017 and nobody bothered to fix it. Motigene Gives You Wings freezes the character and you are unable to talk to him to complete the quest. Superb Meat Boy quest breaks through the last cutscene and therefore you are unable to complete it. You can even accidently fail a quest as you get attacked by people or characters are stuck inside the walls. Not mentioning the worst and most frustrating glitch I experienced half way through the first Act - save option being disabled. No matter what I did, restarting the game, killing myself/restarting the level, taking and completing quests, moving from one district to another, entering buildings etc the game did NOT allow me to manually save the progress. It did fortunatelly autosaved after completing the quests, but when I tried to exit the game, the message popped up saying that the game cannot be saved because the character is busy or something like that. Overall performance issues, unstable FPS, many technical problems, blurred textures, invisible obstacles, frozen animations, broken quests and game breaking issues. Sometimes the cutscene ends but the game doesn't detect it and you are stuck in the letterbox view with and not being able to move. It's a real shame, because the game has a big potential, great creepy atmosphere and beautiful detailed sceneries.

"Another game alongside Fallout 76 that suffered a disastrous defeat. I don't like writing reviews, but I decided to contribute to the handful of negative reviews about Just Cause 4. I'm glad I got this game for free and can save potential buyers because the game didn't deserve any profit. Getting to the bottom: 1. Optimization is weird to say the least. I have good equipment: GTX 1080Ti + i7-8700k, and my FPS jumps between 70-144 as with some alpha or beta, not a fully released game. 2. The graphics are terrible for 2018. Ba! The end of 2018. I felt like I was back in the days of PS2. 3. Now for the gameplay issue. For an hour I've been trying to complete the first mission to destroy the generators. I try because the crashes that keep popping up make it difficult for me. I don't know what the developers thought when releasing the intermediate. It was necessary to postpone the premiere, not to charge players for money. I do not recommend. Edit. I completed the first mission after about 2.5 hours. Unfortunately, it still crashes, so gameplay is zero for me. Edit. 2: I decided to diversify the reviews a bit with a rhyme: I am encouraged to play the game by the ball, but the game does not allow me to play - it still crashes to the desktop. I bought the GTX 1080Ti, the i7-8700k processor joined it and entered the days of PS2. I have left Jeno Gothic. ",False,False

"Assassin's Creed Unity can be said to be the main reason why the name of the series was tarnished. The PC port is disgustingly bad. No matter how good your system is, you are definitely experiencing performance problems and the game is full of bugs. Apart from that, if we look at the game, it has a very shallow story. It definitely has a poorly written story. The script seems to have been written in the mind of ""Let's write it as soon as possible and it will be finished"". The character development of the main character Arno has been very sloppy. As for the good sides of the game, the variety of armor and weapons can be the best part of the game. You can personalize the character as you wish and the player has been given as much freedom as possible in this regard. Assassin's Creed Unity is a game that you should stay away from on PC, but it is a game that can be played and enjoyed to spend time without high expectations on the console.

The developer clearly does not care about video games, he just wants to make a quick buck.

The game consists of 3 sounds and one music track, that's all there is, so if you came for spectacular music, leave. And did I mention that they're using royalty free music and sounds? Amazingly, the game takes only a few minutes to complete (*shocker*), so if you want to obtain all 4999 (notice I didn't say 5000) achievements, it'll only take you a few minutes to do so. He's not trying to hide the fact that it's barebones or an asset flip, so sad to see gaming consisting of titles like this. What's even more sad is that he actually hard-advertises one of his game, you stare at the poster of his game and you win. That's it. Also, about the last achievement, you can't get it.

"This game hooked me with its idea that you will be in the role of the mayor of the city and wake up not only to build buildings like in a city-planning simulator, but also to solve the issues and problems of the city. This game has it, but it is not fully implemented. Now let's take a closer look at the mechanics and visual part of the game: - here it is bright, but soapy. The models are all poorly drawn, although I had a high level of graphics in the settings. What I liked was the building models, although not very detailed, but beautifully detailed. - I can't say anything. Some people write that the game is not optimized, while others have it. I think it no longer depends on the game, but on the computer, since everything is going perfectly for me. - I would also like to note that the streets of your city will be practically empty, because when you zoom in to the closest distance, a maximum of 5-10 townspeople and 3-8 carriages will appear on the screen. The models are also poorly detailed, the animation of movement is clumsy, and besides, they tend to pass through each other. - the game has little, so after a while of the game you start to get bored of doing the same thing. For example, the game has such functions as decrees, taxes, financing, construction of a district (selection of territory for construction of buildings such as: industry, commerce, housing) and the construction of special buildings (Theater, police, etc.). And for all this, it is still necessary that the city parties vote, which you can also beg, demand and threaten, so that they vote for your proposals. But even here there are identical replicas. And everything comes to the point that all this is repeated round and round and there is no variety. - Also, what angered me the most, in this case on the Russian interface of the game, the text, that is, the description of certain functions, is very small, which is very inconvenient. The game has just appeared, and it was only created by a campaign of game makers, which is why I want to say that the game came out for the first time with dignity, but it needs to be finalized, otherwise it will be forgotten after a while. For example, add new functions in city management. I really liked the idea itself and I hope that the game will not be abandoned and will work on it. I don't think it's worth buying the game yet, and wait for further development or buy it to support the developers. Better to watch the video on YouTube. ",False,False

"You know what I was just thinking about a couple of days before I received this game in Curator Connect? ""I haven't heard from BMC Studios in a while... maybe the developer finally got the hint that I actually really hate his 'games'. Maybe he finally realized that I don't like him as a person through what he's portrayed with his 'games'. Thank god I haven't had to suffer through that trash in a long time"". Aaaaaaaaaand here we are. True story. It's like he read my mind and decided he hadn't sent me any spam keys in a while. I think what he does to me is part of the meme culture he embraces so much. I think he actually likes hearing from me. In case you haven't noticed, I loathe BMC Studios and we have a history that dates pretty far back... to their first release actually, when there actually was a ""their"" and not just a ""he"". So yeah, after his friends left the ""company"" this guy dropped out of college to pursue making this kind of garbage. The kind of elementary school trash that makes fun of people, but he tries to cover it up by acting like it's an ""accurate portrayal"" or some crap. If you need an idea, look at Coughing Simulator 2020. Gotta live that dank meme culture amirite. So, Not Well, it's supposed to be an interactive short film depicting someone who is severely depressed. Like everything else BMC Studios does, it's badly done in both context and execution. It's 20 minutes long, and you get to watch a guy sit at his computer and pathetically attempt to tear up his desk, chair, and phone without actually succeeding, then you get to watch him shower, then you get to watch him shave. Somewhere in there he pees and finds a hidden present. That's it. That is literally all this is, with a total of 3 interactions that let you ""keep your depression inside"" or ""express it"". Oh, and these options aren't even coded correctly... at least one of the ""express it"" scenes takes you to the ""keep it in"" scene. You had to code 3 things BMC Studios, three things. Let's move on to the film portion. In high school, I was taught about how long scenes were supposed to last, the rule of thirds, good transitional sequences, use of angles, etc. Either BMC Studios never took a film course in his life, or he just doesn't care. Seeing as you could teach yourself most of the aforementioned with some YouTube tutorials these days, I'm going to go with he just doesn't care to make anything that has any semblance of quality or value. With the exception of looking at him laying down in the tub all of the angles are straight on, and there are no transitions. There's nothing but stagnant 5+ minute long shots constantly. So unless you like to watch a guy shower, shave, pee, and sit at his computer then you're not going to have anything that even remotely resembles a good time here. It should also be mentioned that there's incontinuity regarding the tablet that's received as a gift later on. It's on the desk at the start of the ""game"". And the worst part of it all? This inaccurate depiction of depression that's only going to further the stigma that mental illness is only for crazy people and that depression always leads to self-harm. Not sure what he was going for here, the Curator Connect offer came with a note that mentioned something about how he felt when he was 15 and his dad died and he went through a short depression afterwards. However, as someone who has experienced extreme depression for most of their life, I can't say I've ever stared in the mirror and twitched around like a lunatic. Nor have I ravenously tore at my skin, and I especially didn't creepily kiss it after the fact. I've destroyed things in fits of depression-fueled rage, but we already went over how that wasn't executed properly. I mean, you could've at least gotten up and straight up destroyed something, but that would've required effort and energy. Everyone expresses their grief and depression differently, but overall Not Well doesn't depict any part of depression accurately; not its physical properties, its mental state, or even mental manifestations. It simply endorses the stigmas around depression, and that's why I think this is yet another meme culture poop smear on the Steam catalogue. Look man. I didn't like Kimulator, and I hate Not Well. I am a horror curator, and your ""games"" do not fit my demographic. You might find more people who actually like your work if you spend time sending your keys to appropriate curators. I've gone through this gradual progression of absolute scorn when it comes to BMC Studios, and it's at the point now where the next review will be the absolute bare minimum and a downvote. Go get an education for coding and film if this is what you want to do with your life, you will find it to be a benefit.

"Hello everyone, hello everyone. Today I will take a look at a piece of ebony govn - CS: GO! (I made a review from nexy, but objectively) Chapter 1. Pricing Hello Valve? what the hell did you make the game free? This begs the question - did I buy it for 400+ shekels? Oh yes, for the sake of the finished medal, which did not give up to me. Its main advantage is that it distinguishes normal people from cheaters. Well, how would Gabenu say that the prime, which costs 1k, can be received by every cheater ... Chapter 2. Pros and cons of the game. Pros: 1. The game is good if you don't play it, 2. Adequate teammate. More details here. Since ks has become free (useless prime does not count), there is an active increase in stupid schoolchildren, who are distinguished from normal people by one extra chromosome. But still, there are old players. Olds are in place, but there are very few of them in this dump. Shank to meet them is 1: 5. 3. Modes. Competitive, survival, normal, arms race and other slag. On individual community servers, you can find other modes, for example, prison, banihop, team battle, single mission. That's all. Naturally there are more cons. So, the cons: 1. Graphics. For 2012, the graphics are so-so. For example, compare the graphics of CS: GO and the graphics of Battlefield 2, which was released 2 years earlier - in 2010. Although the graphics do not hurt the eyes, it could have been better. 2. Community. Basically, these are schoolchildren from 5 to 15 years old who yell into the microphone, post your mother and take her to the cinema. Don't even try to argue with them - the kick is guaranteed. I dont count the Poles and foreigners, because I dont mention Russian words (in particular vodka, Russia, bear and balalaika) in my speech, then everything will be decided on a peaceful note. 3. Well, in fact, the main biological waste of the game is cheaters. Wak works xy knows how, they fuck him. The main thing for them is to self-judge in front of their fellow cockerels how oxy and cool they are. 4. Artificial increase in rank (boost). Some players, for various reasons, use the services of increasing their rank for money from more professional players. This leads to rather sad consequences, because when a player gets such a high rank and starts playing, his benefit in the team is zero. They automatically become days. 5. The presence of bugs. Despite the fact that the game was born in 2012, there are still bugs waiting to be resolved. The factor is not critical, but rather annoying in a tense game, when any little thing can radically change the balance of power on a particular map. Especially the jaded Nvidia shaders that make the smoke invisible. Chapter 3. Conclusion. Subtotal: - CS GO is when skins on weapons are more expensive than cool gaming devices. - CS GO is when you open 20 cases and get 20 pieces of blue govna. - CS GO is when a schoolboy adds you and starts begging for a gift worth 3500 rubles, giving the argument ""you're rich, what is it worth!"" - CS GO is when you are sent links to Trojans 10 times a day in the hope of cleaning up your inventory. - CS GO is when you are kicked out just because you are Russian. - CS GO is when ""globals"" create 10 accounts each and get satisfaction playing against ""Kalash"". - CS GO is when you learned Polish in one or two skating rinks. - CS GO is when there are more Poles in the competitive mode than in Poland itself. - CS GO is when your advice and questions are answered by ""stfu Russian"". - CS GO is when every third teammate is a boosted silver. - CS GO is when you land all 30 rounds in one and apply 99 in 7, and that one hits you in the head with a random shot. - CS GO is when VAC exponentially bans professional players, but cannot ban a, which shoots the entire team through three walls, while having 2.2 hours in the game.

The game, which is already difficult enough, becomes unnecessarily difficult due to the terrible implementation of the keyboard controls. I have no desire to pay another 50 for a controller for a game for which I paid 14 euros. One of these is absolutely necessary in order to be able to play the game optimally.

"Recommend or not . . . Recommend or not . . . Hmm . . .  Even as I type my review, I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this game.  Did I enjoy playing it? Yes. Well, mostly.  Perhaps the tried-and-true Pro's and Con's list is the way to go.  Then we'll see where we land. So first, the positives: The art is pretty.  The backgrounds are vibrant and colorful.  The sprites themselves are beautiful, and the women are certainly attractive.  CGs are plentiful - especially given the length of the game.  There's obvious care and effort put into the artwork, but is that really enough? If you like Yuri, that's basically the whole plot.  Pumpkin is in love with her boss and wants to sleep with her.  That's essentially it.  I mean, there are some minor details in how we get to that point, but let's be honest; once you realize that's the objective, that's all most of us (guys) will care about.  Let's make it happen! On the negative, the story is insanely short. I was able to complete all the achievements in a little over an hour.  I'm a fast reader, but even still.  Many of them are for random choices in the middle of the game, so in essence there are actually only 4, or perhaps 5, endings. And one of those can be reached in 5-10 minutes. The translation is . . . wonky.  It's certainly not the worst I've ever played/read, but the grammar, verb tense, etc. is all over the place.  Now, I've had games with horrible english be almost a positive for me (check out my review for  ). But this is in that gray area.  It's bad enough that it's distracting to me, but not so far off that it's adorable.  If you're reading this VN in Russian, this obviously won't apply to you. In the end, I feel as though the playtime and general blandness of the story are enough to have me tell you to hold off on this one.  At $4, I'm not sure it's worth the money.  In a bundle, on a 75% sale, or received as a gift? Absolutely worth a playthrough.  But just the once when you have an hour or so to kill.  And you want to see green and purple nakedness. P.S. In the game, hit TAB then type the word 'code' to unlock the nudity options.  It's not exactly vital or game changing, but I mean . . . boobs . . . so . . . yeah. Might as well look at them.

"It all started out great: The game seemed solid and one of the least unworthy Call of Duty of the decade. In fact, the universe, art design, weapons, and mobility are fantastic to the point that if it weren't weighed down by issues that make it impossible to enjoy, it would be after MW and MW2 in terms of quality. Once you have spent a few hours in the multiplayer (almost level 50 already) you will realize what is wrong. To begin with, the game has a mouse acceleration that, at least for me, makes it impossible for me to aim as I have always aimed in Call of Duty. I've been forced to turn the mouse down to 125hz and enter a registry entry that supposedly overrides any possible mouse acceleration in Windows, and even then, it's still pretty noticeable. Add lag compensation (the worst I have seen to date) and that in absolutely ALL the games played, all the players except the hoster have had the ping constantly going up and down, to the point that practically nothing of what happens, is happening in real time or is it true. I have finished 0 - 19 in some games, and I have been giving the shooter theme for more than ten years. Most of the time your bullets do not hit the enemy, even if you are aiming at the body and clearly you should be hitting, instead he kills you in a hundredth of a second without you even having time to react. The other half of the time you get the indicator that your bullets are hitting him, but in the end you die again, even if you started shooting before him, then you see in the killcam, that he was shooting you long before he did. appeared on your screen. The typical melee duel is very common, and you will hear how your knife hits first, but in the end you die and not him. The fact is that nothing that happens in the games is real. Skill has no place, only luck. It's a real lottery, and the whole experience is tainted. I had never had a negative KDR until Advanced Warfare. To all this add several bugs of interaction with the stage that will kill you instead of saving you (like the character not hooking to a curb) and some control problems that will leave you completely sold out when you least expect it (the double-tap to do dodge that cannot be deactivated) by canceling your refills and leaving your ass on a silver platter. I must say that it has been the most frustrating and insulting online experience I have had in many years. How can a shooter that boasts of having competitive multiplayer use P2P systems and lag compensation in PC in the middle of 2014? It is something that I find directly offensive to the consumer and PC gamer. I have decided to park the game (or at least try, despite the wall of problems above, the game is addictive) until they fix the current netcode, remove (or give the option) mouse acceleration and double-tap e enter the supposed dedicated servers that you DO NOT have and that you SHOULD have as promised by them. Also note that it has the most expensive season pass ever, and the zombies mode is only available if you buy it. Exclusive maps and other ""premium"" junk for those who stick around after Activision hit them well from behind. I got dressed and went out the window. If anyone was waiting for opinions on the campaign, I have only played 3 chapters, but the little I have seen so far has seemed wonderful even if I am a minor. The curiosity of new technologies and the power of Atlas (the power of Kevin Space and his character, rather. It is magnetic even in a video game.) These are two very powerful reasons to go ahead and find out what will happen. The main character, Mitchell, looks like the typical puppet moved by the strings of the powerful without having a fucking idea of anything. Topical and uninteresting, although it works as an avatar. If you put the batteries and fix the problems of the game with four patches (you don't really need more), I'll change the analysis to positive. For me it is still a Mercedes with flat tires.

"The game doesn't have much going for it. It sounded kinda interesting at first, but you quickly realize there is zero depth to the game. Leveling up in mining, for example, just yields more types of rocks you can mine, but doesn't improve the gameplay in any meaningful way. The monsters are pretty basic. Skills have long cooldowns and there isn't a terrible variety of skills you can use. Most skills just buff damage or something like that. The game is caught in a hard place, on the one hand, it wants to be a free form game, and on the other, it uses a silly level based tiering system. The two don't mix very well.

It's pretty fun to build and come up with different type of spaceships for mining, or killing an enemy. but it does get confusing because it doesn't hold your hand and explain everything. * Graphics and Frame rate. The Graphics are sharp and clean even the colors and how the neon lights of your ship glow as well as the particle effects. Frame rate does not take a hit at all. which I'm impressed especially if you build a giant monster ship or something. * Rogue like game play. I enjoy Roguelite games so the random loot for completing a mission is a plus.                                                                                       *The Bad* * Same 3 types of enemies. Ones that float and follow you, Shoot and chase you. Or stationary ones that shoot up in the sky like anti air. * Planets. I really hoped that this would have made the game but it doesn't all the planets are empty. there's some enemies on each planet but they feel hollow and I think it feels this way because of the missions. ( I'll explain this more below.) * The missions. What were they thinking? These missions are the same every time. Retrieve an item (Freezer Or ships blackbox) Kill or destroy Something. ( Corp transmitter, Hive, Overheating or pirate mines.)  Explore an area/planet. These should help each planet feel different but they don't. It just feels like you're doing the same thing every time you go to a solar system. * The soundtrack! Why did you guys choose those tracks? They sound grim and you'll hear the same track like 5 times in a row. This game should have an action/ creativity inspired track. *  If you put too many items on one part of your ship it'll wig out and start spazzing out so hard that literal parts of your ship will blow up. Not sure if this is a feature or glitch either way this is pretty lame considering that this game is about letting your imagination run wild.                                                                *Conclusion* This game would be good if it was still in Early access and if it was 10$ But I can't justify the 20.00$ Price point.

"H1Z1: Just Survive I thought this game was worth playing as a survival fan but unfortunately I was deceived the videos and screenshots looked very promising and indicated a lot of fun and lots of exploration possibilities but unfortunately this is not the case. The game starts quite well with no complications. You choose a server depending on what you want PvP or PvE. So I chose PvP because you think everything will be fine, but appearances are deceptive, as soon as you are in a bigger city you collect your supplies, weapons and ammunition, the game smears. Well and good, but hardly logging in again, you are surrounded by 4 or 5 men who kill one and everything is free. That's how it goes all the time with the game and especially with PvP. Well off to PvE, you are just setting up your base, it is 95% ready, you open your door and then someone stands inside and empties all your boxes and then teleports away. 1 day later Base had finished building everything and then the game got too boring for me, there was nothing more to do in that sense. And then bugs and crashes all the time, which cannot be due to my PC. Because I am not the only one who has this problem. Unfortunately, this game is not recommended unless you want to waste  20.

"This is another one of theses cases where I really wish Steam reviews had a ""Thumbs sideways"" option. But since this isn't the case, I can't, in good faith, say I ""recommend"" this game, unfortunately. Which is a damn, damn shame. I really, really wanted to love this game, but I'm finding it very hard to do so right now. I like Momodora RutM a lot and I've been following this game since its announcement as Momodora V and the  that it was. I felt really bad for rdein at the time, and was really glad when he managed to change the project around to become what we now know as Minoria, which at the time, looked really good. Now, I really love the theme of the game, I'm a big fan of anime nuns and the lore is interesting so far, the characters all look great. I genuinely love the visual style of this game and I do not believe it is a downgrade in comparison to RutM, just a different style that's not inherently superior nor inferior. The 3D models all look very cute to me and I love the backgrounds and the occasional 2D art, specially in the Fran chats. Although I do think some of the animations are a little less polished than RutM Exploration and platforming feel roughly the same to me, I think it's still fun and I really like the hidden walls in the game. I also was genuinely surprised to see different weapons with different combos, and I love how there's a trick with the RutM weapon to pretty much get a double jump, those little techs are always neat, even if unintentional However, where the game falls short to me, is in the combat, and it is the most relevant part to me. The most basic enemies in the game can take you out in 2 hits and the level up system feels pretty much irrelevant. It's very frustrating at time because the game simply doesn't do a very good job at all in giving you feedback for the damage you take. I died countless times because I ran into an enemy when I was already at half health, without even noticing it! Because I simply didn't think I would be at such a low health after only taking a single hit from another random enemy. Most of the time I actually died due to this rather than getting killed by a single enemy at once.  The issue here is mostly due to the fact that, again, the game simply isn't very good at making you FEEL that you actually took damage, and in turn it feels unecessarily punishing and awkward. If there was more visual aid and feedback, the enemies could even cause the same damage to you, but it wouldn't be so frustrating. (although I do think it's excessive to die in 2 hits to like the most basic mob in the game, and that should be looked into as well) I realize I haven't played much of the game and I'm not getting too deep into the mechanics here precisely because I don't have enough knowledge yet, but this was enough of an issue to me that I simply wanted to stop playing after 1 hour and a half or so. It was just really frustrating getting my progress stumped by what, to me, felt like very cheap deaths. I kinda get what experience they were trying to go after, but I think the game needed to be a lot more polished to provide for that. I think those things can be fixed, however, the devs are focused on bugs, and soft-locking or game-breaking glitches at the moment, which is understandable. But I do hope they address these issues eventually, because they truly hold back the game from being something potentially amazing, which it could have been. Ultimately, at its current state, I just find myself wanting to go back and play RutM, which I might actually do now, since I never got around to finishing that game. Which is a shame, I feel really sorry for not liking this game, because I know how the devs are proud of it, but I simply cannot ignore these issues, they genuinely damper the entire experience for me.

"The developers have been describing all the innovations and delights of the game for so long and talentedly that all fans of the TES line were eager to try it. At the first beta testing, there were a lot of people, as well as bugs, but there are not so many features. Then there were edits, ""finishing"", corrections of jambs. In general, few people, among those who were beta testers, hoped that the game would turn out to be good, even less were satisfied with the results.

Decent idea with trash implementation.    Once you get up around 50ish orbits all of a sudden RNG kicks in and instantly reverses your direction directly into the cloud of objects you just avoided ending the round.  Then lets say you actually do well on the reversal ... then they throw in double reversals ... either way you're  by RNG.  Game is good for nothing but farming achievements. ,False,False

"Quite boring passing RPG. I tried to pass in the company and without, to be honest, a little pleasure after passing, incredibly tiresome. Childish, cute fantasy, with a couple of bugs and critical errors when minimizing the game in alt + tab.

For the whole game, one weak, vulgar joke in the king crab bar was perhaps remembered, I did not notice them anymore. The music seems to be beautiful, but for an hour for 30 games I even want to turn off the sound of the battle. The plot is ordinary, nothing surprised me, it looks like a cheap Hollywood movie, there were still a couple of interesting quests, but too few for such a big game. Very beautiful drawing of characters, environment, and in general the world turned out to be nice. Geimpley is plugging mobs with a mouse to the point of stupefaction, at first there seems to be effective magic, skills, by the end of the game all that remains is to throw debuffs, and 2-4 more or less penetrating skills, which usually have a rollback until the next battle. Bottom line: A beautifully and cutely drawn fairy tale for children, which has quite suitable musical accompaniment. At the same time, this game has a banal and uninteresting plot, dull gameplay, and absolutely unnecessary and useless craft, as mediocre as some of the abilities in this game, such as hacking and theft.

"WHEN I PURCHASED THIS GAME, AND WAIT TO SEE SYMBIOSIS SOMA AND AMNESIA THE DARK DESCERT. According to the developers, it will be a revolutionary horror that will leave a mark in this genre. As a result, what do we get? 1. This game is not scary, there are very few monsters, and the main character cannot die. And if there are attempts to somehow scare the player, then thanks to some kind of screamers, which is very bad. 2. The main character does not evoke any sympathy. On the contrary, this is an extremely unpleasant character. She went to Yazhmat, who is ready to drown half the world in blood for the sake of her child, with whom she talks throughout the game, which further affects the already dull atmosphere of this game. The most chatty main character in the horror genre. BOTTOM LINE Amnesia: Rebirth is a game that, if it hadn't come out, then no one would have lost anything. Because the game is empty, a template. A stupid plot, which is understood after an hour of play, a stupid protagonist who talks a lot and does stupid things, outdated gameplay that gets bored closer to the middle of the game, little disclosed lore of the game, which gives more questions than answers. Plus, the game has only one - this is the atmosphere, only thanks to it, I passed this game. A crappy product that can be easily miss and lose nothing.

We start in an isolated vault, but we have to flee from there. After we have left the bunker, we find ourselves in a large open world and go to the next town.

"It's very rare that I am unable to have at the very least a single praise for a game I don't like. Wow where to begin with this hot mess of a game.....I mean this game is bad and I mean REALLY BAD! The map designs feel like someone is just painting by the numbers adding in only the most basic and mundane boring, bland landscape imaginable. Oh let's not forget when I logged in for the very first time, I received a machine gun volley of invites from every single random person imaginable. I literally got 35 invites within the first minute of logging in which was enragingly annoying. I could not find the settings menu fast enough to turn off notifications. An option such as that should be turned off by default seeing how a new player could get spammed into the ground with invites before they even put their foot in the door.  My gosh never has a game had such atrocious hit detection/registry in all my years of gaming. Aiming in this game is a bad joke and attempting to aim with ironsights is just dogs***. I lined up a target in my ironsights, took precise aim at my oppenent's head and opened fire like crazy only to find out I DID NOT HIT HIM ONCE! So throughout the match I sat there trying to figure out where the hit detection/registry allowed me to damage my opponents. And of all the ridiculous solutions I've found this has got to be the worst. I found out how to make headshots in this game using ironsights. The trick is you don't aim for their head when trying to make a headshot (I know I'm just as confused and surprised as you are by that fact). You aim either at their crotch or the center of your opponent's chest to make headshots which is a**backwards and makes no sense what so ever. And then there is the blatant hacking in this game in which I gotta say wow. People who hack in this game are WAY TOO COMFORTABLE in cheating. From what I've seen these hackers walk around like ""Yeah I'm cheating....The f*** you gonna do about it?!"" In some instances they don't even try to hide the fact that they are cheating which is amazing in a depressing kind of way. Noticed a guy on my team straight destroying people on the other team with just a handgun all the way on the other side of the map. Not saying such a thing is impossible but to have such a high kill count with just a handgun shooting at extreme distances is not something a person can pull off constantly without cheating. But not to worry the other team had their own hacker(s) as well so I guess the equation balanced itself out in a kind of psychotic way. Shame on me for not noticing this sooner. I get rushed by a guy with a shotgun and realize that NOT ONCE during the entire match has he reloaded or ran out of ammo as he is rampaging around the map which is rather suspect if you ask me.  This game basically took all the elements people enjoy in shooter games and combined them together but their execution in designing around these concepts was done in a very mediocre manner. The problem with the designers is that they don't have a clear understanding of why people like or even enjoy these particular elements in the gameplay. I can only tell you about my personal experience and opinion with the game so if you're feeling brave enough to play for yourself (Who knows you miles may vary) ",False,True

"Generation Zero is an apocalyptic first person shooter. A very controversial game, as well as my opinion about it. I will try to convey to the reader in detail why I did not like the game. To begin with, the graphics in the game are excellent, the change of day and night is simply mesmerizing. Gorgeous picturesque landscapes, detailed robots and very beautiful nature. But identical houses as a blueprint were very disappointing. The game is positioned as a survivalist, but there is absolutely no sense of survival, the character does not need food and sleep, craft is simply useless here. And there is very little variety and content in the game. The character cannot swim in the water, as soon as you get into the water, you will be thrown back onto the shore. What kind of survival can we talk about? The loot and crafting system is far from even the most primitive survivors, for all 15 hours of the game I collected a bunch of different loot, from titanium to threads, and it was not useful to me at all. Unless I sewed a skirt for the character once for fun. So all the craft in the game is useless junk, a kind of illusion of survival. He seems to be, but so boring and dull. You will not be interested in reading the tasks after the first passed island. The idea is very interesting, the first couple of hours are even exciting and keep you in suspense. But then everything very quickly lets go, the storyline turns into ruti, most likely this is because in the game you just follow the tracks and set tasks for yourself. There is no command center that could give you instructions, there are no NPCs, there is no walkie-talkie by which you could communicate with at least some survivors. If you play solo, sooner or later the thought that you are also a ROBOT will start rushing into your head !!! Only he made me play for more than a couple of hours. With friends, everything is more fun, you can gobble up a cake filled with manure for a couple, if there was a like-minded person nearby. Killing robots in a team is much more enjoyable and interesting, but still annoying. For the most part, in 5 hours you will have all the weapons in the game and you will see absolutely all robots, since there are very few varieties of them. All that remains is either to go through a boring and dull plot, or to grind huge robots for the sake of better quality weapons. The first thing that burned me was a bat and a pistol. The fact is that there is a very strange distribution of weapons by slots, if I only have a bat and a pistol, then I cannot put both weapons on the quick slots, you need to choose either a pistol or a bat. But the machine gun, shotgun and pistol can be placed. It somehow stupidly comes out, which is why no one uses the bat, and so this is a very good melee weapon. All weapons in the game have a quality that directly affects their characteristics. At the beginning of the game, as expected, you can only find bad quality. The maximum quality can be knocked out of large robots, there are players who spend tens of hours knocking out, for them this is a kind of goal in the game. The bottom is great. And there is no other vehicle in the game. Despite the fact that a huge pile of cars are scattered around the map and they all flash with emergency lights, as if hinting that the car is in good working order and ready to move, but no, this is just a decoration and nothing more. A bicycle makes sense only if you are going to travel along the road somewhere very far, but walking through bushes and ravines will be many times faster. It is difficult to describe in words how they mocked the control of the iron horse, it seems to me that the developers have never ridden a bicycle in their life. Spectacular fights, beautiful scenery, stunning graphics ... but all this must be accompanied by sufficient content in the game, and it simply does not exist. I didn't want to give a negative review to the end, but there are far fewer positive aspects in the game than negative ones, so I cannot recommend this game. ",False,False

"And now, almost two years later, after I once tried to master this game (very unsuccessfully, by the way), I started it again. And even played a few matches. Unfortunately, I had to delete it right there. Why? That's why. The game is not beginner friendly. Absolutely. Yes, training taught me a thing or two. But there are dozens of heroes in the game! How to learn to play them? And a bunch of all kinds of items in the shop? In such cases, they usually start reading all sorts of guides from other players. So I climbed. But I did not understand ANYTHING. All guides are 60% composed of game slang, incomprehensible to me, a beginner. HOW SO? I'M A NEWBOY, I DO NOT UNDERSTAND IT! Okay, so be it. Moving from theory to practice. I mean, I try to play with other people. It seems to be clearly written that partners are selected according to their skills. That is, I had to play with the same zero-level beginners, it would seem. But it was not there! In every game, beginners are treated with the understanding, ""they say, nothing, learn, I was the same once."" But nooo! Dota 2 players are all pros by and large. Your rivals are constantly killing you, while you cannot kill anyone. And your teammates are outraged to see you drain. They can also complain in support, ""they say, he is such a scoundrel, he raves."" To hell. I have never seen such an attitude towards a beginner in any game. One of the main problems with this game is the community of players. Their attitude towards others, especially newcomers. Just read the comments to the review and you will understand everything. Well, one more aspect. What's the point of the game? Well, I destroyed the turrets, defeated the light / dark. Even pumping as such is not.

Also the devs care not for the long term players because they are more focused on how to rip people off with each dlc they bring out. DLCs on release are really good then the devs nerf the hell out of the killer or survivors perks or play style because of moaning newcomers screaming for nerfs to be done. This game feels like its still in beta or early access with all the bugs and broken mechanics such as hit boxes. Also I was invited to complete 20 games on the vanilla ptb no perks no add on's etc with the promise of a reward. I did not get said reward so I had to contact customer support 4 days of them asking me to provide proof which I did they finally got back to me and said... Thank you for your patience. ROVER have checked their data and are now certain that all users who were entitled to receive their refunds have now had them. Unfortunately, if you still have not received these bloodpoints and shards, then this means you did not fulfil the experiment's criteria. There are several possible reasons for this: - You did not play the required number of valid games - You played multiple games with items/perks equipped - You disconnected too many times - You did not solo queue - You played on the ""live"" build, not the specific PTB environment - You were not invited to the test Their decision is final and we will not look to overturn this. I am sorry for any disappointment this may cause, but we are unable to assist you further with this query. So they ignore all the proof I sent them ie video evidence of all my games steam id and copy of my email and said we will ignore your proof and not pay you for your time you invested in us.

"edit: updating review. evidently its getting some attention, so I figured I might as well expand and clarify. tl;dr edition: neither good nor fun. do not buy unless its deeply discounted. I can not refer this game in good faith. There are 2 major things wrong with How to Survive. Firstly, take a look at the DLC. If How to Survive truly is an indie game, control of the project has been overtaken by greedhead corporate dumb think leadership. Someone (likely 505 Games) has opted to make DLCs out of basic features that should have been part of the basic game. Examples are an extra harder difficulty and a hardcore feature. Other DLCs (Heatwave) resemble what would have been unlockables for games only a generation ago. Lastly there are the DLCs that suggest the core game was released unfinished taking the cutting room floor scraps and selling them off as DLC when they got to them later. I don't know if the nickel and diming customers business model bothers you, but it sure as hell bothers me. The second problem is the game itself. Its not good. How to Survive is a perfect example of the tidalwave of schlock being put out by the burgeonning indie industry. It is an inferior imitation of mainstream titles like Diablo and Torchlight. It tries to be unique and original with additional survival features like hunger, thirst, and sleepiness, but they're implemented in a way that make the game tedious and annoying. The quality is painfully amateur and inconsistent. Struggle as a melee character, but have 2 triple bladed boomerangs and you're so golden the game gets dull. The content is particularly slim. Each island is painfully small. And the game itself manages to be as repetitive as Diablo and Torchlight, but in the most flat, boring, and completely unrewarding manner possible. How to Survive lives up to its lousy meta score. No idea why this game has such an overwhelmingly high positive customer review count. The $15 asking price with the lazy DLCs is crazy to me. Other games How to Survive is trying to be are the same exact price and offer more and better quality content minus the annoying survival gimmicks and DLC. Specifically either of the Torchlight games. Honestly, my recommendation is to not buy How to Survive at all. If you absolutely must take the plunge, as stated in the tl;dr above, buy it when its 80-90% off. That way you won't feel too ripped off when you find out how painfully below average it is.

"Recommend: Nope. Not even for .49 cents.  I've played a lot of indie B flick horror games cause I enjoy the genre. I figured negative reviews or not this would still have something to enjoy. I was wrong.  First I had to use third party software to lock the mouse to the game window to avoid my other 3 monitors but at least it did stretch to 2560x1080. Not that it helped visually. The game is dark and the flashlight doesn't seem to work as shown in screenshots.  A few comparison snips for your own judgement.  Definitely not the flashlight coverage shown in the store screenshots.  In a room with some chairs and a small TV.  The chairs in back light up from all angles, but the ones closest to me do not. Nor is there a ring of light as most dark games with flashlights.  Doors stand out pretty nicely as does blood splatter :D: but you can't see much in the halls to know where you can or can't walk. So lot's of getting stuck in objects as its just blackness.  Upstairs view next to a railing looking down at the bad guy. Makes finding his location nice, but you're still fighting the environment like Pitch Black or The Chronicles of Riddick :happypirate:  So getting past the visual, we have our bad   creature that chases you. Wow is he sensitive! If i moved before he came down the stairs and walked off in the opposite direction he was coming at me. Granted he is slow so you have that to your advantage. At one point he was upstairs and I turned my flashlight on downstairs and he came after me as well. So it seems even if it doesn't do much for you, it certainly helps to conclude your game faster.

"In this game you play the worst firefighter in the world.  The gameplay is awful, everything about this game is terrible.  Its a simple idea but with so little polish it still feels like an alpha build.  Oddly this game is a port from the Vita so one would think it would be a finished or better product for PC but its actually worse.  This game once it got greenlit literally became abandonware the next day with the devs vanishing never to return to the community or fix any of the issues of the game. This game has zero polish making it feel alpha.  The rooms have doors that are impossible to see without rotating the camera.  This could have been eliminated via putting breaks in the walls where a door is but instead they just gave up on game development.  Worse is that the door if you open it might kill you.  If there is any fire on a door it instantly kills the player.  This would happen alot less if we knew where the doors were.  This game has a time limit so all this camera sweeping to look for doors which could be anywhere takes alot of that time away which is gamebreaking for a game that requires a timer. This game you need to rescue civilians but they just fall over and die when entering rooms sometimes.  Other times there can be fire nowhere near them and they still just fall over and die.  One of the worst things is there can be civilians who want an item like a woman who wants her purse.  She will literally just stand in one spot and die if you dont bring her purse. The firefighter literally cant handle fire.  There can be a tiny fire in a room and the heat will build if you cant find it then you just die.  You can walk into a room for 2 seconds and die from the heat.  This firefighter literally has no protection at all.   The controls are terrible.  The camera moves using the same thumbsticks as rotating the character.  This makes playing the game a nightmare because you cant move the camera independently of changing your characters focus.  This could have easily been fixed by putting the camera on the right bumper and left bumper.  but why bother playing the game?  most devs dont they just make it completely clueless about game design being more code monkey than anything related to actual game making.  Anyone can make a game today, 8 year olds can and have and they work better than games like this. The WORST part of this game is if it just randomly deletes your game save.   This game is treated like garbage by the devs who just threw it on steam never bothering to fix anything making this game the literal garbage of steam and like all trash it should be removed from the steam store. The devs dont care about the game and ran away once it was greenlit, so if the devs dont care about their own game why should anyone else care to buy it?   Rating:  0/10  Value: $0.00 ",False,False

"Looking at game-play footage of this game, I was given hella ""EA Skate"" vibes, and that enticed me to buy it. I went in thinking I'd be playing it casually, however, after playing it for as long as I did, the best way I can describe it accurately is if Skate wanted to be the next Dark Souls and wanted to kick you in the nuts repeatedly while it was at it. It even makes it clear upon launching that the game will be unforgiving, which disappointed me on a casual level. The controls are off-putting--triggers to steer/turn your skater in the air, left stick to control front foot and right stick to control back, etc--and customization--in its current form--is hideously limited as it gives you a generic Skater to play as. Until this game gives you the option to have Skate-like controls--which I prefer over this clunky mess--I won't be picking this up again anytime soon. I'd gotten a refund after playing the game for 83 minutes, 20 or so of which were most likely after I'd finished the tedious, bone-grinding difficult tutorial. As it stands, I wouldn't get Session right now. First impressions are everything, and I was left with a bit of a sour taste just seconds into playing. I'd say give it a few months or so. If the game still isn't accessible for a casual audience by then, steer clear unless you want your face to meet with the pavement and run up that hospital bill. I cannot recommend this game to the casual gamer, such as myself. That's not to say I didn't have fun with it. On the contrary. I got used to the controls, but I could not grind to save my life.

"Here is the thing, It isn't exactly the game itself, as much as it is the community. When the game first came out, the community for it was amazing! Everywhere you looked, you could see a player in every map. It was a game where you had to work together to make any progress. You knew the big name players; FangBlade, Tigger, CurryIsHot, etc. The community was there. It was loving, it was caring, it was a game that you wanted to play with friends instead of alone. It wasn't so much how long it took to get somewhere, as opposed to how you got there. Now the game is just too quick and easy to do anything. There are far too many classes, and instead of using skills from each class; (for example, one of the most famous party quests, the Ludibrium Tower PQ, you NEEDED to have at least a magician and a thief in your party otherwise you could not complete the party quest) is now replaced with 'HEY I CAN BEAT EVERY BOSS IN THE GAME IN 2 DAYS BY MYSELF BECAUSE I BOUGHT NX'. It just doesn't have the same player base, and I believe that is the reason so many people are quitting.

I know leveling slow sounds boring, but back in the day the excitement of getting to level 21 after hours of work so you can start Kerning PQing with your friends. Getting your 2nd job took work and then going to Ludi PQ was another fun adventure when you had friends to do it with. Getting tracks and looking for the best 'clicker' to get you into the PQs and what not. It was fun. Someone being level 70 back then was amazing. You'd look up to them. Now you can get it within 5 hours of playing hard. When Zakum first came out, for a long time there was a select few who could even dream about getting a zakum helmet, now everyone has one. 2) Pay to win. They added all this new stuff to upgrade your items like cubes and I don't even know what else. Back in the day the only thing that NX bought you was cool hair, clothes and pets. Now, if you wana be the best at this game, you have to pay a lot of money for it with cubes, and other NX items. 3) Simplicity. This is what is turning me off at the moment. Back when I played, there was only Mage, Bowmen, Theifs and Warriors (and the rare 'beginner' main), and it was awsome. Each class had strengths and weaknesses at different points in the game, and the world wasn't too gaint to explore. The old saying 'if it ain't broke don't fix it' I think. People enjoyed making one of each of the 4 classes (even more if you wanted Spearman, fighter, F/P mage, clerics, bandits etc). Now, when I opened maplestory, I see like 20 different classes at least, and each probably have their own sub-classes, it's just too much imo. Back then it was easy to balance (in fact they almost never had to balance any classes cause they were so equal) but, I imagine with this many classes now, sometimes they get out of balance and certain ones outshine heavily.

"This is the same flawed DOS version! What does defective mean? No matter how difficult you start the game, after the first battle, the difficulty will reset to the minimum, and if the difficulties from 2 to 5 (only 5 difficulties) are not very different, then there is a big difference between 1 and 2 difficulty, and all enemies will shoot worse than yours recruits (of course, the difficulties differ not only in this). Why, then, such 100-story wet reviews are written about this game, calling it the best in the series (and almost the best strategy), when, for example, in ""X-COM: Terror From The Deep"" (which, in fact, is more of a mod) there is no this bug, but the underwater theme seems more interesting? This is a good question) The version on the console without this bug, so also with the ability to open doors without entering inside, was not so enthusiastically received. ",False,False

"I'd love to recommend the game but this wouldn't help 343 to add those missing features that are a huge flaw for a 2019's out PC game (won't come back to all the great work that has been done to it, but here are all the features but one that I'd have added in the game for it to be perfect in my eyes.) -Reporting people for bad or good behaviour, such things that are in game like CS GO or LoL... Doesn't help to get a better community, but it may help to at least make bullies and bad kids being together and people who are there to get fun together. So yeah, that'd require to rework matchmaking and stuff... -Being able to kick afk people who have put something on their mouse to spam left clic. And so a matchmaking during matches because when people leave or when you have afks in team... Well... You know that you cannot do a thing but try to kill people. Games with balls and such are not doable when you're the team down. -Season Pass progress through campaign... I dunno if I just didn't find the option, but when I enabled score or competitive score, it didn't progress the season pass, and that's annoying. I know it's mainly because Reach is my least favorite campaign, but it'd be great to progress through any kind of gameplay. -(from Hidden Xperia's videos) Getting off the controller's aim assist or having two different matchmakings with one enabled and one disabled. Or give mouse and keyboard aim assist too, LOL. (destroys the game for PC, can't make it with an aim assist, sadly). -(The one I'm not sure it's doable, but Halo would 500% get better with that) Custom crosshair. The one from the original game is so annoying because I love the cross or the dot... But this circle is just the worst crosshair I've ever experienced... How am I sure that with that circle I'm 100% on his head or am I praying gods that I'm high enough or centered enough... That's just a pain to play with this...

It's not that it's not fun compared to other games, but I think Icefield is just a scrap of the series. -------------------------------------------------- ----------- As soon as Canglan Xing arrived at the weapon workshop, all the iron wielders looked at him and smiled, and some shouted, ""Canglan Xing, I heard that you are planting mandarins again! He did not answer, and gestured to the weapon master, ""Put in five soundproofs, three physical strength, and one adversity."" He took off his equipment and counted nine inlay holes. They deliberately yelled again, ""You must have been a cat again!"" Cang Lan Xing opened his eyes wide and took out a small notebook to write, ""Why are you so innocent..."" ""What innocence? I saw it the day before yesterday. You bumped into pickled cucumbers in the Demon Gathering Land, hanging and hitting.""

When the manuscript was submitted, it was painted with a big fat ball and a fat man eating. ball. The housekeeper cat asked: ""What is this painting? What is the big fat ball?"" ""It is Yuechen's grandmother chef."" The draftsman replied. ""Where is the little fat ball!?"" ""It's Aibo."" ""But where is the blue star?"" ""The blue star is investigating the veins."" The draftsman looked serious. -------------------------------------------------- --------- Icefield shouldnt need to be introduced by me. Three new monsters for 300 yuan, New World Gold Miner and Osteologist, a dungpit-like place for gathering demons, and shit-like hooks. The R12 beads that cant be brushed... After discussing with the hunting gang, the problem of the ice field can be summarized as a ""rhythm"" problem, one is the rhythm of hunting, and the other is the rhythm of the game as a whole. The hunting rhythm is a problem with the hook and claws. You have to follow the official gameplay, which greatly affects the hunting rhythm. In the big guys words, its like youre playing a cannon. If you hit half of the women, youll have a rest. Okay, the rest will continue, and then youre tired after a few rests, and youll lose your interest after a few rests... Aside from the idiot-like hook judgment, this mechanism prevents the infinite lock and also makes some monsters easy to play. It's a mixed bag. The overall rhythm of the game must be sprayed. The main line is okay for 20 hours. After the main line, I suspected that the production team had the mentally retarded soup of nm Ming Bolong in their minds. I didn't take it out, but I wanted to put it in the place of gathering. High level unlock. Especially Huajia Baazi, a large part of the reason why the father bought the ice sheet is to fuck her, but Capcom told you to eat 100 hours of shit to HR99. Needless to say, the 4G shield and axe left the old man who entered the Juma area and spent the night in the Miasma Valley. When I saw the face of the old lover for many years, I had a small roar and a 360-mouth cannon. Finally, GP connected the two super solution. There is no response at all. I waited for you for 5 years, but you refused to give it to me. I cant think of a game Ive played for 12 years and Im going to belittle it now. Maybe its really the production team Jiang Lang who is exhausted. There is no body. When the beads are brushed, the deer who attacked the beads rammed randomly, and there is no MH4G suddenly. Identified the AV image quality of Man Gong Man Zhan excavating when I took photos with my mobile phone and showed it to sand sculpture group friends or forum netizens. Playing the icefield, I was like a high paraplegic patient who could only move his fingers and was slumped in a chair. A cup of it fell without smoke, and a broken picture for a day. Medical miracles can only occur when mining the map of the Valley of the Gathering Miasma, throwing the handle and shouting silly X mosquitoes, I will power you Gobi. But people, the essence is true fragrance. I really want to throw down the handle and greet the painful anus. I want to hunt my ancestors. Hunter said I wont play anymore, but this game is just like engaging in an object. I clicked on the icon the next day and said baby I missed it. You, and then there was a sudden quarrel and real fragrance. Finish the pass-Xiang; Where is Lei Niang? Shit; When you see Lei Niang-Fragrant is crazy; When you see that you can't beat Lei Niang, you must first liver progress-overnight feces; After the liver is so painful, kill Lei Niang a meal-eat barbecue in the middle of the night; You write the paper, teacher rubs it; Finally, the liver has a black boom, and the shield axe GP rushes-my sister, the father is here; the black boom action AI is completely changed, super hard to understand-my sister is Qiao Biluo; ...... ---- -------------------------------------------------- ---- I often think back to the time when the wasteland was reclaimed 2G and 4G, people were addicted to food, and the ban was lifted for more than a hundred hours (the village and the assembly were separated from each other). Then 4G gave you a guild 140 system, which allows you to slowly practice skills without losing the task level, and occasionally produce the best mining. Although I will never graduate, I think this is what a hunter should be, and there is no end to improvement. On the other hand, looking at the world's bead mechanism, the slag slag glow system, and the ice sheet mechanism, the graduation time is set at about 300 hours, giving an upper limit of equipment. The advantage of this is that it has an end like most games, which meets the needs of most modern players. But the problem is that some weird mechanisms have been set up so that the lack of game content will let repetitive players take the blame. In my opinion, this is a deduction point, and I believe it does not conform to the views of most players. The third prince said he didn't know what the strange hunting would be like in the future, and we didn't know, because the game always follows the times. In the future when leisure time is becoming less and less, and everyone is playing games for playing instead of liver, I am really afraid, I am really afraid that something like this will happen: One day, the blue star will come to the weapon workshop. After a while, I haven't seen it for a long time. At the Star Festival, the weapon master opened the list and said, ""Blue Star still has a wish list that hasn't been done yet!"" By the second year's thank you ceremony, he said, ""Blue Star still has a wish list that hasn't been done yet!"" To Fengshou Ji didn't say anything, and didn't see him even at the Star Festival. People finally haven't seen it until now-about Blue Star will not be in the game again. -------------------------------------------------- ------ May the blue star guide the strange hunt forward!

"Something that catches your eye immediately. The style is at the highest level. Not a bad cyberpunk soundtrack that doesn't start over after death as it usually does. The HUGE and most important plus of the game is that after death there are no loading screens, you are simply revived before the battle. P.S. I have experience in runners, so I know what interesting games in this genre can look like. Here are examples: I played a runner with the theme of the future """" I played in """", in which new mechanics appear from level to level, and the levels themselves are made in different ways. I played a runner with a glove and a well-written storyline """" All levels are visually the same. They all have gray colors. And you don't have the feeling that you are moving somewhere. It's like you are running the same level. This is the first thing you get tired of. The whole mechanics of the game consists of: -> Running on the walls. -> Attraction with a whip. -> LMB strike. -> Dash to SHIFT. No new chips with new levels are added. What you see at the 2nd level will be at 10m. An interesting level 1-2, where you can cut enemies, but at level 3 and further you will have to run around the location in search of a PROTECTIVE SPHERE to destroy it, because while she is actively enemies are invulnerable. This is the second thing you get tired of. We are the resistance that must stop a villain who was previously good but turned out to be a traitor. It seemed to me intrusive, too bright yellow. I recommend disabling it immediately in the settings. it's easier to see enemies without it. To run along the wall, you do not need to clamp W. He runs himself (AND IT'S AWESOME BAD), just jump on this wall. If you release W to make the hero jump, he will still keep running. Here you run along the wall. There is an enemy and an abyss in front of you, so you need to press the SPACEBAR so as not to fall, and then jump onto the enemy. You press the spacebar, pointing the camera down, but the character jumps to the next wall and continues to run. In some places I crashed into some pitch-black ledges and fell, somewhere I flew past the place where I needed to land, because the character's movements are unpredictable. (You have to get used to them). Enemies are gray, they merge with the terrain, but to prevent this from happening, you can UPLINE with a perk so that there are contours around the enemies)))) Pumping seems to be there ... But only it is not needed, because it is somehow useless. As for me, I have never used any skills in all the time, if it was NOT OBLIGATORY to advance the plot. And most people do not use skills in this game, this can be understood by going to the ""Achievements"" of the game and check the percentage of people who received these achievements for using the skills. Someone doesn't care about her. But there are people, including me, who are trying to get into this table (in any game), set a record, pass the level faster than others.

"Textures clip, there are no interiors, no bots, the free-cam mode is nauseating, the lifeboats interact horribly with the player and I just expected a bit more from this. Maybe it was naivety from the fact I am somewhat of a Titanic enthusiast and I was too arrogant to accept the reviews before playing it myself or maybe I wanted to just see why this game has such a divisive review score but what I do know is that buying and playing this game was a waste of my time. There are no interiors in this game. You cannot go inside the ship. Heck, you can't even walk down the two of the sets of stairs near the middle of the ship underneath the third funnel because the frame is too low down for your character to fit through! I was very disappointed in this aspect because I was expecting to be able to 'relive the experience' as it says on the header image and not just see the outside decks. I wasn't expecting a huge story and immense unreal engine 4 graphics but I just expected a little more than what I actually got. I understand that this is a small company and things like modelling the entire inside of the ship and NPCs and such are outside the budgeting range but you cannot make claims of reliving the experience when that is not what you have created. I don't feel that it is necessarily disrespectful to the survivors of the event but I do feel it is disrespectful to the consumers of the product. The lifeboats work and do their job. I have no issue with the lifeboat itself, just how it interacts with the player. The lifeboats will sometimes knock the player out of the boat from moving too fast in comparison to the player's own speed in keeping up or the boat's seats will trap the player between them and it will make a horrible and irritating collision noise. Both these problems could be easily fixed by just providing an option to actually sit in the boat. The free-camera is extremely awkward and difficult to control. It sways so much and just does not feel fluid at all. I was able to get some nice screenshots though once I was able to tame the free-cam and get it to where I wanted it though so this is more of a moot point.  The mouse constantly disappears and renders the menus unusable (first noticed this after the titanic sank and I was sent back to the main menu but started to occur more frequently and in more places upon starting again). Annoyingly, the camera also follows the mouse (when it works) in the pause menu.  There is no quit to main menu. This is more of a point of convenience rather than something that affects gameplay but I still feel it is worth mentioning because it was quite annoying having to quit to desktop and relaunching the game every time I just wanted to return to the menu.

"FarCry 5 - Did I tell you what madness is? ... Madness is the exact repetition of the same action, over and over again, in the hope of change. A project developed by the great and terrible Ubisoft released on March 27, 2018 on all platforms. The game's plot starts in the state of Montana, which was captured by a sect led by Joseph Sith. Killing people, taking property in short, parasitizing in every possible way in Hope County. The protagonist with a group of policemen tried to arrest him, of course it was not successful, several people died and the GG decided to lead the resistance and overthrow all the sectarians in the world, save the world and stuff like that. In short, the plot is shit as always. Cool sectarian stories or horribly written friendly NPCs do not add interest in any way and by hour 10 you start to skip them. Gameplay: As has been the custom recently in the studio's super games, we have a large map divided into 3 sectors. Each sector has its own leader. He needs to be overthrown by various dirty tricks. We carry out side quests, storyline tasks that are no different from side quests, collect collectible items, capture outposts, break the property of sectarians. All according to the behest of the great and terrible Mafia III, Just Cause, all sorts of TomClancy's GhostRecon Wildlands and other terribly annoying and not interesting games. You can also search for treasures and hunt. There is both ground and air transport. The shooting is done well, stealth is present in the game, although very simple, partners have been added. There are weapon upgrades and character customization. Here are just the same upgrades for any weapon. Want a muffler for your pump action shotgun? No problem dude. 8x machine gun sight? Why not? I generally did not understand the meaning of the presence of customization of the GG. Why is she in a 1-person game? You see only your arms and legs, as it were. Constant respawn of enemies in the style ""God forbid our favorite player gets bored"" is terribly annoying. It is corny to walk on the map. This problem is solved exclusively by a complete clean-up of the region, and even then not completely. The towers were removed from the game !!!!! but in fact it would be better to leave them. Running from npc to npc, finding out the location of this or that in-game of activity, or looking for notes and maps to open the mark can fuck ... the dead. At first it all looks interesting, but the constant repetition of the same actions tires you already at 10 hours of play. In general, this is the project that you need to play in a measured way. A couple of hours a day or better every other day. Otherwise, it very quickly risks being lost from your SSD. Graphics and music are made at a high level as always by Ubi. This is perhaps the best part of the game. Outcome: An open world in which you have to entertain yourself. Thanks to Ubisoft for great games. 5/10 The game is worth buying only with a hefty discount. It is generally not advisable to take the Season Pass. With such a heap of variety, not many will make it to the end of a simple campaign, let alone DLC. And the reviews for add-ons from Ubi are, as always, very controversial. P / s: Average project, average rating. The game also has a co-op mode and an Arcade mode. I have not seen either 1 or 2, and to be honest there is no desire. For 26 hours in FarCry, I got tired of constantly filling this resistance scale with the same actions for the sake of meeting the next boss. Ubi, as always, follows the path of pragmatism. We make a medium project with a beautiful wrapper and disrupt a ton of sales. Perhaps even such a construction of the gameplay will come to someone.

"PUBG is a dirty game in terms of hardware load and you just have to say that boldly and directly. Despite known problems with loading the world, the development team doesn't seem to give a shit, so that even with a normal computer, crashes occur again and again, players and their parachutes are not loaded or the houses appear ""melted"". A NoGo so shortly before the release! There can be no question of development with community feedback here. Instead, a second map is quickly being tinkered with, more weapons and the vaulting. Clearly the wrong priorities! After all, you should first fix the known errors of the first map before working on a second one. But money makes the world go round. There are also problems with the network and server connection. Desyncs, lags, etc. etc. Probably also correlates with the loading of the world, but is especially noticeable in response times. Very clearly especially when opening doors. It may be a small thing, but it should also be present in other, more elementary places. However, it is not so noticeable because other factors also play a role there, e.g. when aiming into fights. Added to this is the cheater problem, which is supposedly addressed, but as in the past with Counter-Strike, the config settings can also be adjusted here so that you enjoy advantages - nothing other than cheating. Conclusion Not to be recommended for the price of 29.99 . Because, in my opinion, you don't have any fun playing the game if the said errors keep occurring. This is more frustrating because you ask yourself ""What is this about?"" The current status of the game doesn't change much, because the focus is not on troubleshooting but on expansion and testing - regardless of whether two teams are working side by side or not. Certainly explains the mixed feedback for the best-selling and most-played game on Steam. ",False,True

"In general, I do not like to write negative reviews, especially on games that I did not really expect, but here is an exception. I wanted to play strategy, the choice fell on a new total var, I will say right away, I was not a fan of the Wahi and had almost zero idea of the universe (especially fantasy). But after watching the screenshots, videos, and then, after reading a little lore, I was impressed and decided to buy. And now the pros / cons. Pros + The world of the game, as I already wrote, was absolutely not familiar with the universe. But when I started to get interested, I was very impressed, perhaps, the main thing that attracted me to the game is that the local world here is very similar to the real world of the late 15th and early 17th centuries, that is, early modern times, one of the moss favorite eras. This can be traced to the atmosphere / social relations in the game / technology level, etc. In addition, many states have real analogies (an example of Bretonnia is France / England in the early modern times). + An interesting game universe, it is rather unusual for a total var to switch to a fantasy theme. + Graphics, for strategy it looks very good, the game map is beautiful, the maps for custom battles also look very nice. + Optimization, I did not find any complaints, even in hard mixes with a maximum of troops, all the rules. + Land battles, very high quality, very spectacular, I especially liked the variety and elaboration of the troops, a special type of troops appeared - heroes. + Casual, as anyone, but for me plus, I do not like complex games, in general from the whole series of total var is the simplest. + Support for the Steam Workshop, there are very high quality mods at times increasing the interest in the game. + Delays hours by 50-100 rail. Cons - The most important thing is DLC and their price. Not only is the game itself not cheap (which is a bit too much for it below). I'm already used to the fact that all modern games come out cut down, and then sold in pieces. But fuck what Sega did is just up. Not only did they cut out the KEY RACES, they also sell them for 9 bucks for wood elves, beastmen, and somewhere else 5 for chaos, FOR CHAOS. BUT THIS IS STILL NOT THE END, after reading about the world of the game, I realized that we were just presented with a tightly cut game, you can't play either for the southern states or for the northern ones, we can't choose the provinces of the Empire, Kislev. The game simply lacks the Lizzards and the New World, Arabia, the High Elves, and it is quite obvious that sooner or later they will add everything, but I'm even afraid to imagine how much it will cost. Segi should learn from The Witcher 3, where DLS surpasses most modern AAA games in quality, and are quite adequate. -Little content, the game looks stripped down, you can play without DLS, but if you get involved, you will simply have to buy them just for fun. The game does not look at its price. And one more disappointment, WHERE ARE THE PREVIOUS TOTAL BARS ACHIEVED? It feels like this is the first game of developers. Where are the sieges as in attila, where are the naval battles of the second Rome, where is normal diplomacy as in the shogun, where is the normal construction system that was back in 2004 in the first Rome, but in the first Rome we saw how our city was developing, growing, there was a bunch of unique buildings, but what is there? Barracks-stable-fields-tavern-etc. The tech tree is so-so explored pretty quickly. -Balance, well, this is purely my opinion, but for example, vampires are quite imbibing. That's basically all, but there are not a lot of minuses. But they are very significant. In principle, the game can drag on for a large amount of time, it is still interesting to play, especially if you still buy a DLS, but it seems to me that the game will really be suitable in a year and a half, when all the DLS / add-ons are released before, and MAYBE SEGI WILL MAKE A DISCOUNT. In the meantime, my rating is 6.5 / 10. If you are a fan of total wara / wahi take it. If you just look at what it is, then I recommend either waiting for all additional releases or discounts.

One issue being, The game reccomends 'TEAMS' for you to join, however, these teams consist of people **Most of the time** being level 100+ which means you won't do didly squat to any of those enemies.

"The game does not cost 1000 rubles. 200 - edge. In all aspects, worse than the 5th part, in my opinion. Yes, there is more time for the passage, but not due to the plot, but due to artificial ""sticks in the wheels"". We play with corefan and experience constant problems with the network: delays and disconnects after an hour or two of playing together. This was not the case in the 5th part. Management is over. What kind of fool thought of jumping over obstacles and running one key to do? Because of this, it turns out that you climb the stairs, for example, when you run away from an evil helicopter and anthropomorphic oilcakes, but because of the curvature of the controls, you jump down to them and die. Or you run away in a straight line, accidentally touching a box of some kind, after which the Persian instantly begins to slide back through it ... Too much of a sensation for me, even at the very minimum: for moving from edge to edge of the carpet - 2.5 turns per 360. Inventory also for an amateur. In my opinion, in part 5 it was easier with him. And the fact that everyone has their own loot and emblems, and not common ones, also enrages. Too much action. There are scenes when you definitely need to fire a shot, and if you don't, then the operation will fail. We pass at maximum difficulty. There are almost always no cartridges (why are they when you can spawn experience for us, for which you unlock skills that do not work at maximum difficulty?). Korefan often runs around with a knife. The result, I think, is clear. Grafon: characters are approximately at the same level as in part 5, textures 50/50: part is better, and the other part is complete trash; background prints are of terrible quality.

"Serious Sam: The Random Encounter Does its name justice ... it's random ... We are thrown into a top-down world in the style of the old ""Legend of Zelda"" games. Here we have to solve some small ""puzzles"", which are mostly limited to only collecting a key, or we can find boxes with random objects. At every step we have the chance to meet opponents that are generated randomly (under certain conditions). The fights are a mixture of real-time and turn-based systems. Sam is on the right-hand side and a large bunch of enemies come from the left, whom we exterminate with various weapons as we are used to from ""Serious Sam"". In the turn-based part we choose whether and how we fire the weapons, whether we want to change weapons or use items. Then the game runs for 5 seconds in which we can dodge with Sam and adjust the trajectory of some weapons. The weapon selection itself is not excessive, but has been well met with different roles. Likewise, the opponents are relatively well chosen apart from a few exceptions whose attacks are, in my opinion, a bit poorly balanced. Later you get two more companions who can perform the same actions as Sam. This gives us more firepower, but we are nowhere near as good as dodging, as all three are in a vertical line and you can no longer dodge that far up or down. I think the basic principle is great and extremely fun because it is really entertaining fun. But ... the game is too random. Sounds strange but that's how it is. The opponents are so different in strength and number that certain worlds are absolutely impossible to lock and you lose all your lives, and the next attempt can be such an absolute breeze that we don't even get any damage. The same problem prevails with the bosses. Especially the final boss. I had a few attempts where I could only do minimal damage to him and had used up all my items, while the last attempt was so quickly over that I was totally surprised how quickly it went. I had used the same tactics and weapons and was just lucky as he moved. The problem is further emphasized as the items are also generated randomly, and sometimes you just don't get the things you want or need. Due to this strong trial and error, the actual playing time is greatly stretched and the fact that I was through with the game in about an hour and a half, and also played the second Endless mode (which has exactly the same problems) in order to see if this is better, shows how little substance there is. I think the game principle is great, but unfortunately without a sophisticated implementation. So I can't recommend the game, even for the  4 it costs. If it's on sale for as little as  1 or so, you might be able to check it out, but unless the game is upgraded and expanded, you won't be missing out on much.

"Hidden object game from 2017. 1.650th review in my archive. You take on the role of a mother in search of her kidnapped daughter. Mary came to these remote islands with her husband and daughter in search of their long-lost family roots. The environment is beautifully done and takes place in the enchanted valleys of the forgotten Indus civilization. This is by far the best game of its kind in terms of gamplay that I know of. The logical, well-placed sequence of the individual sought objects is particularly praiseworthy. Unfortunately, there are two critical system crashes. see attached photos. With the first one it comes to a crash if you click on the help before it is active. So it can be avoided, but I don't know if this is not the case in other places as well. The second is the mini-game - harvesting fruits. Unfortunately, you need the fruits to advance in the game. So the game is over for me here. I have tried it 5 times completely by then. The crashes as such would not be too bad, but the saved data is damaged (in several places) which leads to it being automatically deleted. Which makes sense, but you have to play from the beginning. The errors in the game have been known for a long time, as I can see from the community. However, there seem to be players who allegedly have no problems. Anyway, I don't recommend it like that.

The environment is beautifully done and takes place in the enchanted valleys of the forgotten Indus civilization. This is by far the best game of its kind in terms of gamplay that I know of. The logical, well-placed sequence of the individual sought objects is particularly praiseworthy. Unfortunately, there are two critical system crashes. see attached photos. With the first one it comes to a crash if you click on the help before it is active. So it can be avoided, but I don't know if this is not the case in other places as well. The second is the mini-game - harvesting fruits. Unfortunately, you need the fruits to advance in the game. So the game is over for me here. I have tried it 5 times completely by then. The crashes as such would not be too bad, but the saved data is damaged (in several places) which leads to it being automatically deleted. Which makes sense, but you have to play again from the beginning. The errors in the game have been known for a long time, as I can see from the community. However, there seem to be players who allegedly have no problems. Anyway, I don't recommend it like that. Since I have sent all the game data to the developers, I very much hope that they will find a solution to this problem. I played it in German, according to the community, but this is also the case in the English version. Due to various system crash events - do not buy!

"Unfortunately, I will put a minus to this game. although the general emotions are somewhere around 6/10 + + Nice graphics + interesting story + turn-based combat + side quests + interesting game world + nice audio series - - Prolonged character pumping (you can almost say that it is not there) there is additional. gear, but there is too little of it - after 7 hours of the game, the same type of battles begin to tire (and since the squad is developing very slowly, it is better to say that it is permanent, there are essentially no new tactics). It would seem that there are 6 pluses and only two minuses, but these minuses are very bold and they kill interest in the game, it is better to read a cool story in a book. Yes, even with all the simplicity and cartoonishness of the graphics, the laptop begins to boil, as with the second X-com on a high graph.The final dislike is more likely to lower the rating of the game in the incentive, since 78% in my opinion is an overestimated and unjustified estimate. 56 on meta criticism - more like my feelings ",False,False

"Very bad impression in first few games.. Simply put its gameplay trash compared to FIFA, there's no control on ball whatsoever, no fluidity.. players take so much time to pass the ball that it gets snatched if you pass it in the last moments... only bcoz your player took too much time to pass the ball.. even when you pressed the button earlier. No proper responsiveness. Also it feels like controls are messed up, there's no accuracy on ball control, you do one thing but sometime you end up off the target bcoz of either inaccuracy or slow responsiveness. When you want to shoot the ball in the net after a pass through, your shot button will only response when your striker catches up & touches the ball, only then your player will prepare to shoot... which takes too much time to take the shot, obviously you don't have that much time your opponent's goal territory. If you press shoot button early (even while you are about to catch up the ball), even if your player is a few inches away from ball, your striker will give up the ball & let it go to either goalkeeper or outside, missing a very good opportunity to score as if player is not interested in scoring the goal at all... All bcoz of the lack of responsiveness OR gameplay mechanics are like this. Only graphics are ""slightly"" better than FIFA but i doubt anyone cares about graphics in a Football game, all that matters is a football game is ""gameplay"". And yeah these are the things i have observed in 3-4 games in just 50 minutes of gameplay.. i felt the difference right away compared to FIFA. FIFA is wayyyy much better, either in terms of responsiveness, accuracy, fluidity, moves, online system (Ultimate Team) etc.. ",False,False

Rating: 2/5 I brought this game because of the overwhelming amount of positive reviews but it turns out to be disappointing. The kind of game play it has reminds me of games I used to play on mobiles 10 years back. And I wonder what made developers to think of such old mobile  gaming concept to PC. I've only played this for few hours but I already feel kinda bored.  First of all you play the game viewing from top. So you cant even see characters properly. Secondly almost 80% of game is you driving around and racing. The rest of the game is blowing  around and stealing things. All that driving around and navigating is already putting a strain on my hand and that's exactly what I hate about these top view games. Some people might find this game interesting but this is not for me. ,False,False
"Bonjuur, Steam user! PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS or PUBG, as it is most often called, is a survivalist with elements of action. It is with the elements of action, since the whole gameplay boils down to the fact that -you are flying on an airplane -jumping into a town, settlement, training ground ... -search for weapons, body armor, first aid kits ... something that will help you stay in alive - you died from a dude who found the trunk before you because he was more fortunate than you OR you are that asshole who found the trunk before your opponent, in the last version of events - you just dive and wait until everyone dies or wait for someone to come to you - it will come - if you are still alive, then you rush from the zone that kills you (gradually, each subsequent zone - does more and more damage) -And when the zone is the size of my point, then the action begins (because they are already hiding there is nowhere) -Well, and you add a friend until you are left alone (if you play as a team, then a team, respectively) Now about the pros + For the first 20-30 hours it comes with a bang + Stable online about 1 Lama on average + Unnatural feelings when you play with friend and get TOP 1 OOOOO Teper  minuses ----- NOT OPTIMIZED SHIT ----- NO CODE WORSE THERE IS NO WAY ----- RAW (ALTHOUGH THE GAME IS IN RELEASE, BUT FEELS AS A TRANSITION FROM ALPHA VERSION TO BETA) ----- BUGS - --- PHYSICS OF MACHINES, ESPECIALLY MOTORCYCLES (ONE MOUNT AND A CORPSE) ----- DYNAMICS (AS I WRITTEN, EVERYONE IS CAMPERING) ----- DRAWING (STARTING FROM 100 METERS THE GRASS DOES NOT DRAW) ",False,False

"At first glance a nice game with nice elements. However, there is no catchy storyline and everything is the same from start to finish. Stupid shooting seems like the only goal, but finding hidden rooms and items is challenging! For those who like that and make no further demands, this might be a great game. Since everything is the same, it gets very boring halfway through so I no longer enjoy the gameplay. As a result, you simply sit down and shoot to finish the game as quickly as possible. The gameplay also offers a number of options to improve your performance and skins, but given the monotonous nature of the game and the boredom that it causes, it is not a challenge for me to work on it any longer. In short, for me a game that you play once and then never again. ",False,False

"TL:DR Game is nowhere near worth it's amount and has many problems that should be fixed. I rarely ever write reviews for the games I play whether I enjoy or hate them but given the circumstances for this game in particular, a review is a must. And from what I've played, this game is absolutely garbage. This game is a DEATHMATCH style moba, not a King of the Hill. You fight against 7 other opponents in a battle to the death. You have 4 lives. Last person left standing is the winner. Let's start with the classes. There are four classes in the game at the moment which consists of your generic Knight, Archer, Axeman and Mage. These classes are extremely unbalanced and the Knight class will win in a fight almost every single time. Playing a class such as Archer will only net you kills is if your enemy has noticeably health than you or you're not being directly targeted. You're also given no description of any of the classes, it's abilities, DPS, speed, or anything. All there is to see is the look and name of your character doing a certain animation. I'm not sure if I missed it during the loading times or anything but there seemed to have not been any proper place to select my character other than clicking on them in the profile screen then joining a queue, which forced me to play Archer the whole time whether I wanted to or not. Once you actually get yourself into a match, you'll find how dull the music is and how cheap and repetitive the sound effects are with the only thing keeping me playing is the cluster of people going at it and getting some cheap kills at the knights before dying to one yourself. The majority of the content really is killing others until they run out lives, which isn't bad but isn't really good either. When the match is over, the back to main menu button is temporarily disabled.....HOW DOES THAT MANAGE TO OCCUR??!?  But for all I saw that is bad, there are a few pros being the controls feels really for how it plays although the buttons on the main menu is a bit iffy at times. The animations graphics are also pretty decent except the ones again in the main menu. And these are my opinions on the game I had created when I had started up and played for the first time. Given that I had played and created this review in early access, most of everything wrong here can be changed such as: These are all basic suggestions however and won't create a great game from hopefully fixing these alone. I leave the creativity part up to you guys. ",False,True

"Good day! Xcom 2 is my first experience in this genre. There is nothing to compare it with, so there will be only dry criticism! I'll start with the pros: + Beautiful graphics + Destruction of the environment + Large selection of character customization + Non-linearity of missions + Pumping, both the base and characters with weapons + Plots And now the cons: - The system for calculating damage to the enemy (absolute random) , With a 30% chance of hitting, the character can hit the target and vice versa, with a 70% chance to miss. I'm not even talking about the absurdity when you shoot at point blank range and the character with unnatural animation deflects the sight of the enemy and shoots past. Since this is the main component of gameplay by 70 percent, it becomes unbearable to play at more difficult levels! I do not recommend buying this game for the money it sells. It's a candy wrapper! Its price is 400-500 rubles. not more. If you want to buy, then wait for good discounts! Have a nice game! ",False,False

"The gameplay of this game is nice, you can do some really crazy stuff with it, however, it's very scarce and simple in comparison to the non-reboot games in the series, specially 4 and 5. And the inclusion of a button to dodge just feels...weird with this type of game too. The combo system is a tad broken, as you only need to switch between 1/2 moves apparently before you can repeat the other. And I don't have to mention that the story is horrible, right? Cause it's not news at this point. It's practically your generic trope of protagonist, secretly bad guy but  , terrible sidekick. You can see the story from miles away, specially if you played the original games. It almost feels forced. But at least the final fight is very satisfying(until you have to figure out you need Devil trigger to finish it.) The Vergil's DLC is more acceptable, but Vergil has a moveset that is very small for you to consistently combo without getting your ass capped by an attack. But it's not a surprise, since you only need to use 2 combos to even do a S Rank. ",False,False

"Initially was a positive review... Changed this to reflect latest 20MB patch which now only allows 8 clicks per second when using auto clickers Devs somehow think people don't use auto clickers to play games like this? so my almost 700 hrs game time has been wasted, forced to use money because paywalls have been put in place. No where do devs stipulate you cannot use an auto clicker For an EA game this isn't the smartest thing to do, you've just gone and changed the rules when the game was hard enough as it was Game is ruined now... Totally avoid this game, you're going to spend months getting anywhere or you will be forced to spend real money EDIT so I decided after what I consider a completion of the game, to post my thoughts 1st things 1st, devs do respond to things that are broken, so if things have happened to you in game where money is involved or not, they will personally fix this, I like this and praise the devs for this care and attention: this is where the praise ends unfortunately So the game i have now clocked up 900+ hours and I found while it kept me occupied, there was very little to do that was rewarding. I was an active player so used an auto clicker (I advise to use one and it's not cheating as some suggest), the game stalls for some reason and I don't think the migration from Mobile platform to PC has worked well in favor of devs So you can complete this game without money and what I mean complete is 100% achiements, after that there is no real reason for me to continue It's a lot of time and I personally would not do this ever again, but the timing was right and I had spare time based on certain personal goals being achieved, given I pooled my efforts into this (being a fan of the TV show caught my attention so thought any meme could be a good meme). I soon recognised how much effort was required to get my 100% fulfilment, this was a social experiment gone horribly wrong, things changed in the game that made progression feel retarded, held back So I have already posted how auto clicker was nerfed, that wasn't so much an issue as the events were, which became a distraction of the main task, which is for me 100% achievements So these events, while had some nice extras, really all they do is hold you back from doing what youo're supposed to be doing, and it adds up to 125hrs? to the whole dynamic, and yes it's become weekly I don't like how the game has changed so rapidly like things have just been added to please the few paying customers? I don't know and I am not accusing, but asking a question, it just feels that a minority here is being catered for, ie the paying player that can and will get what they pay for, which is obviously an advantage, it doesn't mean non paying players are at a disadvantage, it means that that aspect of the game is being neglected The game is designed to create revenue, cash cows it needs to move to fiscal targets to be succesful Most players (this is an opinion) do not spend money so the driving force of this game, you guessed it is money Devs can do what they want, as long as there is a way of 100% achievements without money, I am all good for that, what doesn't gell well is when devs change the focus of the game mid way, or early on and these changes affect in my eyes the monetary value of the game I will explain, certain things early on which people spent money on changed to where newer players could potentially have to spend more money on or less, given the dynamics have changed Not good Also the fact of the matter that these things should have been worked out in EA, not full release which makes spending money in this game a bit of a gamble, to which my last point's measure This game with money becomes a bit of a gamble as you really do not know what you're getting when you buy the packs, there is not enough consistancy as you cannot sell anything you acquire, other than the cards you get (this is the bonus), but one player might spend more money achieving the same results as another, to me which is too random /TL:DR oh well, such is life... __________________________________________________________________________ I will leave everything here, BUT add that the devs actually do care about their community If I could leave a nuetral review, I would, but alas I cannot There has been some toxic behaviour in threads which devs have stated that using an auto clicker is NOT against ToS The devs are right in posting this and posted due to concerns of the players that use an auto clicker...

And in vain. In the RD there is something in the area of the content prototype. Namely, 3 enemies, and each of them has 3 almost identical levels of Bullet Hell, 1 pose-art (in 4 variations differing in the degree of dress), 1 terrible Live2D animation in 3 speeds.

"First things first, Unity 3D. Who thought this was going to on the Unity 3D engine? Anyone? Nope. Why is it on the Unity 3D engine? Who knows. Whoever made that decision is the reason why this game has such horrific reviews. The animations, Frame Rates and over all clunky feeling the ENTIRE game has is most likely due to the engine being Unity 3D. Watch as you get a solid maybe 70 frames, then your sensitivity will skyrocket as your FPS dips to like 20 and it picks it back up. I ran this game in 1440p, on the lowest settings with a 2080TI and the entire time the game is open your GPU will be hard stuck at 99% usage the entire time this game is open.  Thats the Unity 3D engine for ya. Second stop on this ride is the Animations. A disaster in itself. NONE of the animations I saw ran smoothly/correctly. Many times your gun (Especially the magnum) will clip back to the last frame of the shooting animation, so it just jitters back and forth sometimes. The enemy movement is choppy, and whenever you kill anyone they all to the SAME EXACT death animation every single time. Think of a T pose, but with them holding a finger pistol and then just toppling over. On every single enemy. Completely ruins the immersion every time you kill someone. In a nutshell this is how animations are -   : 3 minutes of just WTF. Basically in the entire game Graphical wise - I didn't see many issues. It looked good when standing still, hence why the screenshots make the game look amazing on the store page.  AI in this game is also just a mess. I played on the second to last hardest difficulty. So basically hard, and in-between trying to aim correctly with the   and messed up animation you can basically just click once on their head and their dead. I barely ever even checked my health unless I was getting sniped, without the snipers and bazookas the damage input to you is next to nothing. I played up until the mission where you go into the tent to bug the guys office. No matter what I did, I always failed the mission as soon as I planted the bug. I hid bodies, did everything but as soon as the guy spawns in it was game over. After 2 tries at that, I gave up and started writing the review. In a nutshell, I do not see many of these issues getting fixed with the current engine and I do not ever see this game going above ""Mixed"" reviews on steam. Why they thought this was ready to roll out as a completed game is beyond me and is now on my list for THE worst remake I have ever played. For a full playthrough of what I painstakingly went through, you can watch the stream and click anywhere in the video to see this game in its full, depressing glory. By about minute 10 I realized I was in for a treat, and now cannot refund due to steams 2 hours rule.  My playthrough -  Some dumb lookin deer that just stood there and did nothing, but I remember it being in the original with animations. Just a derp deer - ",False,False
"First things first: What is XIII? A stylish and compelling FPS. While it doesn't exactly make any enourmous improvements to the genre, the story element is strong and the comic - style gameplay is truly enjoyable, even today! Multiplayer is another string to this games bow but hardly cutted. Overall this is a slick, enjoyable game so far (ONLY STORY WISE) - well worth owning and the multiplayer will hold your interest for ages. You are the victim of a conspiracy! Find your way out and uncover the mysterys behind the assassination of the President of the United States, William Sheridan. His death is a nod similar to real-life former President John F. Kennedy who was killed by a sniper bullet to the head in Dallas in 1963. The downside so far: No Bots and only two game Modes (Deathmatch and Team-Deathmatch), while the Original had way more. Plus the Maps are also cutted. A huge let-down in regards to the Multiplayer - but still enjoyable if you're looking for Singleplayer... but thats no the only con sadly... The biggest let-down: Multiplayer is not working as of now. You can select a Character but not go ingame LOL!!! This is a stylish and fun game that sadly did not get the recognition it deserved. Too many reviews gave it a thumbs down because it ""wasn't as good as Halo."" back in the days... Well, it wasn't trying to be Halo. Very well written, XIII has a compelling story that will keep you interested and guessing all the up until the cliffhanger ending. The music is superb, the voice acting is good, the cell-shaded graphics are very cool, and it is a very fun game to play. Some folks may not like that you can't save anywhere and that it builds up on ""checkpoints"" which are not that well placed. but that is sort of par for the course for Ubisoft of that time period. I highly recommend it. After all the games I've played so far, this is still one I think of fondly and plan to play again. Plus there are grappling hooks! The Downside: It also has some bugs (Not gamebreaking ones) in the Campaign. - Aiming is reaaaally slow while holding right click (You can watch around pretty smoothly but aiming is just slower settings-wise). Problem is: You can't change that (Not as far as I'm aware of) - Sounds are copy and pasted from the original (To keep the feeling in a newer and fresher look) and I like that! I dont need new voice actors because you know it as much as I do. As soon as your lovely series / show gets a new voice actor you immediately recognize it and don't like the show anymore. XIII Doesn't have that problem - There are a few frame-rate issues especially in the Bank Level. - No Ultrawide Support (4k etc.) - After the flashback on the beach, when it took me back to the beach from the boat I was greeted to the lifeguard having no pupils for half a second before her eyes rolled back onto their spot. - High Temps and might be unoptimized (You can see the typical outrage in the forums already) The last point is why I'm giving it a thumbs down. I play at 144hz @1440p and it should not be possible to overheat a 2080Ti with a Game like this while I Play everything else with 40-50 Degrees. There are also collectables (golden statues) to find all around the Level and it gives you extra content to find. It overall looks pretty good. Just do us all a favor: ",False,False

"Yeah, my playtime is low but there's a number of reasons for that, including dropping Windows 7 support requiring some jiggering to play it and simply not being interested in what the game has become. I purchased this game based on the product that it was... 6 yearss ago, and the roadmap supplied that continued it down an action rpg road that I really liked the look of, and I really enjoyed the alpha, then I shelved it since I expected updates to come and I didn't want to burn out... and then nothing happened, for years. Cut to January of this year and the developer put out another little bit of information as he had come to do every 6-12 months and the game was still moving towards what the roadmap outlined. Again cut ahead a few months and you land with the announcement of the game actually being released and I was excited, then I looked deeper and found that the game had had nearly every feature stripped from it to a barebones quasi-rpg with no true progression, no procedural worlds, no skill trees and on and on. I was unimpressed, and so was most of the community surrounding it. I'm not going to make this about the politics of what happened then but I will say that this was a game I liked, and now it is not and I cannot recommend it. You can find plenty of information on what happened and what changed elsewhere and have no doubt seen it already if you're read this far.

Second major problem is -teaming- among ""The killer and the counselors"" is unpreventable and most likely to happen since the players still not considerate enough to be fair/decent to everyone, which actually leads to my third point about their excessively toxic and disproportionate way of communication and behavior that frustrate many and ruin their gaming experience.

"I understand that the ""Adult Only"" Can give out quit a 'shock' to most audiences, making some people (like me) more interested in playing it.

And yeah, the sex scenes are even more bland (I don't want to lie and say that i wasn't interested in the game because of them as-well).. But its basically just clicking and hitting a white part of a circle type-of-minigame, and said minigame helps you progress in the game by teleporting you to the other weird dimension where you have to do even MORE go-fetch puzzles. The plot is interesting but really damn weak and unrealistic, at the beginning of the demo my attention was caught due to the somewhat unique atmosphere..But my enthusiasm quickly dissipated once i noticed the chores the player has to follow and the bad level design that pushes you to walking over and over and over again around the theatre without anything interesting happening except 2 bland jumpscares The combat system is buggy and sometimes hits dont sync.  The optimization of the game is unexistent and lazy. I was expecting more than a puzzle fetch game, i understand this is a demo but i'll be honest -- If the real game is going to be like this, then i'm not interested. Despite my annoyance i completed all the puzzles and well, the voice acting in the secret room once you hear the recording was pretty good and alluring to the story, so i'll give you that.

"When evaluating games like Dota, it is worth considering this old recipe for creating a collective monotonous shit: 1. Come up with 5-10 YOBA characters. 2. Coming up with 30- shitty bastards that kill each other with two hits. 3. Coming up with 30-100 supposedly different items that supposedly improve the 30- shitty bugs, but in reality we add them only for greater imbalance. 4. Coming up with FANTASTIC DESCRIPTIONS FOR FUNNING OBJECTS FOR IMBALANCE, and you need to vyserat them as carefully as possible so that this description is read 0-2 times and not for all subjects. 5. Coming up with an INCREDIBLY variety of NPCs with very good advanced AI, thanks to which they will be able to chase you as much as 2 (!) meters from their collection point. 6. Draw DOCHERS of beautiful, varied cards, thanks to which players will feel some freshness of the game, and put them all in one little pile of shit, giving as much as 0.0000000000001% variety per hour. 7. Draw some pretty good textures. 8. We put them so that all objects are spread out on the screen, or so that all the characters suddenly become skinheads. 9. We put several servers. 10. PR. 11. PR. 12. We make the game free because of no demand. 13. PR. 14. PR. 15. Introduce hats / skins into the game. 16. ... 17. PROFIT! You can use the 2004 engine if you want.

"I am so disappointed with the developers of Undead Souls. I'd had this title on my wishlist for a while now, so when I saw it at 90% off the $9.99 price tag today, I didn't even hesitate. Apparently, I should have. Now, it's important to note that I hadn't read anything about asset flips or the poor reviews from Gun Brothers and Massive, so I really went into this blind and optimistic. I love a well-done roguelike, and top-down twinstick shooters are my jam, so I was expecting one thing but got something else entirely.  My major gripe with Undead Souls is that it's completely unplayable. I found the controls to be unresponsive with a notable delay between button presses and action. However, the swarming opponents have no such delay in their activity and made short work of my 7 hit points, usually before I'd even realized that I'd been hit with something. To say that opponents are seriously overpowered under the circumstances would be a tragic understatement.  The starting angel character fights with a sword, but the player still utilizes twinstick combat to aim in the direction of the swing. Unfortunately, hitboxes seem to be out of whack, because try as I might, I only connected about half the time. I stuck it out long enough to unlock the jester character, thinking that maybe a projectile weapon would even the odds a bit, but it did no such thing. Graphics and sound didn't even rate as mediocre. In fact, while I was playing, or attempting to play, those weren't even tracking for me. I had to go back in and pay close attention to even determine that they weren't worth my time because I was so overwhelmed and frustrated trying to get the mechanics to work. I was able to alter the zoom and disable screen shake, but that made little to no difference in gameplay for me. Under no circumstances can I recommend this game, not even at the 99 cent price I paid today. In fact, I'm submitting my refund request to Valve for this unplayable game the very second that I publish my review. With titles like Nuclear Throne, Enter the Gungeon, Streets of Rogue, Gatling Gears, Crimson, Feral Fury, NeuroVoider, Zombie Party, Hero Siege, Kill to Collect, Android Cactus, Utopia 9, Necropolis, Crypt of the NecroDancer, Dead Cells, and Full Mojo Rampage, you're sure to find a worthy roguelike or twin-stick shooter for your library.

"Cleaner or how we use a bow to genocide emotional waste. The game has funny music, the backdrops are ordinary Jpeg from Google, everything is extremely simple, but there is one thing that at least does not give me a positive assessment of this game. We shoot from a bow and it is the control that is done badly. To understand this, you need to try it yourself. In words this is so, you pull the bow with the mouse and after that it becomes inconvenient to aim because the slightest movement to the side and already the tension weakens and from that, you always have to bring forward to the maximum. In my opinion, the game turned out to be controversial and maybe the problem is only with me with the control itself, but an unpleasant aftertaste remains.

"I have never had so much negativity for any project ... Several years of early access (three or even four?) And the game has not surpassed its predecessor in any aspect. It seems that the second part was done by completely different people, while suffering from all possible mental disorders combined. As a result, if we compare with the original (yes, with the original, since this game is nothing else but a fake), what we have is: - Degraded mechanics. All mods are simplified or spoiled, half are removed. The game component has simply lost its relevance in this part. - Awful visual component. The game was made obviously for a blunder, without resorting to the services of professional designers or at least people who do not suffer from color blindness and lack of taste. It is simply unrealistic to achieve a beautiful picture here. Even modifications won't help. The engine itself is so poor that the picture can no longer be saved. I spent two hours trying to find an adequate skin for my favorite song. - Color settings R.I.P. Mods and skins replaced this great function, which, with the proper skills, could turn any composition into a color work of art. For several years of existence of the AS2 workshop, not a single adequate skin has been released. All of them are either vomit-acid, or pale-worthless. Well, fuck it, I didn't like the skins made by other people, I'll do it myself! Yeah ... Even googol and knowledge of English won't help here. I will not even describe how poor the process of creating modifications is. - Komunity R.I.P. All of the above just killed the social component of the game. Integration into Steam also did not help. The first part is still played by a lot more people, and besides, it is free. In the second part, you will not be able to launch anything from the classic British prog-rock of the 80s or Neo-progressive jazz (Something not popular and rare now) and after the end of the race you will see hundreds of other like-minded people who are repulsed from society. No. You can't find this here. Let me remind you that the first part was released in 2008, is completely free (f2p was always distributed outside of Steam) and is absolutely gorgeous. There is simply no point in playing this brainchild of developers' greed and laziness. P.s. Grammar and punctuation are in decline as at the time of this writing, I have 5 in the morning and I was tormented all night with attempts to relax to my favorite music. ",False,False
"The game is terribly optimized, the graphics in it, because of the shadows and the curve of Depth of Field, look worse than in Fallout 4 (and the water there is just a quiet horror), and the bugs that 76 was so famous for on release are nowhere have gone - I myself, having played only 30-odd hours at the time of writing the first version of this review, have already managed to see enough of wildly blunt enemies (and their corpses disappearing along with the loot), hard laying and receiving damage from nowhere, and once , having entered the game, and ended up in a completely different place from which it left, and even with a couple of changes in the inventory. In addition to all of the above, you can recall that this game, in essence, is aimed at cooperation with other players - only there is no point in interacting with them - except, perhaps, buying things at less extortionate rates than from game merchants, yes to help with daily operations and events, reminders of which pop up on the screen every three minutes when you least expect it - for example, right in battle. By the way, about the local combat ... It is much less dynamic than in the previous three-dimensional games of the series - due to the disgusting network code and very strange damage calculation - and it doesn't bode well for very big rewards. In fact, you will be lucky if you manage not to lose ammunition, but just to knock out of the enemy not just a legendary, but at the same time useful, item is an extremely non-trivial matter (and the option of exchanging legendary items with a unique NPC is also subordinate terrible random, in addition being very limited in ""bandwidth"" of this merchant). As for the plot and lore: oddly enough, I still liked some moments in them, and some characters (for example, it is here that one of the two hides in the entire series of normal Overseers) would even be able to evoke a certain degree of sympathy - if they weren't just voices on holotapes and, with luck, rotting remains. However, after going through the quest lines (extremely monotonous, by the way, in terms of gameplay) as many as two partners who were brought into the game with the release of Wastelanders, I can say that this is probably for the best, because the game simply does not know how to handle with live NPCs - and the bugs that relate specifically to them are so absurd that they completely discourage the desire to touch the main part of the add-on, where living people (who can forget who you are \ decompose into several copies of themselves \ on the go alter the made you in the dialogue choice) promises even more. One way or another, I won't be able to touch upon a fairy tale about some unknown Settlers and Raiders - after all, I want to explore the game world not just anyhow, but in a certain sequence, but the plot dedicated to getting rid of the Burning Ones cannot be closed even with a partner ( or to be more precise, a horde of endlessly spawning robots, from which you need to protect several of their absolutely helpless (and, it seems to me, also bugged) brothers at the very end of a rather long dungeon, stupidly destroyed all our stocks of ammunition and medicines, pouring all the progress into the toilet ) - despite the fact that we have accumulated good arsenals and both managed to raise the 60th level. And this is after the developers' statements that Fallout 76 is just a kind of experiment of the company, and you can absolutely play it alone. In general, the scriptwriters of the game still want to declare verbal encouragement, and game designers and programmers can go fuck their ass. In the end, the situation we have is as follows: if you are thinking of buying Fallout 76, seduced by the views of Appalachia (at least, Bethesda never had any problems with creating beautiful worlds), but you see how a person who went to ALL 3D parts of Fallout ( except for the console BOS), it discourages you from this in every possible way, then think about it - maybe this is just the case when you should regret your time and money?

"Foundation is the perfect title for the game, why? Because it literally has a good foundation but everything is very early access; It has the makings of being a good city builder sim like the others in the genre, however in it's VERY early access state it's a no from me. Like with most of these city builder sims you get to run your very own village, build up, and survive against hostile threats or the elements whether it be the weather kind or the sickness/virus kind; There is no tutorial level of any kind, only tutorial objectives at the beginning of every 'build' scenario, be very aware the river map (riverside or whatever it's called) is extremely broken or rather poorly implemented, that map forces you to essentially stick to land for most of the build before you even think of building your very cool riverside city. You do get rewards from completing objectives which is nice (kinda of). The biggest turn-off though will be the $30 pricetag for an early access. It's more of a $20 to me or lower, because of how much the game needs work, which btw the developers are listening and responding, etc. Look elsewhere for city builder sims, avoid this one for now until better systems, and better things are add in general.

There is no currency or anything you can buy or story mode so there isnt even motivation to play the game. When you hit a wall the cars is getting destroyed so weirdly and bad. The Looking around is so weird sometimes it even glitches out (almost always) you cant even look around. The main thing i hate about the game its a huge asset flip That everyone can buy and publish it..:  The good thing that i coud actually see taht there were 10  cars that looked insane but compared to their looks they were driving so freaking slow! There were also alot of maps that you coud play on... even tho they were badly made.. - You can customize cars. - Has alot of tracks. - Has Trading Cards. - There are many fps drops - AI isnt very good... saying it nicely.. - Needs way more optimisation - Car damage system Just makes litterally no sense how they break so suddenly it needs way more improvement  - Alot of bugs and glitches but its typical  for Early acces games. - No Steam Achievements. - Its Asset Flip - NO story or anything why woud you want to keep playing - No currency that you coud buy stuff with Rating 3/10 Good thing its still in Early access and there is still hope that it can improve... ,False,True

"First of all, the game is extremely short. It took me about 2 hours to finish and the room was because I died so many times and in most places I didn't understand where to go. Guns feel ridiculous. The feeling is almost nonexistent. The sections are very well done. It has a place as far as Black Mesa. I looked around for most of the episodes, they designed it very well. The modeling is bad, the game doesn't have its own voiceover. Some monsters hit too much. But the worst part of this game is its bugs. It doesn't take 10 minutes before seeing a bug in the game. SECOND I started the game, there was a bug, the crosshair was left in the upper left corner and the UI was not visible. If you are going to play, play if you are a HEAVY Half-Life fan.

"It looks like I played the game for 4 hours because of Idle Master. Not realizing that the vast majority of reviews were bad, I wanted to install the game, installed it, started playing. I think the producer company designed the game as a mobile game; With graphics, gameplay, artificial intelligence, aim system and even intermediate scene transitions, the loading screen looks like it was officially designed for smartphones with a 4.5 inch screen. While I was reviewing the game, the mechanics of Gameloft's Mortal Combat (the name was like this, I can't remember exactly) kept coming to my mind. I looked at the game for 15 minutes, the game told me to aim with the crossbow and kill the enemy. I took aim and left click and the man stopped as he was. After 1-2 seconds he ""fainted"" and fell to the ground. I definitely don't understand why you wanted to wait so long ... How is the story, I have no idea.

"Yeah, not going to recommend this. Cool idea, implemented poorly.  First the neutral:  Basic Unity assets (which is fine by me, not that much of a graphics snob) and unobtrusive background music (which can be turned off.) Now the Bad:  For a physics game, there's no feeling of weight, friction, momentum, anything really. It feels slippery, like I'm sliding all over the place. Movement is WASD, turning and shooting is with the mouse. There's no sound or anything to alert you where the enemies are, so you must keep a constant AND speedy lookout... however, even with mouse sensitivity up to 150, turning to guard your sides / back was garbage.  After getting hit 4 times, you die.  I am not good at FPS and I KNOW this, but I CAN tell the difference between a good shooter and a crappy one.   Furthermore, just to check myself: I asked a friend (good with FPS games) and my youngest (very good with FPS) to play the game and they both had the same complaint regarding the controls as I did.

The game is not only very technical, but your equipment configuration is also important. Dont you think thats the only thing in the game.

There's no rank system, so you are pitched against these players on your first match, so good luck getting better when these people have had thousands of hours to practice and improve their skills.

You can blame external factors for its inevitable demise for a while, but eventually you will have to admit that the problem lies with the game itself.

"This game was, quite Frankly, a disappointment for me and many others. Having played TNO and TOB I couldn't help but feel I was playing an inferior version of the first game. Personal feelings aside though, here's the review: You play as William J. Blazkowicz (BJ), the protagonist of pretty much every Wolfenstein game. The game starts with BJ waking up from a coma. Nazis are invading Eva's Hammer (Captured by the resistance, now used as HQ). The story of the game is good. Not as good as TNO but still better than TOB.  The first problem appears in the first level of the game: The difficulty. Now, I'm a sucker for hard games, but The New Colossus is just a weird cookie. The game makes you feel like a badass, but try to stand still in a battle for two seconds and you're dead. It's not the type of hard that incentivises you to get better to do better, it's all just based on luck. The action in this game is completely dumbed down because of this. You'll either hide and hope you find a medkit or armor (that will get devoured by bullets in seconds) or restart the level to try a different approach. Here we get to the second giant issue I have with the game. TNO and TOB had two different ways of completing a mission. You could either go doomguy style and kill everything in your way but lose a ton of health or you could go for a silent way by stealth killing enemies without them knowing what hit them thus preserving health and armor for the next level. This diversified style of play brought in so much more replay value to the game. You simply can't do that in Wolfenstein 2. Trying to play stealthily in a level designed for reckless play? Good luck finding a place to hide! Trying to play recklesly in a level designed for stealth? You'll get shot down in seconds! It really eliminates the will to play the game again, knowing that you'll have to play the same way again This leads us to the last problem I have with the game: The level design. It is simply HORRID. There's this part in New Orleans: You are heading down a dim alley. You see two paths: The one to the left is lit up and has enemies coming out of it, while the one to the right is dark and unlit. Which path do you think is the right one? This is not good level design, and it's not the only level. You will lose just so much time wondering where you have to go. Time that could have been spent on killing nazis. As for the weapons, they are ok, not the most interesting but they do reflect the time this game takes place in. Even though some look like they were made in the Age of Steam, while others look really futuristic. The enemies I like. They are varied and interesting, from normal humans all the way to robot dogs breathing fire. Too bad Steam doesn't have a neutral review type. That is what I would give this game. It's not bad per se but compared to the last games, it's definitely inferior. Edit: Minor typos ",False,False
"If you suffer for a long time, something will work out ... Unfortunately, this only happens in anime, and in real life, efforts alone are often not enough. Indeed, the developers clearly tried, but the game came out frankly weak. Cons: - The size of the game. Obviously, in (it seems to me so) 20-25k words on the root do not fit any acquaintance with the characters, nor their disclosure, nor conflicts, nor the culmination. Everything looks very messy and crumpled. Timeskips for two months are generally a cannon! Perhaps it was worth choosing a slightly different plot structure instead of the classic novel. - Script. Almost everything is bad. The beginning seemed to be written by a man who with all his heart hates this business, but he was forced under torture. Further rue. Yui - they talked something, kittens, bullies, rain, the end ... What did I read, why did I read this? It just doesn't. Chinatsu is the only ray of light in this entire dark kingdom. But here it is not without fail: practically from the first lines, the main root confict becomes clear (at least to me). It's written quite well, the scriptwriter of this root knows his business, but reading a detective novel, knowing from the very beginning who the killer is, is that ... Even the final scene - albeit quite suitable - does not give the root a positive assessment. Megumi. Theater of the absurd, the benefit of autism! I haven't read such nonsense for a long time. 0/10. Shiro. Sluggishly. I just want to exclaim - I don't believe it! The point here is not even in realism, but in the general impression - everyone behaves completely differently from the way they should by the IRL or even in the anime. - Art. It's trite little. I won't talk about backgrounds - you can see them on the screenshots. Each sprite received just one miserable pose and a miserable pair of emotions. This stinginess looks especially ridiculous in Shiro's route. Moreover, many characters who have a lot of screen time allotted no sprites at all! TGs are generally mediocre, and they are also not enough. - Music. Too bad. Although the tracks are as background as possible, they are not only not remembered, but sometimes even annoying. I will note only 1.5 tracks from Chinatsu's root (especially in the epilogue). Pros: - A certain general idea, concept is visible, in some places - work on the setting, notes on the tops of the general synopsis. - Basically, the interesting characters of Yui and Shiro. Although it would be a stretch to talk about it, because they are not corny. - Not a bad Chinatsu root. However, it is heavily blurred by the evidence of the conflict. Total: Considering everything, the game is more attractive to the demo version; IMHO, in this form to sell it in Steam is a shame. Is it possible to improve so that everything becomes as it should be? Of course! But you will have to spend 5 more times for the same amount of time as was already spent on development. ",False,False

Your production is like never enough for what you consume regularly and you cant research or provide the essentials needs before the winter. About the invasions; it's happening so often you keep losing health and before recovering your folks, some other s...storm popping up. Needs more mechanics like being able to control your population's actions, free roaming -not stationary- security job assignments from the beginning and maybe grouping the security teams with some hotkeys, being able to occupy or deconstruct the existing buildings in the map -cuz hey! why I wanna build a house when there are a lot of em around- Needs a better AI -as many other already mentioned your workers just walking around the danger and waiting to be killed- Bigger maps with extended borders so we can actually pan around and see the inside of the buildings scattered around the edges.

"Okay so if you dont want to read the full review here is a sum up: decent but short story. Large area to explore but it feels empty, decent items added but not many of them. Characters are good, well voiced and add to the island/ harbor theme a lot.  : The characters are well voiced and unique compared to the commonwealth NPC's. The rewards in the story are well done and appropriate for the setting and many of the new items are well done aswell, including the uniques legendary weapons and armors you can buy. The island itself is a good atmospheric setting with you having to always worry about rad damage and a fog crawler crawling up on you, the DLC places a lot of emphasis on how dangerous the island is. The children of atom were also well done. : reading what I wrote above you may be wondering why I didnt give a thumb up.............. This is because while all these things are good they are all overshadowed by how empty the world and main quest line feels. The main story line is basically one quest line that gives you the option of which faction to chose at the end regardless of how you have interacted with them( you can do all far harbor mics quests and have done none for the Children of Atom and yet you can side with the children in the end), its as if the choices we make are invalid and the quest is chummed up into one single decision. While the island itself is large and takes some time to explore if you are just walking around it just feels empty with few interesting locations outside the ones used for the main quest. There are five new enemies added of which two are basically from the base game but with new names(trappers=raiders, wolves= rabid/attack dogs), this means that wile there are three new enemies they get boring after 3 or so hours. Its not at all work the price tag( i bought it after look at some screen shots and watching some videos and it looked good), i was extremely disappointed by the sheer lack of content like they sort of slapped it together and added a decent sized price tag. I recommend waiting for a sale or just not buying it. With that money i could have bought two or even three decent games full of content.

"An interesting game, as the first in the series, you play as a Templar here (yes, in the trio it was played for Haytham for a while, but it was only for a while at the beginning). The main protagonist Shay is an average character. Despite the big bomb of Unity, the game managed to gain a certain place among the other Assassins. This game has, but a terrible minus in that in terms of gameplay it is (except for about two things) an identical game as Black Flag and releasing it as a new game does not sound very good to me - they could only give it as a paid data disc (see Witcher 3 and Blood and Wine) to four or at least not want so much money for it. Buy this game for the story of this game, or if you liked AC: 4 and would like to repeat it. In short, don't expect anything (except the story) for anything new or interesting. Verbal summary of the game: Slight above average Pros: + A story that is great, you understand Shay why he does what he does, there are a few twists in it + Originality - for the first time the main character is Templar Cons: - Very, very little news (I remember perhaps the only new mechanics and that was jumping assassins out of hiding in an attempt to kill me, which I'm not sure if it was annoying or interesting, and therefore I do not give it as a plus or a minus) - Things that the game presents as new (air rifle what arrows or grenade launchers shoot) are practically the same as, for example, AC4 rifle blowers or grenades repackaged in a new coat - Only one new slightly interesting location (North Atlantic) - The only relationship to the supporting characters I had to assassins, which is wrong both factions and the Templars was only ONE normal / positive, which would not really change my view of them.

": early access  good. I will tell you right away where so many positive reviews come from - for me it remains a mystery. You can play something, but is it possible to get pleasure from it? Let's figure it out. The main thing to note is early access, which, to put it mildly, spoils the impression of the game - here you can safely write down lags, unsuccessful / unfinished combat, ugly graphics, not always successful soundtrack, lack of tolerable physics, damage that does not immediately break through ... meets us with a rather typical fantasy role-playing environment - some lost islands, the main character, a shipwreck who needs to assemble his team ... And it seems, not bad, but in this world there is still no motivation to study: for example, you can see something in the distance- then luminous - perhaps this is a hint of some kind of chest or at least beautiful crystals, as in the third Gothic (yes, sometimes even to gaze at a beautiful entourage is already a good motivation). But no, it's just some kind of bug that appears from time to time on various planes. It would seem that the situation could be corrected by a simple collection of resources, as it is well played in various cooperative survival games: from to, where crafting is interesting and understandable, and the discovery and extraction of new resources are not associated with great difficulties - the game itself will tell you what is needed to collect them ... Here, new resources are simply highlighted .. and that's it. You can't take them somehow, you can just look in their direction with a sad smile on your lips and move on. Of course, among these shortcomings, you can see the beginnings of an interesting RPG with thoughtful dialogues and a beautiful world, even if the graphics are far from perfect. Not a bad hacking mechanic - something similar happened in, if my memory serves me right. Translation into Russian is not expected yet, but it may be possible to wait for it thanks to the possibility of modifications from the community. It's too early to sponsor developers and hope for a high-quality final product: everything looks like a good half of the indies in Early Access, and not finished. However, there is a lot to learn here with the right enthusiasm. I will be glad if the developers bring their creation to the end and take into account all the shortcomings, but so far this game is difficult to recommend for passing. : + pleasant ambient music; + dialogues promise to be interesting. : - curve physics; - general dampness of the product; - one of the saddest battles I've played; - even at low graphics settings freezes. : Skyrim this game will not replace, but, in theory, can transform into a pretty good representative of the genre.

"Armed with a water-gun inside a dance / stripclub, the goal in Wet Girls is to entirely soak the dancers clothes. Within a given time, without running out of ammunition and successfully evading the security guards. Gameplay and controls are rudimentary, moving around is done by the classic WASD keys. There are the options to pan the camera left or right and to zoom in and out. Some skill and patience are required to move to the exact spots. Squirting is done by mouse look and LMB.  There is the option to rebind keys, through the Input Tab page on the configuration dialogue before the game starts*. Although the Steam store displays the nudity & sexual content tags for this game, there is little that shows of these when playing. Clothing merely gets a bit of transparent, but thats about it. Only the free DLC shows sexual content. The dancers move in a very fluent, smooth and natural way, however, an enjoyable feature. Every stage / girl has her own specific dance style and moves, music accordingly. As you progress through the levels, difficulty mildly picks up with each girl. At one point, a security guard is on the lookout and the player has to be careful not to squirt when the guard is paying attention. Simply implemented by adding a timer on top of his head. With another timer to keep in mind, this is a very annoying feature, it slows down gameplay for no obvious reason, simply adding frustration to an already obnoxious game. Somewhat halfway in the game, a freehand mode gets unlocked, would have been nice if there would have been something to freehand To conclude: during gameplay, I myself never got into a flow or got immersed somehow. It felt a chore to complete the game and unlock its achievements. Developer definitively could / should have done more with this rather unique concept, a shame. Too short, too little gameplay, too little nudity made me recommend against this title. Bought this at a 50% discount to unlock another perfect game through its achievements.

"I bought this game because I am a fan of Kill la Kill and arc system works, that being said this game had big expectations, but when I played it, it left me with mixed feelings, so let's go over the pros and cons - The game really captured the style of kill la kill, from the anime shading, to the lighting to the exaggerated poses and angles, it really stays true to the original work - This game is really mechanically sound, it is simple enough to play casually, yet has enough depth to fill the needs of any competitive player - the roster is really varied, literally no character uses the same fighting style, even the same characters when changing their weapons fight completely different I haven't played online, but from what I've heard in forums and comments, the net code is pretty good, even playing with players from the other side of the world feels fluid - There are several game crashing bugs, and   of annoying bugs, like the characters shadows messing up and showing as horizontal stripes, the hud being illegible, and the screen going completely black. it seems as if it wasn't optimized for PC at all - There is, for some reason, a prohibition to stream or upload any videos containing story, in-depth analysis, or most game modes apart from versus, I understand why they'd choose to censor the story so that it doesn't get spoiled, but the other two? it's just weird they'd shoot themselves in the foot like that, that is basically how a competitive scene starts to grow - While the roster is varied, every fighter has a gimmick, and they have to stick to that gimmick, which in turn limits play style to that specific fighter. - The stages seem like there was very little effort put into them, they're just...plain - The story mode seems a bit draggy, you get several minutes of exposition dialogue cutscenes, whith a few fights in between. I liked the ending of Ryoko, though. - The other game modes are good, but don't seem very polished, specially the ""covers"" mode, that puts you against a lot of covers enemies, it's basically the equivalent of muliman smash in smash bros., the thing is, you can't lock into a single enemy, and oftyen you'll end up attacking the wrong covers just because it was closer to you - customization is really bad, there is only 3 colors, with one being a black and green mess, though this is something minor. in short, the game has potential, but if they don't fix these issues fast, this game is gonna die faster than you can say SEN I SOSHITSU ",False,False

"Being beaten up quickly is completely disgusting. Action games originally emphasized the continuation of moves, dodge between various enemies, and a series of moves to consider corresponding countermeasures. As a result, I had to press the button quickly in QTE. It's all the damn learning from the famous Takahashi. Eat shit, go platinum, I still feel bad about my handle. Oh shit! Hideki Kamiya, set against human operation, the shooting game can be left stick (aiming) + X (shooting)! Have you ever played a shooting game on the host platform? Right stick (aiming) + RT is standard configuration, okay! And it's really arrogant and mentally retarded to not set the keys! Are talented producers so shameless that they are so self-righteous? Or is it just him? I can't say anything if I want to design it this way, but if I can't even change it, it's too much to take players from other districts seriously. It is hard to imagine that this is Japan with careful workmanship. It seems that the decline of Japanese games is also in the ant colony. The last boss is purely disgusting, and the various re-use stages of fighting are really forgotten, and the moves that are hit by a second are not prompted at all. I think its a self-righteous malicious to the players. Its just that I feel good. There is no difficulty curve, and the death is sudden. It deserves the divestment of the SEGA sequel. If I see such a self-satisfied production team, I will probably run away. . The biggest idiot is that choosing a new difficulty will overwrite the old difficulty archive! Yes, you read that right, except for the useless set/model/ost that you typed in extra, all the weapon moves you typed in normal difficulty are gone! I really took it! In this way, I dont even have the motivation to study. Its unheard of not to inherit at all in Er Zhoumu. You are the producer of the originator of Devil May Cry! Everyone in Devil May Cry knows to separate the difficulty archives, you just overwrite the archives! What is the point of asking people to play a week? The only thing that is amazing is the various protagonist moves and appearance and weapon settings. After reading the setting drafts, the professional setting drafts of clothing design with various marker pens feel that they are actually quite aesthetic. Not bad, even today, 7 years later, it looks very fashionable. Cinematic's performance is also very powerful. The seiyuu's performance is also very individual, sexy, charming, and full of temperament. Too stupid, spending half the price can be regarded as fulfilling the idea of not having a host in the past, but I should not delve into this game anymore. It was a conclusion to the memories and longings of the year, and then went on. Platinums holster-changing action games over the years have finally consumed almost its reputation, TMNT, Transformers, etc., and Microsofts divestment of scalebound (hehe scared away an investment publisher). The second generation of the action Tenzun Capcom is really no one in the action design and cinematic interpretation. But I was brainwashed by MGSRR's OST and Shinkawa Yoji's setting and Kojima Supervisor's daimyo? This is not the platinum I know, is it? This is a good thing. Let it die and live. If you die like this, then it can be considered as a monument for the latecomers to persuade the world to persuade you. I believe that I am not because of the grievance of hand-mutilation. If you still think so after reading this, I feel sorry. Apart from hoping that all platinum games on all models are platinum, I can't think of any other blessings. ",False,False

"Unfortunatly, I have to give this game a bad review probably 5.5 / 10 (for now atleast). It is a good game and I love it to death, for 60 dollars though I cant say it was worth the money. It has some pretty big problems that make the game un enjoyable, atleast to me. Remeber to take this as my opinion and nothing else. First I'll start with one of the biggest things like I notice. Lack of customization. From the creators of Planet coaster, I expected more customization in the area of park design. These are a few of the things I've noticed in the customization area.    Number 1. Considering these guys made planet coaster, which has loads of customization, this game is sorely lacking in that area. We only have a basic set of buildings, that, while I do enjoy the look of, are still pretty bland and un-interesting. For someone like me who loves to customize and to make things look pretty... you just cant. Everything is so bland and boring, so much empty space I can use.    Number 2. In number one I just talked about buildings that would go on your mainstreet, Fast Food, Clothes Shop, Arcade, ect. For a game that is centered around building exhibits for your animals to stay in, it has only one attraction (other than the basic 2 viewing platforms) that attraction being the Gyrosphere. I like the way it looks and works however, thats all there is. In the movies  we had a host of different of attractions and unfortunatly we only get one on release of this game. I expect more to be added in the future possibly as DLC or whatever so this isnt to big of an issue.     Number 3. Because we are talking about the parks specificaly, I wish the people were more interesting, not so much as an issue as it is a personal preference, it just seems as though our guests are pretty bland and dont matter very much. I mean if a dino gets out and kills a bunch of people, its not a very big deal. In my experience once you get your park to that size you have so much money it doesnt even matter, you can just pay whatever you need and be done. I feel like one death should mean more than it does, if that makes sence.    So i think that concludes the park side of things, this next bit is more of the animal and AI side of things. See, the game seems to have been rushed. Universal wanted to release the game along side the new movie. Unfortunatly the Frontier team wasnt able to work out all the kinks with the AI and rest of the game in that time.     Number 4. Talking of AI, the dinos for one dont have very many actions. Because you will probably spend so much time watching them, the same basic interactions are really boring. They dont sleep, they dont herd, they dont play, the only things they really do is stand in this odd looking circle and roar at eachother and walk  around... oh, and eat. Thats about all, they do atleast panic and run from you or your other dinos. As far as what they do while just chilling thats about all. And because they don't herd, in larger herbie exhibits, one may run off to the endge of the fence, then procede to get royally pissed off because it doesnt have any friends near it, break out, kill some people, and thats it. But it happens all the time and its super frustrating to see the popup of a broken fence right as you're about to get 5 stars and suddelny drop to 3, plus, you have even more herbies getting out and its just a big fluster cluck. The most obvious fix for this is just have a herd mentality for animals that require a herd to live happily.    The AI does need alot of work. My main problems are that the dino AI is pretty bad as of now, as well as the guest AI running into enclosures :/ and I would like to see more customization for parks. Also, side note, the terrain, teraforming, and placing buildings down is complete crap. Buildings fit where they clearly shouldn't, don't where they should, its just poorly designed.     Again my main points are.  The dino AI needs to be refined a bit better. The dinos need more things to do such as activities.  We need more attractions for our guests to take part in, like the gyrospheres. We also need more cusomization and little things to fill in sapce and add an extra level of authenticity to our parks. Obviously, aquatic and flying animals.  I would also go for some new kind of transport along with the monorail.  All in all I say 5.75/10 This game can be so much more and a worthy successor to JPOG it just needs a little work. ",False,False

"Well that was disappointing,Sadly the game itself looked somehow well made from that era however it doesn't mean the story had to suffer or be rather not engaging for I finished the 1st chapter and legit had no reason not feel to keep going on with the game at all,And the pacing of a story is is rather off,as in most horror games from before the 2000's they didn't spawn you in the game and tell you hey you see that tower go there,for all I knew this protagonist had no reason to go there,He just needed to go there,I would been nice if we got to know this protagonist for a bit and live in his shoes for damm 20 min at least and then the horror things happen to him,but it seems he was in the roof for no reason at all as when he sees the monsters for the first time he seems to be unaware of that they exist no to be ready for them at all thus making him be in the roof top as odd as it could be,I legit can not recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the old horror games for this game just look like them but sure as hell played like one but the thing is they tried too hard on making the control feel like old games ",False,False

"Be careful, there will be spoilers ... I've been looking forward to this game for a long time. It's my favorite genre, 96% on Steam, what could go wrong? Well, basically everything ... The first inconvenience came right at the beginning, when I realized that I had to play for a black man or a black man (or as he might call them now not to be a racist). There is simply no other option, so getting into the main character may be a bit of a problem. I was further disappointed that this 'African-American' was an extraordinary professor of history at a university by profession. At the same time, I am well aware that the vast majority of people of this race act as rocket engineers, scientists and inventors, or at least top surgeons. Another shocking finding (and here I begin to suspect the authors of the game of racism) is the fact that this man is a convicted and convicted murderer going to prison. This is practically not the case with people with dark skin at all! But well, I won't let these inaccuracies ruin the game, I'll try to get into  somehow and show all those stupid white forks how to survive the zombie apocalypse! And lo and behold, the first zombies are approaching! Chacha, am I supposed to be afraid of them, am I serious? After all, they look like paper - such cardboard mannequins stained with watercolors. The 20-year-old Resident Evil had undead who aroused fear and respect. The 6-year-old Walking Dead is just a smile. Well, nothing, I press the paper machine with a key and move on. In time, I realize that this is not about zombies at all. It's all about living people and how I'm going to deal with them. At the beginning of each chapter, the game assures me that my decisions will have a direct impact on the progress of the story. Lie! As a result, it doesn't matter how I deal with whom, I still have to go through the only possible sequence of locations and in the end I will always end up in the same building. It doesn't matter if I vote in the party that I want to stay in a motel or travel by caravan - in the end the caravan will go anyway. I can vote if I want to stay safe in the house, or go to the water and look for a boat - but it doesn't matter, I just go to the water anyway. True, I can partially influence who survives the party and who does not, but it basically doesn't matter. In any case, almost everyone is gradually feeling it, and it has no effect on the outcome of the story. They and the characters from your party are so lean and unsalted, and when you come across someone a little interesting, they suddenly die or disappear from the scene (without you being able to influence it). However, if you come across an annoying feminist pussy with a boy's face (which can be more dangerous than all zombies together), be sure that it will drag you almost to the very end of the game ... Rather than an adventure, Walking Dead is an interactive film (with not very lively interactions), and the genre of this film is a reality show set against the backdrop of a zombie apocalypse. The game is done by traveling with your group from one location to another. Once you get there, all the party figures are standing in their seats, waiting for you to talk to them and take action within the location. When this happens, the paperworkers (sorry, zombies) will appear and force you to flee to the next location. And this pattern is repeated for 5 episodes. The interviews are lifeless (really no Tarantino, rather an ordinary soap opera) and the whole thing is nothing like that, no idea, no imagination, too American, if you understand me ... And I'll come back to those decisions. At the end of the second chapter, luck smiled on me and my starving group when we discovered an abandoned car stuffed with food. I should have decided whether to take the food or rather starve to death - because what if someone came back and had nothing to eat for us? So I logically said to myself: 1) I'm fighting for survival in the apocalypse and here they may or may not play for some 2) I'm responsible for party members 3) if someone is so stupid that he leaves the car full of food and still leaves the door open, so maybe it belongs to him. So I took the food and everyone finally ate, but one party member started preaching to me about morals and accusing me of being a monster. In the next chapter, however, the same young lady shot the other's brain out of our head for no reason and stole our caravan. So I call this a really sophisticated psychology of characters! But beware, that's not all - at the very end of the game I learned that I had completely ruined someone's life by stealing food, his family died because of me, and he watched me all the way to Chapter 5 to take revenge on me. Someone must have been a SuperMan, because he got to the end of the long journey all by himself, without food, over all the obstacles and crowds of papers - and he still managed to follow me! (after which he was let by a little girl). All in all, the Walking Dead is a huge disappointment for me - I would expect at least a slight gust of genius from a game with a rating of 96%. Unfortunately, I experienced several gusts of debility. My rating: 35% ",False,False

"Do not play it! New content, always new content instead of fixing the mistakes in the game ... What kind of mind is this, what kind of a mindset. Okay, I understand you want to keep the game alive, you extract content, but you don't place it over the corrupted content. Maps are always problematic, there are stutters, contractions, there are still glitches. First, improve the existing, add new things later. The point I don't understand is how the folks love it, how they love this ordeal. I play to accompany the friend or I don't look at his face. In addition, guys use Unreal Engine as engine, you know, Ulen is an engine badly used. Frankly, I don't like the graphics quality at all, it is mostly orange, the environment is bad, it is difficult to choose a man. I will say that in order for pubg to be a good game, it has to solve its problems and not produce new content. Even now there are server problems. In some of the maps, it is difficult to find players, the waiting times are long. If I say the game is dying, I wouldn't be lying and I think you deserve it, it was the place. ",False,False

"Review heading on the couch: today we will be looking at the absolute bottom of the gaming industry (only your teammates are more bottom-up). When you think that you have already seen everything, even Total Zalupu, then every time just remember this game. Drove to survey! I think it superfluous to break the review into categories, because there is practically nothing to talk about. Oooh Almighty, save me from unnecessary storytelling !!! He is simply not here! No, that's it! In general, the developer throughout the game, and this is by the way 1.5 hours, leads an e6any monologue about his friend in creating games. Clarification (!!!): he spends an hour and a half with himself talking about a friend as if he is a point-to-point person every day, along the way leading us through the ""games"" next door, and not a seasoned developer, which is this very friend. Actually, the whole monologue is similar to the story of one of the members of a gay family about a quarrel with a partner. This, by the way, is also the gameplay: walking through the most expensive under-games, listening to the monologue of some # uy from the mountain. Moreover, there are no melodies, nothing to somehow dilute this dull shit. The graphs, as you could already understand, are not observed here at all: no one has yet succeeded in shredding the reputation of the Unity engine with one game! Verdict: 0/10. The game costs neither money nor time. ",False,False
