"So, as for me this game does not belong to the Mafia series, although there are Joe and Vito there, but it looks more like a new series of games, I will not say that this is GTA 5, although there are similarities. But as for me, if it wasn't for the title ""Mafia 3"", then the reviews on Steam were much better. In general, this is not a mafia, this is GTA in a simplified mode. To begin with, THERE IS NO RUSSIAN VOICE HERE, EVEN IN MAFIA 2 IS. I’m stupid, I don’t even understand the plot, because I have to read all the time, but I don’t have time to do it, because you go and talk to you or the subtitles turn over like a yoban dream book ...

Sure the gameplay still is entertaining, but if you don't get your rewards it simply doesn't satisfy your needs anymore.

"First things first, Unity 3D. Who thought this was going to on the Unity 3D engine? Anyone? Nope. Why is it on the Unity 3D engine? Who knows. Whoever made that decision is the reason why this game has such horrific reviews. The animations, Frame Rates and over all clunky feeling the ENTIRE game has is most likely due to the engine being Unity 3D. Watch as you get a solid maybe 70 frames, then your sensitivity will skyrocket as your FPS dips to like 20 and it picks it back up. I ran this game in 1440p, on the lowest settings with a 2080TI and the entire time the game is open your GPU will be hard stuck at 99% usage the entire time this game is open.  Thats the Unity 3D engine for ya. Second stop on this ride is the Animations. A disaster in itself. NONE of the animations I saw ran smoothly/correctly. Many times your gun (Especially the magnum) will clip back to the last frame of the shooting animation, so it just jitters back and forth sometimes. The enemy movement is choppy, and whenever you kill anyone they all to the SAME EXACT death animation every single time. Think of a T pose, but with them holding a finger pistol and then just toppling over. On every single enemy. Completely ruins the immersion every time you kill someone. In a nutshell this is how animations are -   : 3 minutes of just WTF. Basically in the entire game Graphical wise - I didn't see many issues. It looked good when standing still, hence why the screenshots make the game look amazing on the store page.  AI in this game is also just a mess. I played on the second to last hardest difficulty. So basically hard, and in-between trying to aim correctly with the   and messed up animation you can basically just click once on their head and their dead. I barely ever even checked my health unless I was getting sniped, without the snipers and bazookas the damage input to you is next to nothing. I played up until the mission where you go into the tent to bug the guys office. No matter what I did, I always failed the mission as soon as I planted the bug. I hid bodies, did everything but as soon as the guy spawns in it was game over. After 2 tries at that, I gave up and started writing the review. In a nutshell, I do not see many of these issues getting fixed with the current engine and I do not ever see this game going above ""Mixed"" reviews on steam. Why they thought this was ready to roll out as a completed game is beyond me and is now on my list for THE worst remake I have ever played. For a full playthrough of what I painstakingly went through, you can watch the stream and click anywhere in the video to see this game in its full, depressing glory. By about minute 10 I realized I was in for a treat, and now cannot refund due to steams 2 hours rule.  My playthrough -  Some dumb lookin deer that just stood there and did nothing, but I remember it being in the original with animations. Just a derp deer - ",False,False
"First things first: What is XIII? A stylish and compelling FPS. While it doesn't exactly make any enourmous improvements to the genre, the story element is strong and the comic - style gameplay is truly enjoyable, even today! Multiplayer is another string to this games bow but hardly cutted. Overall this is a slick, enjoyable game so far (ONLY STORY WISE) - well worth owning and the multiplayer will hold your interest for ages. You are the victim of a conspiracy! Find your way out and uncover the mysterys behind the assassination of the President of the United States, William Sheridan. His death is a nod similar to real-life former President John F. Kennedy who was killed by a sniper bullet to the head in Dallas in 1963. The downside so far: No Bots and only two game Modes (Deathmatch and Team-Deathmatch), while the Original had way more. Plus the Maps are also cutted. A huge let-down in regards to the Multiplayer - but still enjoyable if you're looking for Singleplayer... but thats no the only con sadly... The biggest let-down: Multiplayer is not working as of now. You can select a Character but not go ingame LOL!!! This is a stylish and fun game that sadly did not get the recognition it deserved. Too many reviews gave it a thumbs down because it ""wasn't as good as Halo."" back in the days... Well, it wasn't trying to be Halo. Very well written, XIII has a compelling story that will keep you interested and guessing all the up until the cliffhanger ending. The music is superb, the voice acting is good, the cell-shaded graphics are very cool, and it is a very fun game to play. Some folks may not like that you can't save anywhere and that it builds up on ""checkpoints"" which are not that well placed. but that is sort of par for the course for Ubisoft of that time period. I highly recommend it. After all the games I've played so far, this is still one I think of fondly and plan to play again. Plus there are grappling hooks! The Downside: It also has some bugs (Not gamebreaking ones) in the Campaign. - Aiming is reaaaally slow while holding right click (You can watch around pretty smoothly but aiming is just slower settings-wise). Problem is: You can't change that (Not as far as I'm aware of) - Sounds are copy and pasted from the original (To keep the feeling in a newer and fresher look) and I like that! I dont need new voice actors because you know it as much as I do. As soon as your lovely series / show gets a new voice actor you immediately recognize it and don't like the show anymore. XIII Doesn't have that problem - There are a few frame-rate issues especially in the Bank Level. - No Ultrawide Support (4k etc.) - After the flashback on the beach, when it took me back to the beach from the boat I was greeted to the lifeguard having no pupils for half a second before her eyes rolled back onto their spot. - High Temps and might be unoptimized (You can see the typical outrage in the forums already) The last point is why I'm giving it a thumbs down. I play at 144hz @1440p and it should not be possible to overheat a 2080Ti with a Game like this while I Play everything else with 40-50 Degrees. There are also collectables (golden statues) to find all around the Level and it gives you extra content to find. It overall looks pretty good. Just do us all a favor: ",False,False

"Yeah, my playtime is low but there's a number of reasons for that, including dropping Windows 7 support requiring some jiggering to play it and simply not being interested in what the game has become. I purchased this game based on the product that it was... 6 yearss ago, and the roadmap supplied that continued it down an action rpg road that I really liked the look of, and I really enjoyed the alpha, then I shelved it since I expected updates to come and I didn't want to burn out... and then nothing happened, for years. Cut to January of this year and the developer put out another little bit of information as he had come to do every 6-12 months and the game was still moving towards what the roadmap outlined. Again cut ahead a few months and you land with the announcement of the game actually being released and I was excited, then I looked deeper and found that the game had had nearly every feature stripped from it to a barebones quasi-rpg with no true progression, no procedural worlds, no skill trees and on and on. I was unimpressed, and so was most of the community surrounding it. I'm not going to make this about the politics of what happened then but I will say that this was a game I liked, and now it is not and I cannot recommend it.

"I understand that the ""Adult Only"" Can give out quit a 'shock' to most audiences, making some people (like me) more interested in playing it.

The plot is interesting but really damn weak and unrealistic, at the beginning of the demo my attention was caught due to the somewhat unique atmosphere..But my enthusiasm quickly dissipated once i noticed the chores the player has to follow and the bad level design that pushes you to walking over and over and over again around the theatre without anything interesting happening except 2 bland jumpscares The combat system is buggy and sometimes hits dont sync.  The optimization of the game is unexistent and lazy. I was expecting more than a puzzle fetch game, i understand this is a demo but i'll be honest -- If the real game is going to be like this, then i'm not interested. Despite my annoyance i completed all the puzzles and well, the voice acting in the secret room once you hear the recording was pretty good and alluring to the story, so i'll give you that.

Coming up with 30-100 supposedly different items that supposedly improve the 30-∞ shitty bugs, but in reality we add them only for greater imbalance. 4. Coming up with FANTASTIC DESCRIPTIONS FOR FUNNING OBJECTS FOR IMBALANCE, and you need to vyserat them as carefully as possible so that this description is read 0-2 times and not for all subjects. 5. Coming up with an INCREDIBLY variety of NPCs with very good advanced AI, thanks to which they will be able to chase you as much as 2 (!) meters from their collection point. 6. Draw DOCHERS of beautiful, varied cards, thanks to which players will feel some freshness of the game, and put them all in one little pile of shit, giving as much as 0.0000000000001% variety per hour. 7. Draw some pretty good textures. 8. We put them so that all objects are spread out on the screen, or so that all the characters suddenly become skinheads. 9. We put several servers. 10. PR. 11.

"I am so disappointed with the developers of Undead Souls. I'd had this title on my wishlist for a while now, so when I saw it at 90% off the $9.99 price tag today, I didn't even hesitate. Apparently, I should have. Now, it's important to note that I hadn't read anything about asset flips or the poor reviews from Gun Brothers and Massive, so I really went into this blind and optimistic. I love a well-done roguelike, and top-down twinstick shooters are my jam, so I was expecting one thing but got something else entirely.  My major gripe with Undead Souls is that it's completely unplayable. I found the controls to be unresponsive with a notable delay between button presses and action. However, the swarming opponents have no such delay in their activity and made short work of my 7 hit points, usually before I'd even realized that I'd been hit with something. To say that opponents are seriously overpowered under the circumstances would be a tragic understatement.  The starting angel character fights with a sword, but the player still utilizes twinstick combat to aim in the direction of the swing. Unfortunately, hitboxes seem to be out of whack, because try as I might, I only connected about half the time. I stuck it out long enough to unlock the jester character, thinking that maybe a projectile weapon would even the odds a bit, but it did no such thing. Graphics and sound didn't even rate as mediocre. In fact, while I was playing, or attempting to play, those weren't even tracking for me. I had to go back in and pay close attention to even determine that they weren't worth my time because I was so overwhelmed and frustrated trying to get the mechanics to work. I was able to alter the zoom and disable screen shake, but that made little to no difference in gameplay for me. Under no circumstances can I recommend this game, not even at the 99 cent price I paid today. In fact, I'm submitting my refund request to Valve for this unplayable game the very second that I publish my review. With titles like Nuclear Throne, Enter the Gungeon, Streets of Rogue, Gatling Gears, Crimson, Feral Fury, NeuroVoider, Zombie Party, Hero Siege, Kill to Collect, Android Cactus, Utopia 9, Necropolis, Crypt of the NecroDancer, Dead Cells, and Full Mojo Rampage, you're sure to find a worthy roguelike or twin-stick shooter for your library.

"Cleaner or how we use a bow to genocide emotional waste. The game has funny music, the backdrops are ordinary Jpeg from Google, everything is extremely simple, but there is one thing that at least does not give me a positive assessment of this game. We shoot from a bow and it is the control that is done badly. To understand this, you need to try it yourself. In words this is so, you pull the bow with the mouse and after that it becomes inconvenient to aim because the slightest movement to the side and already the tension weakens and from that, you always have to bring forward to the maximum. In my opinion, the game turned out to be controversial and maybe the problem is only with me with the control itself, but an unpleasant aftertaste remains.

"I have never had so much negativity for any project ... Several years of early access (three or even four?) And the game has not surpassed its predecessor in any aspect. It seems that the second part was done by completely different people, while suffering from all possible mental disorders combined. As a result, if we compare with the original (yes, with the original, since this game is nothing else but a fake), what we have is: - Degraded mechanics. All mods are simplified or spoiled, half are removed. The game component has simply lost its relevance in this part. - Awful visual component. The game was made obviously for a blunder, without resorting to the services of professional designers or at least people who do not suffer from color blindness and lack of taste. It is simply unrealistic to achieve a beautiful picture here. Even modifications won't help. The engine itself is so poor that the picture can no longer be saved. I spent two hours trying to find an adequate skin for my favorite song. - Color settings R.I.P. Mods and skins replaced this great function, which, with the proper skills, could turn any composition into a color work of art. For several years of existence of the AS2 workshop, not a single adequate skin has been released. All of them are either vomit-acid, or pale-worthless. Well, fuck it, I didn't like the skins made by other people, I'll do it myself! Yeah ... Even googol and knowledge of English won't help here. I will not even describe how poor the process of creating modifications is. - Komunity R.I.P. All of the above just killed the social component of the game. Integration into Steam also did not help. The first part is still played by a lot more people, and besides, it is free. In the second part, you will not be able to launch anything from the classic British prog-rock of the 80s or Neo-progressive jazz (Something not popular and rare now) and after the end of the race you will see hundreds of other like-minded people who are repulsed from society. No. You can't find this here. Let me remind you that the first part was released in 2008, is completely free (f2p was always distributed outside of Steam) and is absolutely gorgeous. There is simply no point in playing this brainchild of developers' greed and laziness. P.s. Grammar and punctuation are in decline as at the time of this writing, I have 5 in the morning and I was tormented all night with attempts to relax to my favorite music. ",False,False
"The game is terribly optimized, the graphics in it, because of the shadows and the curve of Depth of Field, look worse than in Fallout 4 (and the water there is just a quiet horror), and the bugs that 76 was so famous for on release are nowhere have gone - I myself, having played only 30-odd hours at the time of writing the first version of this review, have already managed to see enough of wildly blunt enemies (and their corpses disappearing along with the loot), hard laying and receiving damage from nowhere, and once , having entered the game, and ended up in a completely different place from which it left, and even with a couple of changes in the inventory. In addition to all of the above, you can recall that this game, in essence, is aimed at cooperation with other players - only there is no point in interacting with them - except, perhaps, buying things at less extortionate rates than from game merchants, yes to help with daily operations and events, reminders of which pop up on the screen every three minutes when you least expect it - for example, right in battle. By the way, about the local combat ... It is much less dynamic than in the previous three-dimensional games of the series - due to the disgusting network code and very strange damage calculation - and it doesn't bode well for very big rewards. In fact, you will be lucky if you manage not to lose ammunition, but just to knock out of the enemy not just a legendary, but at the same time useful, item is an extremely non-trivial matter (and the option of exchanging legendary items with a unique NPC is also subordinate terrible random, in addition being very limited in ""bandwidth"" of this merchant). As for the plot and lore: oddly enough, I still liked some moments in them, and some characters (for example, it is here that one of the two hides in the entire series of normal Overseers) would even be able to evoke a certain degree of sympathy - if they weren't just voices on holotapes and, with luck, rotting remains. However, after going through the quest lines (extremely monotonous, by the way, in terms of gameplay) as many as two partners who were brought into the game with the release of Wastelanders, I can say that this is probably for the best, because the game simply does not know how to handle with live NPCs - and the bugs that relate specifically to them are so absurd that they completely discourage the desire to touch the main part of the add-on, where living people (who can forget who you are \ decompose into several copies of themselves \ on the go alter the made you in the dialogue choice) promises even more. One way or another, I won't be able to touch upon a fairy tale about some unknown Settlers and Raiders - after all, I want to explore the game world not just anyhow, but in a certain sequence, but the plot dedicated to getting rid of the Burning Ones cannot be closed even with a partner ( or to be more precise, a horde of endlessly spawning robots, from which you need to protect several of their absolutely helpless (and, it seems to me, also bugged) brothers at the very end of a rather long dungeon, stupidly destroyed all our stocks of ammunition and medicines, pouring all the progress into the toilet ) - despite the fact that we have accumulated good arsenals and both managed to raise the 60th level. And this is after the developers' statements that Fallout 76 is just a kind of experiment of the company, and you can absolutely play it alone. In general, the scriptwriters of the game still want to declare verbal encouragement, and game designers and programmers can go fuck their ass. In the end, the situation we have is as follows: if you are thinking of buying Fallout 76, seduced by the views of Appalachia (at least, Bethesda never had any problems with creating beautiful worlds), but you see how a person who went to ALL 3D parts of Fallout ( except for the console BOS), it discourages you from this in every possible way, then think about it - maybe this is just the case when you should regret your time and money?

"Foundation is the perfect title for the game, why? Because it literally has a good foundation but everything is very early access; It has the makings of being a good city builder sim like the others in the genre, however in it's VERY early access state it's a no from me. Like with most of these city builder sims you get to run your very own village, build up, and survive against hostile threats or the elements whether it be the weather kind or the sickness/virus kind; There is no tutorial level of any kind, only tutorial objectives at the beginning of every 'build' scenario, be very aware the river map (riverside or whatever it's called) is extremely broken or rather poorly implemented, that map forces you to essentially stick to land for most of the build before you even think of building your very cool riverside city. You do get rewards from completing objectives which is nice (kinda of). The biggest turn-off though will be the $30 pricetag for an early access. It's more of a $20 to me or lower, because of how much the game needs work, which btw the developers are listening and responding, etc. Look elsewhere for city builder sims, avoid this one for now until better systems, and better things are add in general.

"Watched about 5 hours of beginner's guide videos before trying out Story mode in normal difficulty (and even then played the tutorial twice over).  Pretty familiar with the basic concepts, except that after a full day of canvassing the area around a starting village, there wasn't ONE coconut to be found anywhere...  which means zero ability to drink clean water in the game.  Looked on the ground, looked in the palm trees... nada. Been playing other survival games for decades now, and this is the first time a basic need was completely absent from the game.  I finally gave up when my character died from thirst, even when I knew what to look for and what plants to find it near/in.  If I can't gather rainwater, and can't drink coconut juice, and get parasites from every stream nearby which forces me to hunt down the right kind of shrooms..  there's no point in trying to do anything else. Wouldn't recommend the game for that reason alone.  Needs some serious re-thinking for the starting areas of the Story mode map.  Might try again, might not - frustration is not 'fun'. ",False,False

First of all i want to mention the game is laggy and hasnt been really optimised.. When you drive there are sudenly in some points huge fps drops even tho nothing much is happening around. There is no currency or anything you can buy or story mode so there isnt even motivation to play the game. When you hit a wall the cars is getting destroyed so weirdly and bad. The Looking around is so weird sometimes it even glitches out (almost always) you cant even look around. The main thing i hate about the game its a huge asset flip That everyone can buy and publish it..:  The good thing that i coud actually see taht there were 10  cars that looked insane but compared to their looks they were driving so freaking slow! There were also alot of maps that you coud play on... even tho they were badly made.. - You can customize cars. - Has alot of tracks. - Has Trading Cards. - There are many fps drops - AI isnt very good... saying it nicely.. - Needs way more optimisation - Car damage system Just makes litterally no sense how they break so suddenly it needs way more improvement  - Alot of bugs and glitches but its typical  for Early acces games. - No Steam Achievements. - Its Asset Flip - NO story or anything why woud you want to keep playing - No currency that you coud buy stuff with Rating 3/10 Good thing its still in Early access and there is still hope that it can improve... ,False,True

"First of all, the game is extremely short. It took me about 2 hours to finish and the room was because I died so many times and in most places I didn't understand where to go. Guns feel ridiculous.

SECOND I started the game, there was a bug, the crosshair was left in the upper left corner and the UI was not visible. If you are going to play, play if you are a HEAVY Half-Life fan.

"It looks like I played the game for 4 hours because of Idle Master. Not realizing that the vast majority of reviews were bad, I wanted to install the game, installed it, started playing. I think the producer company designed the game as a mobile game; With graphics, gameplay, artificial intelligence, aim system and even intermediate scene transitions, the loading screen looks like it was officially designed for smartphones with a 4.5 inch screen. While I was reviewing the game, the mechanics of Gameloft's Mortal Combat (the name was like this, I can't remember exactly) kept coming to my mind.

"Yeah, not going to recommend this. Cool idea, implemented poorly.  First the neutral:  Basic Unity assets (which is fine by me, not that much of a graphics snob) and unobtrusive background music (which can be turned off.) Now the Bad:  For a physics game, there's no feeling of weight, friction, momentum, anything really. It feels slippery, like I'm sliding all over the place. Movement is WASD, turning and shooting is with the mouse. There's no sound or anything to alert you where the enemies are, so you must keep a constant AND speedy lookout... however, even with mouse sensitivity up to 150, turning to guard your sides / back was garbage.  After getting hit 4 times, you die.  I am not good at FPS and I KNOW this, but I CAN tell the difference between a good shooter and a crappy one.   Furthermore, just to check myself: I asked a friend (good with FPS games) and my youngest (very good with FPS) to play the game and they both had the same complaint regarding the controls as I did.

"<For Honor> As a highly anticipated work, Ubisoft's latest PVP work is basically the same as <Rainbow Six: Siege>. The 5v5 PVP competitive game in-game operation is just as good!

The game is not only very technical, but your equipment configuration is also important. Don’t you think that’s the only thing in the game.

"This game was, quite Frankly, a disappointment for me and many others. Having played TNO and TOB I couldn't help but feel I was playing an inferior version of the first game. Personal feelings aside though, here's the review: You play as William J. Blazkowicz (BJ), the protagonist of pretty much every Wolfenstein game. The game starts with BJ waking up from a coma. Nazis are invading Eva's Hammer (Captured by the resistance, now used as HQ). The story of the game is good. Not as good as TNO but still better than TOB.  The first problem appears in the first level of the game: The difficulty. Now, I'm a sucker for hard games, but The New Colossus is just a weird cookie. The game makes you feel like a badass, but try to stand still in a battle for two seconds and you're dead. It's not the type of hard that incentivises you to get better to do better, it's all just based on luck. The action in this game is completely dumbed down because of this. You'll either hide and hope you find a medkit or armor (that will get devoured by bullets in seconds) or restart the level to try a different approach. Here we get to the second giant issue I have with the game. TNO and TOB had two different ways of completing a mission. You could either go doomguy style and kill everything in your way but lose a ton of health or you could go for a silent way by stealth killing enemies without them knowing what hit them thus preserving health and armor for the next level. This diversified style of play brought in so much more replay value to the game. You simply can't do that in Wolfenstein 2. Trying to play stealthily in a level designed for reckless play? Good luck finding a place to hide! Trying to play recklesly in a level designed for stealth? You'll get shot down in seconds! It really eliminates the will to play the game again, knowing that you'll have to play the same way again This leads us to the last problem I have with the game: The level design. It is simply HORRID. There's this part in New Orleans: You are heading down a dim alley. You see two paths: The one to the left is lit up and has enemies coming out of it, while the one to the right is dark and unlit. Which path do you think is the right one? This is not good level design, and it's not the only level. You will lose just so much time wondering where you have to go. Time that could have been spent on killing nazis. As for the weapons, they are ok, not the most interesting but they do reflect the time this game takes place in. Even though some look like they were made in the Age of Steam, while others look really futuristic. The enemies I like. They are varied and interesting, from normal humans all the way to robot dogs breathing fire. Too bad Steam doesn't have a neutral review type. That is what I would give this game. It's not bad per se but compared to the last games, it's definitely inferior. Edit: Minor typos ",False,False
"If you suffer for a long time, something will work out ... Unfortunately, this only happens in anime, and in real life, efforts alone are often not enough. Indeed, the developers clearly tried, but the game came out frankly weak. Cons: - The size of the game. Obviously, in (it seems to me so) 20-25k words on the root do not fit any acquaintance with the characters, nor their disclosure, nor conflicts, nor the culmination. Everything looks very messy and crumpled. Timeskips for two months are generally a cannon! Perhaps it was worth choosing a slightly different plot structure instead of the classic novel. - Script. Almost everything is bad. The beginning seemed to be written by a man who with all his heart hates this business, but he was forced under torture. Further rue. Yui - they talked something, kittens, bullies, rain, the end ... What did I read, why did I read this? It just doesn't. Chinatsu is the only ray of light in this entire dark kingdom. But here it is not without fail: practically from the first lines, the main root confict becomes clear (at least to me). It's written quite well, the scriptwriter of this root knows his business, but reading a detective novel, knowing from the very beginning who the killer is, is that ... Even the final scene - albeit quite suitable - does not give the root a positive assessment. Megumi. Theater of the absurd, the benefit of autism! I haven't read such nonsense for a long time. 0/10. Shiro. Sluggishly. I just want to exclaim - I don't believe it! The point here is not even in realism, but in the general impression - everyone behaves completely differently from the way they should by the IRL or even in the anime. - Art. It's trite little. I won't talk about backgrounds - you can see them on the screenshots. Each sprite received just one miserable pose and a miserable pair of emotions. This stinginess looks especially ridiculous in Shiro's route. Moreover, many characters who have a lot of screen time allotted no sprites at all! TGs are generally mediocre, and they are also not enough. - Music. Too bad. Although the tracks are as background as possible, they are not only not remembered, but sometimes even annoying. I will note only 1.5 tracks from Chinatsu's root (especially in the epilogue). Pros: - A certain general idea, concept is visible, in some places - work on the setting, notes on the tops of the general synopsis. - Basically, the interesting characters of Yui and Shiro. Although it would be a stretch to talk about it, because they are not corny. - Not a bad Chinatsu root. However, it is heavily blurred by the evidence of the conflict. Total: Considering everything, the game is more attractive to the demo version; IMHO, in this form to sell it in Steam is a shame. Is it possible to improve so that everything becomes as it should be? Of course! But you will have to spend 5 more times for the same amount of time as was already spent on development. ",False,False

"I don't usually write reviews unless I see a potential but unfortunately I can't recommend this game at this stage. Game needs a whole a lot of balancing between production and consumption with the environmental events (such as invasions and the winter come). Your production is like never enough for what you consume regularly and you cant research or provide the essentials needs before the winter. About the invasions; it's happening so often you keep losing health and before recovering your folks, some other s...storm popping up. Needs more mechanics like being able to control your population's actions, free roaming -not stationary- security job assignments from the beginning and maybe grouping the security teams with some hotkeys, being able to occupy or deconstruct the existing buildings in the map -cuz hey! why I wanna build a house when there are a lot of em around- Needs a better AI -as many other already mentioned your workers just walking around the danger and waiting to be killed- Bigger maps with extended borders so we can actually pan around and see the inside of the buildings scattered around the edges.

I'll keep updating my review on this one as it keeps progressing. Don't get me wrong tho.

"Okay so if you dont want to read the full review here is a sum up: decent but short story. Large area to explore but it feels empty, decent items added but not many of them. Characters are good, well voiced and add to the island/ harbor theme a lot.  : The characters are well voiced and unique compared to the commonwealth NPC's. The rewards in the story are well done and appropriate for the setting and many of the new items are well done aswell, including the uniques legendary weapons and armors you can buy. The island itself is a good atmospheric setting with you having to always worry about rad damage and a fog crawler crawling up on you, the DLC places a lot of emphasis on how dangerous the island is. The children of atom were also well done. : reading what I wrote above you may be wondering why I didnt give a thumb up.............. This is because while all these things are good they are all overshadowed by how empty the world and main quest line feels. The main story line is basically one quest line that gives you the option of which faction to chose at the end regardless of how you have interacted with them( you can do all far harbor mics quests and have done none for the Children of Atom and yet you can side with the children in the end), its as if the choices we make are invalid and the quest is chummed up into one single decision. While the island itself is large and takes some time to explore if you are just walking around it just feels empty with few interesting locations outside the ones used for the main quest. There are five new enemies added of which two are basically from the base game but with new names(trappers=raiders, wolves= rabid/attack dogs), this means that wile there are three new enemies they get boring after 3 or so hours. Its not at all work the price tag( i bought it after look at some screen shots and watching some videos and it looked good), i was extremely disappointed by the sheer lack of content like they sort of slapped it together and added a decent sized price tag. I recommend waiting for a sale or just not buying it. With that money i could have bought two or even three decent games full of content.

"An interesting game, as the first in the series, you play as a Templar here (yes, in the trio it was played for Haytham for a while, but it was only for a while at the beginning). The main protagonist Shay is an average character. Despite the big bomb of Unity, the game managed to gain a certain place among the other Assassins. This game has, but a terrible minus in that in terms of gameplay it is (except for about two things) an identical game as Black Flag and releasing it as a new game does not sound very good to me - they could only give it as a paid data disc (see Witcher 3 and Blood and Wine) to four or at least not want so much money for it. Buy this game for the story of this game, or if you liked AC: 4 and would like to repeat it. In short, don't expect anything (except the story) for anything new or interesting.

": early access ≠ good. I will tell you right away where so many positive reviews come from - for me it remains a mystery. You can play something, but is it possible to get pleasure from it? Let's figure it out. The main thing to note is early access, which, to put it mildly, spoils the impression of the game - here you can safely write down lags, unsuccessful / unfinished combat, ugly graphics, not always successful soundtrack, lack of tolerable physics, damage that does not immediately break through ... meets us with a rather typical fantasy role-playing environment - some lost islands, the main character, a shipwreck who needs to assemble his team ... And it seems, not bad, but in this world there is still no motivation to study: for example, you can see something in the distance- then luminous - perhaps this is a hint of some kind of chest or at least beautiful crystals, as in the third Gothic (yes, sometimes even to gaze at a beautiful entourage is already a good motivation). But no, it's just some kind of bug that appears from time to time on various planes. It would seem that the situation could be corrected by a simple collection of resources, as it is well played in various cooperative survival games: from to, where crafting is interesting and understandable, and the discovery and extraction of new resources are not associated with great difficulties - the game itself will tell you what is needed to collect them ... Here, new resources are simply highlighted .. and that's it. You can't take them somehow, you can just look in their direction with a sad smile on your lips and move on. Of course, among these shortcomings, you can see the beginnings of an interesting RPG with thoughtful dialogues and a beautiful world, even if the graphics are far from perfect. Not a bad hacking mechanic - something similar happened in, if my memory serves me right. Translation into Russian is not expected yet, but it may be possible to wait for it thanks to the possibility of modifications from the community. It's too early to sponsor developers and hope for a high-quality final product: everything looks like a good half of the indies in Early Access, and not finished. However, there is a lot to learn here with the right enthusiasm. I will be glad if the developers bring their creation to the end and take into account all the shortcomings, but so far this game is difficult to recommend for passing. : + pleasant ambient music; + dialogues promise to be interesting. : - curve physics; - general dampness of the product; - one of the saddest battles I've played; - even at low graphics settings freezes. : Skyrim this game will not replace, but, in theory, can transform into a pretty good representative of the genre.

Although, I cannot possibly say that I'm satisfied with this game - I've played about 50 hours on my PS4 and a few on PC to be able to come to a verdict about this game which is still ... quite confusing and pointless It simply needs tons of improvements, which I think the team will serve, but it's still a long way ahead from what we all desire it to be. I feel so sorry for not being able to give it a ""thumbs up"" after their hard work but it is not nearly enough. I won't give tons of arguments since you can find them all in other reviews, but I strongly believe that it needs to improve in every aspect - from UI to Soundtrack, from quests to dialogue, from online to optimization.

"I do not recommend this DLC even if it is Freddy. The devs decided to gauge his overall power and balance around new players and not anyone with over 100 hours in the game. He has been nerfed into the ground based on bad players and one of his perks ""Fired up"" doesn't even work properly and the devs don't seem to care. So you're basically paying for a killer who is almost as bad as Wraith while the survivor and his perks are sub par. The survivor is quentin who is an instantly forgettable character from the 2010 elm street remake. Freddy is also massively countered by perks like adrenaline and he cannot even stop two players from healing a downed survivor until they are asleep which means he gets up for free...

"Armed with a water-gun inside a dance / stripclub, the goal in Wet Girls is to entirely soak the dancers clothes. Within a given time, without running out of ammunition and successfully evading the security guards. Gameplay and controls are rudimentary, moving around is done by the classic WASD keys. There are the options to pan the camera left or right and to zoom in and out. Some skill and patience are required to move to the exact spots. Squirting is done by mouse look and LMB.  There is the option to rebind keys, through the Input Tab page on the configuration dialogue before the game starts*. Although the Steam store displays the “nudity” & “sexual content” tags for this game, there is little that shows of these when playing. Clothing merely gets a bit of transparent, but that’s about it. Only the free DLC shows sexual content. The dancers move in a very fluent, smooth and natural way, however, an enjoyable feature. Every stage / girl has her own specific dance style and moves, music accordingly. As you progress through the levels, difficulty mildly picks up with each girl. At one point, a security guard is on the lookout and the player has to be careful not to squirt when the guard is paying attention. Simply implemented by adding a timer on top of his head. With another timer to keep in mind, this is a very annoying feature, it slows down gameplay for no obvious reason, simply adding frustration to an already obnoxious game. Somewhat halfway in the game, a freehand mode gets unlocked, would have been nice if there would have been something to freehand… To conclude: during gameplay, I myself never got into a flow or got immersed somehow. It felt a chore to complete the game and unlock its achievements. Developer definitively could / should have done more with this rather unique concept, a shame. Too short, too little gameplay, too little nudity made me recommend against this title. Bought this at a 50% discount to unlock another perfect game through it’s achievements. To find out later, this game is not eligible for a perfect game on someone’s profile. Cheers, SultanK *In my initial review I stated: “No option to rebind keys is available, which is rather uncomfortable for azerty keyboard users. Recommended to temporarily switch to qwerty.” This got rectified by the developer (WetGirl), and I adjusted my review. My apologies for providing the incorrect information.

The fact that the map is useless and basically you have to orient yourself 100% on account is another reason why the game becomes monotone.

"I bought this game because I am a fan of Kill la Kill and arc system works, that being said this game had big expectations, but when I played it, it left me with mixed feelings, so let's go over the pros and cons - The game really captured the style of kill la kill, from the anime shading, to the lighting to the exaggerated poses and angles, it really stays true to the original work - This game is really mechanically sound, it is simple enough to play casually, yet has enough depth to fill the needs of any competitive player - the roster is really varied, literally no character uses the same fighting style, even the same characters when changing their weapons fight completely different I haven't played online, but from what I've heard in forums and comments, the net code is pretty good, even playing with players from the other side of the world feels fluid - There are several game crashing bugs, and   of annoying bugs, like the characters shadows messing up and showing as horizontal stripes, the hud being illegible, and the screen going completely black. it seems as if it wasn't optimized for PC at all - There is, for some reason, a prohibition to stream or upload any videos containing story, in-depth analysis, or most game modes apart from versus, I understand why they'd choose to censor the story so that it doesn't get spoiled, but the other two? it's just weird they'd shoot themselves in the foot like that, that is basically how a competitive scene starts to grow - While the roster is varied, every fighter has a gimmick, and they have to stick to that gimmick, which in turn limits play style to that specific fighter. - The stages seem like there was very little effort put into them, they're just...plain - The story mode seems a bit draggy, you get several minutes of exposition dialogue cutscenes, whith a few fights in between. I liked the ending of Ryoko, though. - The other game modes are good, but don't seem very polished, specially the ""covers"" mode, that puts you against a lot of covers enemies, it's basically the equivalent of muliman smash in smash bros., the thing is, you can't lock into a single enemy, and oftyen you'll end up attacking the wrong covers just because it was closer to you - customization is really bad, there is only 3 colors, with one being a black and green mess, though this is something minor. in short, the game has potential, but if they don't fix these issues fast, this game is gonna die faster than you can say SEN I SOSHITSU ",False,False

"Being beaten up quickly is completely disgusting. Action games originally emphasized the continuation of moves, dodge between various enemies, and a series of moves to consider corresponding countermeasures. As a result, I had to press the button quickly in QTE. It's all the damn learning from the famous Takahashi. Eat shit, go platinum, I still feel bad about my handle. Oh shit! Hideki Kamiya, set against human operation, the shooting game can be left stick (aiming) + X (shooting)! Have you ever played a shooting game on the host platform? Right stick (aiming) + RT is standard configuration, okay! And it's really arrogant and mentally retarded to not set the keys! Are talented producers so shameless that they are so self-righteous? Or is it just him? I can't say anything if I want to design it this way, but if I can't even change it, it's too much to take players from other districts seriously. It is hard to imagine that this is Japan with careful workmanship. It seems that the decline of Japanese games is also in the ant colony. The last boss is purely disgusting, and the various re-use stages of fighting are really forgotten, and the moves that are hit by a second are not prompted at all. I think it’s a self-righteous malicious to the players. It’s just that I feel good. There is no difficulty curve, and the death is sudden. It deserves the divestment of the SEGA sequel. If I see such a self-satisfied production team, I will probably run away. . The biggest idiot is that choosing a new difficulty will overwrite the old difficulty archive! Yes, you read that right, except for the useless set/model/ost that you typed in extra, all the weapon moves you typed in normal difficulty are gone! I really took it! In this way, I don’t even have the motivation to study. It’s unheard of not to inherit at all in Er Zhoumu. You are the producer of the originator of Devil May Cry! Everyone in Devil May Cry knows to separate the difficulty archives, you just overwrite the archives! What is the point of asking people to play a week? The only thing that is amazing is the various protagonist moves and appearance and weapon settings. After reading the setting drafts, the professional setting drafts of clothing design with various marker pens feel that they are actually quite aesthetic.

It was a conclusion to the memories and longings of the year, and then went on. Platinum’s holster-changing action games over the years have finally consumed almost its reputation, TMNT, Transformers, etc., and Microsoft’s divestment of scalebound (hehe scared away an investment publisher). The second generation of the action Tenzun Capcom is really no one in the action design and cinematic interpretation. But I was brainwashed by MGSRR's OST and Shinkawa Yoji's setting and Kojima Supervisor's daimyo? This is not the platinum I know, is it? This is a good thing. Let it die and live. If you die like this, then it can be considered as a monument for the latecomers to persuade the world to persuade you. I believe that I am not because of the grievance of hand-mutilation.

"Unfortunatly, I have to give this game a bad review probably 5.5 / 10 (for now atleast). It is a good game and I love it to death, for 60 dollars though I cant say it was worth the money. It has some pretty big problems that make the game un enjoyable, atleast to me. Remeber to take this as my opinion and nothing else. First I'll start with one of the biggest things like I notice. Lack of customization. From the creators of Planet coaster, I expected more customization in the area of park design. These are a few of the things I've noticed in the customization area.    Number 1. Considering these guys made planet coaster, which has loads of customization, this game is sorely lacking in that area. We only have a basic set of buildings, that, while I do enjoy the look of, are still pretty bland and un-interesting. For someone like me who loves to customize and to make things look pretty... you just cant. Everything is so bland and boring, so much empty space I can use.    Number 2. In number one I just talked about buildings that would go on your mainstreet, Fast Food, Clothes Shop, Arcade, ect. For a game that is centered around building exhibits for your animals to stay in, it has only one attraction (other than the basic 2 viewing platforms) that attraction being the Gyrosphere. I like the way it looks and works however, thats all there is. In the movies  we had a host of different of attractions and unfortunatly we only get one on release of this game. I expect more to be added in the future possibly as DLC or whatever so this isnt to big of an issue.     Number 3. Because we are talking about the parks specificaly, I wish the people were more interesting, not so much as an issue as it is a personal preference, it just seems as though our guests are pretty bland and dont matter very much. I mean if a dino gets out and kills a bunch of people, its not a very big deal. In my experience once you get your park to that size you have so much money it doesnt even matter, you can just pay whatever you need and be done. I feel like one death should mean more than it does, if that makes sence.    So i think that concludes the park side of things, this next bit is more of the animal and AI side of things. See, the game seems to have been rushed. Universal wanted to release the game along side the new movie. Unfortunatly the Frontier team wasnt able to work out all the kinks with the AI and rest of the game in that time.     Number 4. Talking of AI, the dinos for one dont have very many actions. Because you will probably spend so much time watching them, the same basic interactions are really boring. They dont sleep, they dont herd, they dont play, the only things they really do is stand in this odd looking circle and roar at eachother and walk  around... oh, and eat. Thats about all, they do atleast panic and run from you or your other dinos. As far as what they do while just chilling thats about all. And because they don't herd, in larger herbie exhibits, one may run off to the endge of the fence, then procede to get royally pissed off because it doesnt have any friends near it, break out, kill some people, and thats it. But it happens all the time and its super frustrating to see the popup of a broken fence right as you're about to get 5 stars and suddelny drop to 3, plus, you have even more herbies getting out and its just a big fluster cluck. The most obvious fix for this is just have a herd mentality for animals that require a herd to live happily.    The AI does need alot of work. My main problems are that the dino AI is pretty bad as of now, as well as the guest AI running into enclosures :/ and I would like to see more customization for parks. Also, side note, the terrain, teraforming, and placing buildings down is complete crap. Buildings fit where they clearly shouldn't, don't where they should, its just poorly designed.     Again my main points are.  The dino AI needs to be refined a bit better. The dinos need more things to do such as activities.  We need more attractions for our guests to take part in, like the gyrospheres. We also need more cusomization and little things to fill in sapce and add an extra level of authenticity to our parks. Obviously, aquatic and flying animals.  I would also go for some new kind of transport along with the monorail.  All in all I say 5.75/10 This game can be so much more and a worthy successor to JPOG it just needs a little work. ",False,False

Nobody asks for a skill tree from POE or Grim Dawn but here even Diablo 3 had more stuff to power up their characters. Surely its main problem will be solved shortly with the addition of an offline mode and therefore it will be more stable but as a title it is not worth 30 euros in Early Access.

"Well that was disappointing,Sadly the game itself looked somehow well made from that era however it doesn't mean the story had to suffer or be rather not engaging for I finished the 1st chapter and legit had no reason not feel to keep going on with the game at all,And the pacing of a story is is rather off,as in most horror games from before the 2000's they didn't spawn you in the game and tell you hey you see that tower go there,for all I knew this protagonist had no reason to go there,He just needed to go there,I would been nice if we got to know this protagonist for a bit and live in his shoes for damm 20 min at least and then the horror things happen to him,but it seems he was in the roof for no reason at all as when he sees the monsters for the first time he seems to be unaware of that they exist no to be ready for them at all thus making him be in the roof top as odd as it could be,I legit can not recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the old horror games for this game just look like them but sure as hell played like one but the thing is they tried too hard on making the control feel like old games ",False,False

"Be careful, there will be spoilers ... I've been looking forward to this game for a long time. It's my favorite genre, 96% on Steam, what could go wrong? Well, basically everything ... The first inconvenience came right at the beginning, when I realized that I had to play for a black man or a black man (or as he might call them now not to be a racist). There is simply no other option, so getting into the main character may be a bit of a problem. I was further disappointed that this 'African-American' was an extraordinary professor of history at a university by profession. At the same time, I am well aware that the vast majority of people of this race act as rocket engineers, scientists and inventors, or at least top surgeons. Another shocking finding (and here I begin to suspect the authors of the game of racism) is the fact that this man is a convicted and convicted murderer going to prison. This is practically not the case with people with dark skin at all! But well, I won't let these inaccuracies ruin the game, I'll try to get into ♥♥♥♥♥ somehow and show all those stupid white forks how to survive the zombie apocalypse! And lo and behold, the first zombies are approaching! Chacha, am I supposed to be afraid of them, am I serious? After all, they look like paper - such cardboard mannequins stained with watercolors. The 20-year-old Resident Evil had undead who aroused fear and respect. The 6-year-old Walking Dead is just a smile. Well, nothing, I press the paper machine with a key and move on. In time, I realize that this is not about zombies at all. It's all about living people and how I'm going to deal with them. At the beginning of each chapter, the game assures me that my decisions will have a direct impact on the progress of the story. Lie! As a result, it doesn't matter how I deal with whom, I still have to go through the only possible sequence of locations and in the end I will always end up in the same building. It doesn't matter if I vote in the party that I want to stay in a motel or travel by caravan - in the end the caravan will go anyway. I can vote if I want to stay safe in the house, or go to the water and look for a boat - but it doesn't matter, I just go to the water anyway. True, I can partially influence who survives the party and who does not, but it basically doesn't matter. In any case, almost everyone is gradually feeling it, and it has no effect on the outcome of the story. They and the characters from your party are so lean and unsalted, and when you come across someone a little interesting, they suddenly die or disappear from the scene (without you being able to influence it). However, if you come across an annoying feminist pussy with a boy's face (which can be more dangerous than all zombies together), be sure that it will drag you almost to the very end of the game ... Rather than an adventure, Walking Dead is an interactive film (with not very lively interactions), and the genre of this film is a reality show set against the backdrop of a zombie apocalypse. The game is done by traveling with your group from one location to another. Once you get there, all the party figures are standing in their seats, waiting for you to talk to them and take action within the location. When this happens, the paperworkers (sorry, zombies) will appear and force you to flee to the next location. And this pattern is repeated for 5 episodes. The interviews are lifeless (really no Tarantino, rather an ordinary soap opera) and the whole thing is nothing like that, no idea, no imagination, too American, if you understand me ... And I'll come back to those decisions. At the end of the second chapter, luck smiled on me and my starving group when we discovered an abandoned car stuffed with food. I should have decided whether to take the food or rather starve to death - because what if someone came back and had nothing to eat for us? So I logically said to myself: 1) I'm fighting for survival in the apocalypse and here they may or may not play for some 2) I'm responsible for party members 3) if someone is so stupid that he leaves the car full of food and still leaves the door open, so maybe it belongs to him. So I took the food and everyone finally ate, but one party member started preaching to me about morals and accusing me of being a monster. In the next chapter, however, the same young lady shot the other's brain out of our head for no reason and stole our caravan. So I call this a really sophisticated psychology of characters! But beware, that's not all - at the very end of the game I learned that I had completely ruined someone's life by stealing food, his family died because of me, and he watched me all the way to Chapter 5 to take revenge on me. Someone must have been a SuperMan, because he got to the end of the long journey all by himself, without food, over all the obstacles and crowds of papers - and he still managed to follow me! (after which he was let by a little girl). All in all, the Walking Dead is a huge disappointment for me - I would expect at least a slight gust of genius from a game with a rating of 96%. Unfortunately, I experienced several gusts of debility. My rating: 35% ",False,False

I think it superfluous to break the review into categories, because there is practically nothing to talk about. Oooh Almighty, save me from unnecessary storytelling !!! He is simply not here! No, that's it! In general, the developer throughout the game, and this is by the way 1.5 hours, leads an e6any monologue about his friend in creating games. Clarification (!!!): he spends an hour and a half with himself talking about a friend as if he is a point-to-point person every day, along the way leading us through the ""games"" next door, and not a seasoned developer, which is this very friend. Actually, the whole monologue is similar to the story of one of the members of a gay family about a quarrel with a partner. This, by the way, is also the gameplay: walking through the most expensive under-games, listening to the monologue of some # uy from the mountain. Moreover, there are no melodies, nothing to somehow dilute this dull shit.
