"Well, press F GTA Online Due to the fact that it is handed out for free in EGS, there will be even more cheaters (by 300% if not by all 1000%) Although this game did not have a good anti-cheat before that, now it will be possible to create separate sessions only for cheaters I do not advise you to enter this game, too much grind. To buy yourself a more or less good enterprise, you will need to grind for a very long time on missions (and in missions you most likely will not come across players, so they may also not be very smart, if they do not rain at all, and if you have to restart mission) (Economy) is completely broken, cars cost 3 million, and in the most lucrative robbery you can take out 2 lem at best. (Inadequate in sessions) from pressure controllers who blow up anyone in their path, to cheaters who, with the flick of a finger, like Thanos, are able to (kick-crash) 50% of the session. If you only knew how much a cheater can save in this game ... In short, this game has been good for a long time, but it's time to retire (She is already 7 years old) If you play, then only with friends in a closed session, alone there is nothing to do here Game 6/10 ",False,False

"If I had to recommend this to someone curious about what PSO2 NA has to offer, I'd say nope. Straight up, the experience is a gambling addiction. I haven't played JP but I know the western release is a rushed downgrade of it, there's not really an endgame right now. PSO2 is an 8 year old game so many of the features will seem outdated. There are in game tutorials but they're vague, many will leave you wondering  . Some tutorials imply that a mechanic is useful and they won't elaborate on it at all so you can screw up your progression later.  * *I really can't say anything other than what everyone else will tell you. All you can do is search for online resources.  Anyways, I want to give you a scenario. Imagine trading being locked by a paywall. Yup, you connected all the dots. This is where I rant about  . There's a ton of customisation, items ect. It's more of a curse than a blessing, thanks to the classic 'we create a problem, you solve it with your money' business strategy. While it is optional to pay for the illusion of convenience, the tactics for luring people into handing over their wallet is akin to a mobile game. Regardless of you paying or not, you'll be screwed over by the damn fine print.  Extended storage? Subscription passes. Trading? Premium subscription or personal shop passes. Cosmetics? Usually bound to 1 character so you buy multiple passes of the same thing. Crafting? Oh yeah, you'll want a personal quarters pass for that. SG items? Can't be traded despite paying for it or taking the time to earn it. AC scratch is a gacha and percentages are a lie as long as you have RNG. As other people have said, this game is freemium and it should have been marketed as that instead of attempting to introduce new players to a disappointment. I've been enjoying playing the lackluster version of PSO2 and I have no clear reason for it other than somehow, finding it fun to play. Phashion is probably the only thing you'd care about long term. You'll be consumed by a vicious cycle of grinding for soon to be outdated equipment, praying to RNGesus, blacklisting meseta bots and trying to become your ultimate waifu. ",False,False

"Anime fans eagerly awaited the release of this game, with the promise to see the faces of Ryuko and Satsuki again. As expected, the gameplay revolves around combat, with voiceovers and the original work. So far everything seems perfect, even for enthusiasts in the field of anime games, but you will see throughout this analysis that there are many more negatives than positives. Unfortunately I was warned not to give about the plot, but I can say that chapter 1 of the main saga follows as expected: Satsuki immediately enters combat, and she will be the protagonist throughout this main saga. There is a side story that will be another saga from, now with Ryuko's perspective. Both sagas, with 10 chapters each, should yield a total of. This was one of the factors that disappointed me the most, the main content is extremely short. Aside from the Ryuko campaign being the Satsuki campaign in terms of enemies and the like, the only notable difference are some scenarios. Before going through any of the stories, we will have to do the tutorial, and to be honest, it is quite complete. Of course, the role of every tutorial is to be complete and everything, however some still leave something to be desired. Here we will learn to use and explore all combat techniques. it has one of the biggest variations of combos I've seen in similar games, and of course that was quite satisfactory because the fights were not so monotonous. The mechanics themselves were also good even if they are already explored in other games, there are characters that need to attack from afar to take advantage of the opponent. Of course, for games like this, I recommend using console controls. In addition to the campaign we can take advantage of other game modes like versus, challenge, training and we can even re-play the tutorial. However there is a shortage of characters, which was to be expected by the number of protagonists of the anime itself, making us sick quickly whatever the game mode. In versus mode we can play both local and online, in casual or ranked battles. Honestly the online mode was a total bore, as it is very difficult to find other players available and able to look for a match. The most you could do is invite a friend to and play with him. Because of that, I couldn't even test it or test the connection of the matches. About the visual part, there is not much to comment on, they are traces of the anime so to speak, but I believe that they could have varied much more in the number of scenarios. In the midst of the fights you can see that the game was not well polished, even when running in the home of the opponents it seemed that the opponents were moving in a somewhat blocked way. To put it bluntly, the minimum requirements that ask for something of this size only show how developers didn't care about optimization, and it doesn't even come close to the issue of particle quantity and quality of effects. During the game I witnessed several, both in and in. A, from what I noticed, there are only two and they alternate between the and the fights. Arriving at, do not recommend. The game brings a certain emotion, but it is a very short and exciting experience, which lasts about four hours if only the campaign mode is played. The detail in all this is that they really did not go deep in the implementation, titles of this genre need content to survive and not become saturated. They do not need to have a high level of exploration and the like, something in the footprint would already be a good size. The price charged is, at the triple A level, of much lower quality. Wait for a promotion, in the range of R $ 39.99 I believe it is chewy, even for anime fans. : This review can be read on the website ",False,False

"Richard was a simple minded boy. As a kid, he liked to play video games, he liked that feeling of empowerment when he shot enemies left and right in the latest Call of Duty. He liked to have fun. Life was simple. Then Richard discovered achievements on Steam and his life took a turn for the worse. Now his games had this phallic bar below their titles, and as boys do he wanted it to be as long as possible. But it was often hard to get it fully erect, with no achievement left undone. All he wanted from video games was fun. Life was already challenging enough with a name like Richard after all. This changed some months ago though. Richard discovered that more and more cheap games appeared on Steam that featured a massive amount of achievements. And best of all, achievements you got for basically doing nothing at all! True, those games were not good or fun, but gaming had ceased to be about fun for Richard long ago. He wanted those numbers, he wanted them so badly. And now he could have them, more than he ever dreamed of, with little to no effort! In some of those games all he had to do was press a single key over and over again. Heck, not even press it manually, he just went out into his parents' garden and fetched a stone which he placed on the keyboard. At one time he even had a wet dream about that stone, after a fulfilling day of thousands of new achievements. Then Richard came across Drive-By Hero. More than 5000 achievements made him instantly buy it. And it was even a shooter! He used to like those. Of course the game was utter trash, cheap assets lazily cobbled together, the gun sounded like some stapler gone on a rampage, the gameplay was even worse than he expected. Three levels, one boss. The introductory message sounded like the dev had voice-recorded it himself with a cheap webcam. But he had stopped caring about things like that by now. He just wanted those achievements. So Richard played. His trusty stone wouldn't do for this though: every time he died, he had to press the mouse button to start firing again. He had already played for hours and still was only halfway through firing all those bullets. While he stared and mindlessly shot at the hordes of zombies approaching him, his mind entered a zen like dream state. He remembered those good shooters, the fun he had. After a while, with nothing else to do, he even began questioning the game's logic, how zombies running into his tank could cause him damage, or why he kept staring in the same direction although his tank made a turn. He moved the crosshairs up and tried firing at the full moon instead, to not have to look at the barren monochrome areas or the cheap zombies anymore, but the crosshairs stopped just a few pixels below the moon, unable to ever reach it, and he died too quickly that way as well. Richard fired away at those zombies for what was beginning to feel like an eternity. The image of the approaching hoardes of the undead dug deep into that simple brain of his. Once in a while, a tear would roll out of his unblinking eyes. Ever so slowly his mood would get worse and worse. What was he doing with his life? After a while the zombies and he became one in Richard's mind. Finally, his face expressionless, he stood up, grabbed that heavy, trusty stone and went into his parents' garden once more. It was night time by now, and as chance would have it, a full moon was up, forever unreachable in that beautiful, clear night sky. He slowly, mechanically got down on his knees and raised the stone above his head. With force he brought it down, time and time again. He fastened his grip in determination as the stone got slippery from his own blood. Then the deed was done. The pain was over. As his consciousness faded into the void between the stars, he was finally at peace. This is Richard's story. Don't let it be yours. ",False,True

"There's too much positive reviews to not call it an organized campaign. The game has been made in Unity and I bet most of the models have been lifted from the unity asset store. Game can be completed in less than 15 minutes. It has enemies that are blind and won't hit you unless you choose to not kill them and just run past them. I was hit twice in my 2 minutes long pacifist sprint to the end boss. This game has only one level and it's extremely short, it has intersection of two streets in the middle of a city and a short, pointless train road that leads to the city from the house of a protagonist. There are no health pickups, no ammo pickups, no weapon pickups, you start the game with AK47 with 700 bullets and a rocket launcher with 100 rockets and it will suffice till the end. Main boss has a shotgun and he actually can aim, but you can easily outrun him or just jump on the building. Somewhere in the 2/3rd of his lifebar you'll race his friend (that will crash on the crossroads) and after that you'll fight him again. The End. The couple of screenshots in the game present all variety that can be seen in the game, so there's really nothing to see. One ladder that can be seen isn't functional, also most of the level geometry is simplified, meaning you won't be able to enter most building. Despite that you can still get out of bounds and run to the edge of the map, or bug the game out.  I am aware that this is a meme game but even meme games should have some content. Check VCB Why CIty for comparison, also made in unity by russian devs but with at least some content. This is just lousy. I'm pretty sure it's a student's project and the dev thought that a passing grade is just enough for commercial release. ",False,False
"This game has one big plus: the idea. The idea is really just great. We fly across the galaxy, looking for resources, managing the ship. What opportunities! You can create micromanagement of teamwork, conflicts between races, etc.; it is possible to create an in-game economy that will require the content of modules and people. And all this is surrounded by the fact that we are exploring the universe, finding other inhabitants of it, studying unique planets. But ... there is nothing in this game. The idea is cool. Everything else is missing. You just collect resources, use them to buy new modules. They only need electricity for their maintenance. People demand nothing but air. We collect resources, build new modules, collect more resources. All. There is simply no management on the ship. Can it be interesting to travel and explore the planets there? No. This is the main disappointment that awaits you in the game. All planets are a LITTLE piece of land in which vegetation and insects are randomly selected. When your boat lands on the planet, you simply collect resources that are scattered around the harvester. These are just stones that you need to go up to and hold down the button. Along the way, we fight off rare waves of local inhabitants. Sometimes so-called ""places"" will spawn there, where you can find artifacts. They are as dull as these ""planets"". Maybe the game challenges you? No. The gameplay is extremely dull and arcade, inadequately easy. AI is incredibly dumb. Enemies pose no threat to you at all. Beetles or humanoid creatures line up and stomp towards you. You can just shoot at one point and everything will work out. If you have experience in shooters, then the game will be incredibly easy for you. Imagine that you are playing CS: GO with bots on an easy difficulty level. As a result, from the description for the game it follows that you will try to start the genesis again and again, entering the game again and trying to succeed. In fact, I was able to launch genesis on the first try. What's the point in replaying this? ",False,False

"I didn't buy into the concept ... (DLC with season pass) -Story level (a little inconsistent): you play jack's brother who reappears 3 years after the start of the events of the main story and who finds Zoe her niece and tries to save her at all costs (right after the end of the not a hero DLC). The funniest thing is that this character lived as a hermit not very far from the Bakers ... Understanding with the DLC mini games challenges (off topic but funny) see additional story which is nice, here much less since it is supposed to close the incident. Same level of progress of the game: many inconsistencies with cutscenes to chain the levels where the main character loses track of a monster then finds it as if by magic in 10 cm of water then it disappears ""pouf"" or survives as per enchantment to a trap which should be fatal as in animated designs where the villain never observes the execution ... -Gameplay level: hmmmm NO, I did not know that faced with a biological weapon capable of destroying populations we can kill monsters (slime) with fist, see aligators .... Well here it looks like a horror game parody with superior craft than Mac Gyver -> a stick + bits of metal, or a chemical component = a bomb, a tractor (gniéh?). We are starting to have ""mecha"" also with some weapons and to note some hitbox problems on enemies (normal with bare hands ....).

"EDIT 2 : After the Iceborne update, Performance issues are back. I re-edited my review. Seems that Capcom achieved to create a ""regressive Update"" (yeah it's a contradiction, right?). EDIT : After the last patch, seems there are no more connection issues. So I edited my review. Big fan of Monster Hunter series, i was waiting for this PC version for a long time. Now that I have it I can say that for the most part it lived up to my expectations, they added many features that I hoped for. - Good variety of monsters to hunt: old as much as new ones (some are a dissapointment but    hey, it's my opinion). - The maps are gorgeous, and dynamic : you can use the field to your advantage. - Since the Online mode works fine, plenty of hunters to play with.   Good feature : your lobby can support up to 16 players, helps alot if you have more than 3    friends (old games were limited to 4) playing with you. - Iceborne is a good expansion, lots of new monsters to hunt (plus those yet to come) - The maps are bigger wider - The new featured tool Clutch claw is a bit too much, though it adds some flashy moves. The game at it's core is good but UNFORTUNATELY, and I think all those months of delay was alot of wait for a mere port with big performance issues:    - Alt-Tab when the game runs in the Fullscreen mode causes a crash...    - The game is even more taxing on your system than it used to be (90-99% of CPU/GPU usage, and I tried many ""fixes"") I recommended the game since 11Nov 2018, but as it is now I DON'T RECOMMEND buying it!

"Artillerists is like a really bad, unbalanced version of the old boardgame Battleship, which has been re-created as a video game quite a few times and much better than this. This is a complete guessing game, at least to the extent that I have played it. You can earn money to spend in an upgrade shop (the Artillery, where you buy ""abilities""), but you have to grind out guessing games to earn the money.  Whereas this is obviously a Battleship style game (obvious even before you purchase the game), what you don't know ahead of time is how unbalanced it is. By the third mission of the main campaign, you have 2 mortars in a 6x6 grid. The mortars take up one block each, so you can only take 2 hits and then you lose. The AI has more than 6 blocks of units in a 6x6 grid, and the game gives you no idea how many the AI has at the beginning of each mission. I haven't made it past the third mission of the main campaign (as of this review) because this is just a pitiful waste of my time when I could be watching paint dry instead. The AI also has ""abilities"" to hit multiple blocks, whereas you are stuck with grinding to buy lesser abilities early in the game, and they are really expensive and underpowered, particularly when the AI has some ♥♥♥♥ that can hit like 5 blocks at once as well as at least one airstrike (which hits 2 blocks) by this third mission.  You can use radar and airstrike abilities if you have purchased them at this point, but they are very expensive. When I say expensive I mean you will grind out clicking on grids trying to win missions in order to gain money. There are side-missions in which you can gain money, but the clicking and guessing is just horribly boring. In the game Battleship it's essentially the same, except you know what you're up against (the same units as you have, and there is a little more fun to the minimal planning and some strategy involved even though it amounts to guessing). This is just a poorly thought out game. Nobody likes an unbalanced guessing-game. There are people that pop up with irritating dialog as well, which just makes it even more annoying because that makes more clicks to grind out.  Count this as an extremely negative review. HUGE thumbs down! ",False,False
"TLDR: If you expect a Sanctum-styled game,look elsewhere. If you are looking for a fun defense shooter to play with friends, go ahead.  This game's art direction looks and feels amazing, but if you expect the game to require deep strategy in the tower builder phase, don't expect too much. I bought this game expecting something closer to Sanctum 2 which pushed both the tower defense and shooter parts further. This wasn't really it and was kinda disappointed but kept playing since it seemed like I had a misconcetion about the game's intents in mind. The game seem to mostly revolve around casual multiplayer game with friends, which isn't a bad thing in itself, and some good old run and gun with a few traps you can set around the map. Those traps are mostly to buy you time when you are looking elsewhere, there's no crazy combos you'd expect from a Tower Defense game. It feels much more like a pillow fort than anything else, really. If you want to play this game, the higher difficulties will require more team coordination than strategy, which can be annoying when playing solo. I didn't really find what I wanted in this game, but if you like playing any kind of player vs AI multiplayer shooter, this game is made for you. Edit: Rewrote the review as I didn't feel like it conveyed my feelings about the game the right way. This game's amazing even if isn't right up my alley. ",False,False

"Okay, I don't even know where to start throwing up? The last time I played the game was half a year before the release. I thought NO. Even though I was already very spoiled by PUBG at the time. I was also talking badly about PUBG at the time, but when you play H1Z1 you really appreciate PUBG. Now after the release I heard that there is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I thought to myself, well let's go maybe jump something out for PUBG Skins. But after 5 rounds of play I was more than served. Between the rounds I had a load screen of 2-3 minutes (the game is also on an SSD and the PC specs are below) and that on all graphics settings. And the game plays fucking shit on top of that.

"The highlight of this game is undoubtedly the graphic, it is visually very beautiful, with incredible landscapes drawn by hand. Gameplay is quite different from current games. The game is in 2D, but you interact with the environment in the 3rd dimension that is made in layers for you to continue with the path, these layers most of the game are easy puzzles to set the path for you, but in some moments you will have to solve some a little more work, those of the sheep were the most annoying. But still, the game doesn't hold you very much in the plot or in the difficulty, there are about 15 chapters in which you can finish in 2 hours or less. The soundtrack is very weak, not very striking, it seems more like an ambient elevator sound that most of the time you don't even notice is there, changing very little rhythm during the episodes. And the story is quite cliché ... basically telling it here would be a spoiler, since the game is very small and it is part of the narrative to find out why you are traveling. At no time are there dialogues or even texts to be read. And through moments of reflection, through memories, the player discovers what happened in the life of this man. Despite being a bit sad and portraying a novel, the plot itself was nothing appealing or exciting to me. I advise you to buy it only if you have it on sale, although it is not so expensive, it has short indie games that are much more worthwhile. There is no replay factor in gambling, as the story is very simple and easy to understand, there are no trophies or collectibles during the game. ",False,False

"Kingdom Come: Deliverance a ""good"" Rpg but .... Who wants to be realistic and immersive ... but the big downside is that the game is riddled with bugs !!! And how is this immersed in a game that wants to be realistic when suddenly a ""kingdom come: deliverance to cease to function"", savage appears in full face like a surprise cumshot ??? Hmmm I smell the fresh manure, j hear from here the cows bellowing and there heat of this beautiful sun caressed my face .... and there you go! A bug that takes you out of this ""reality"" to remind you that it is only a game, the the sound of the cows was ""love is in the loan"" which shot in the background behind you, the smell of manure was the toddler's diaper changed or the cat's litter, and this heat which caresses your face is not the sun but your computer which heats up for a long and big load of families ... I will not be totally bad with the game having 50 hours on it I admit not having finished it, not that I do not want to but when a bug prevents you from progressing in the game what to do except wait for a patch to fix it? And I don't remember that I bought KCD in early access, I don't recommend this game because I just have the impression that it is not finished at all, imagine my frustration, it is as if we offer you a film and we tell you: ""well wait, there is something wrong with the film, we will have to wait.-Uh ok and the rest of the film, when do I have it? -Bah that I don't know until I have your money that you slammed for my film the rest is fine with me ... - ha ok ... (it was the story of Jean-Michel Pigeon) I also find that the game is not worthy games that are currently being released, this game would have been a marvel if it would have been released ten years ago but it's just no ... the physics is crappy, the fights are nice (defois) but it just becomes incomprehensible by moment, when your brave hero is seized with spasm and you don't understand what he intends to do with those sword blows and the movements of his attack are unclear it's just abhorrent, the game is technically for me to the ram enough .... The bugs are numerous between loads, which do not end, characters who speak to you during a scene and who the following sentence are silent or speak another language, the quests completely bugged, the game that crashes randomly, up to you and your luck especially if after an hour of play without saving you have a nice ""Kingdome come: deliverance to cease working"" ... For all these reasons I do not recommend this game. Mafia 3 had received a lot of low marks because of these bugs, I find it hard to understand why for KCD it is not, especially since the bugs in Mafia 3 were less punitive than those in KCD. Because here no automatic saving to be able to save it is necessary to drink an alcoholic drink (yes yes normally when we get drunk we tend to forget bah here it is the opposite loul) Buyable drink from some merchants, or it is enough simply to sleep in certain places (not all) so that your party is saved, or even launched a fairly important quest, but if you are in the middle of the road without your little apple vodka bah adios the save (especially if your game crashes before). If KCD did not have all these bugs I would recommend it without hesitation Because in itself the game has a very beautiful identity, here no dragon or magic a realistic knight game without elves or crazy people, the villages are super well organized (hello Plaza) each village has its own identity, we really have the impressions of traveling through different towns, the map is really cool, even if the hero is a bit naughty I think that gives his charm precisely. The game is also full of humor, some lines of dialogue my good laugh, the choices offered to us are appreciable, and the medieval spirit is very well transcribed with a very complete codex on this time for the most curious of 'between you. But frankly, other than that, I want to say that the game is good .... but really nothing more ... JUST GOOD. I have the impression (and be careful, it's not an insult!) To play a skyrim dlc a little bit (but then really a little bit) technically improved and which is in another era without magic nor dragon to which we have to add and remove some gameplay sequence ....

"Pros: + Good selection of rally cars, both classic and newer cars. Although I miss some classics such as the Lancia 037 and the Opel Manta 400. + Stages are interesting and challenging. Not as good as WRC 7 and Dirt Rally though, but it beats Dirt 4's autogenerated bland stages. + Physics in general are OK. The game is more sim than arcade, which is good. + Very good and varied career mode. + 'Loeb experience' mode is nice. + Cars have their official livery. You can also make your own if you want. + Interesting historical info about the cars. Cons: - Very weak sound. I think this is the worst thing about this game. - Graphics are bad. A game like Dirt 3 has actually better graphics and that game is 5 years older than this. - Can't clean the windshield, which gets annoying. I recommend the bonnet cam instead of cockpit because of this. - Cars flip too easily. Can be very annoying at times. - Inconsistent AI. Sometimes you can beat them by 20 seconds on the hardest difficulty. Next stage you might lose by 20 seconds. Although most Rally games seem to have this problem more or less. - MP is pretty much dead afaik. - No community events like Dirt Rally, Dirt 4 and Wrc 7 have. - Co-driver is sometimes way off. For example: when he says right 2, it can sometimes be a hairpin.  - Sometimes the co-driver calls come very late (even if you have it on the 'very early' setting). That's a problem in France when you're driving a fast car with weak brakes like the Lancia Delta S4 and there is no time to brake. I guess that's what the rewind future is for. :) I don't recommend paying full price for this (29.99€) considering how many problems this game has. However, I bought the special edition for about 10€ and I think it's a decent game for that price. This game is enjoyable from time to time when I get bored of other rally games such as Dirt Rally and WRC 7. In conclusion: Full price: not recommended. If you pick this up on a sale: recommended.

This is unfortunately the case in this one ... During a trip by Robinson boat and hit by a terrible storm and ran aground alone (with a dog and two cats ...) on an island.

"Where to start with this game. There is so much wrong with it. From the developers to the foul community. Let me start with the community, because this is whom you're going to interact most with. It is filled with  ,   and others. I had the unfortunate experience of walking into a condo filled with watersports. The owner was a   who proceeded to inform me about how she sells marijuana in her own neighbourhood. She then told me that because she forgot to UV ray her product one time - she urinated on it instead and sold it to customers unknowingly, who reportedly liked that special produce batch. She then does this with her partner.  This isn't uncommon for this game. 99% of the houses will be littered with furry and water sports. This community is not safe. It is not functional. Most of the player base have something very much wrong with them - from being suicidal to just down right weird. The developers don't care about it either. I informed them about some condo that had hints of child porn in it. They chat banned me instead of looking into it. Way to silence whistle blowers. My friend also got channed banned but for entirely different circumstances. Another friend of mine doesn't play this game anymore because the community is so, so weird.  Moving on to the developers, ah the developers. Cut from the same cloth as the player base.  They don't know what they are doing with the game. It's poorly made and even though they have a road map, it makes it ten fold worse that they can't stick to it as an early access game. So, in conclusion. If you're a furry, or you are into animal watersports on humans and love to see child porn littered around condos - then this is the game for you. BTW, if you are wondering why I got this game? I purchased it for the golf mini game. I found out about the other stuff when I visited the public lobbies and condos. ",False,True

"Perhaps many will disagree with me now, but I want to write in detail why this game is in this response. I spent a lot of time on this shit, so objectively: Made by krivoruk, read the forums, read such reviews, and you will see that the shooting at CSGO is built randomly. More specifically, only two things depend on you - how quickly you aim and how you can control the recoil, that's all that depends on you. The rest is decided by the game, it itself decides whether the hit will be registered, this system is at the moment. Each of them had cases from the category: ""Well, I hit, I hit"", and so, you really could get, you just became this shitty system. If you want an example of normal shooting go to 1.6 Done absolutely stupid. Firstly, speed with different types of weapons, this is useful for dynamism, but if this is done correctly, there is no stability in the same garbage dump during shootouts, so PP and other less popular weapons become useless, Kalash and MKA are still imba ... About hitboxes: also full of feces, the game has huge problems with registering hits, you can see for yourself by running the display on the test card.

"Short review opening: I was disported big time from these game as a single play/VS player I used to play Tekken back in 1,2,3 and love the game back then, how you got to play each character and see a small story of them and now i am here with Tekken 7 that feels like they did not try as much, that they wanted you to just go multiplayer While playing the AI was clearly not trying, had times where i basically did something simple like stand in place, so they attack the air, or worst of the worst a bonus boss that was just cheap, i mean when you are laying on the ground, and all he dose is keep shorting a far range attack that cant attack you on the floor over and over again basically spamming that attack it dose not feel challenging it feels just annoying Or when you need to fight with 1/4 of the heal vs a boss that heals every second a little while you fight (and is blocking your attacks even while his attacking) Adding to that the Tea Break mode (AKA Rage Art) that was also in Injustice: god among us it just dose not feel fun when you winning and just as you come to give a punch time freeze and your foe lunches a Rage Art attack that you cant avoid or deny then, and takes around 1/4 of your HP But hey i don't play that many fighting games over all, but these just feels to me like they want you to play multiplayer, and trying to improve the game, that was pretty good as it was ",False,False

While the graphics is pretty nice, there are few enemies that look a lot worse than the rest of the game.

Besides that this game have bad game designs, camera in tight spots is just obnoxious, your turtorial is click punch to punch and kick to kick then they leave u with like 30 combo list and that's it, it isn't going to help anyone get into the game. Then they show you on basic enemies ""when it glows you dodge then times slows"" this is the only like 2 sec you can use to even try to do combos, becouse in this game you need after every atack just hold this button to stay still and shot/do something else, when every enemy besides starting will just ♥♥♥♥ you up then and without it you don't do any dmg. Then next enemies doesn't have ""glowing attacks"" and are even more obnoxiouse than camera becouse u have no way to tell what they are doing and you get kicked even without seeing this THEN even after you stunlock enemies and want to do something they starts to say NOPE and kick your ass for no reason, that's even worse than everything else. (One extra sin is that even if you dodge correctly most of the time you get sound for slow time, but it doesn't slow and it piss you off even more) You either plays street fighters and will get this combos or you don't and it's just impossible becouse u don't even have any place to train. And it doesn't help that ""style"" meter in this game is just bad for everyone start, you get panalized for everything, becouse if u get hit you have - points and this points doesn't even care if u spam same attack, it just get record of how many times you attacked. 2/10 this game is VERY BAD if you don't play teken/SF/etc and isn't a horny tenage boy that just wants to have camera shots on tits and ass and nearly naked main char.

How did she go through the greenlight at all? Yes, it is not worth a penny. In short, I do not recommend it. Oh yes, there are a lot of bugs and holes for textures.

"Pigmentum is a very basic reaction based game. To call it ""minimalist"", as the store description says, is both euphemistic as well as an overstatement. It's barebones: a block has to pass through blue, red and green bars while matching their colours and you can switch the colour of the block by clicking on the according buttons. And that's it. I'll give it that is is responsive, but the buttons are so widely apart that you have to both focus on the main screen as well as them. Simply allowing keyboard prompts would have improved this a lot. The game offers an optional retro filter, you can turn off the two different sound effects and set it to fullscreen. None of these options are saved, but you'll likely never touch the game a second time, since the gameplay doesn't offer much at all and the achievements can be completed within minutes. Even for a free mobile game this would be considered overly simple. Heck, even compared to the most basic of Atari 2600 games it's lacking. This is something people just learning how to code will be able to cobble together after their first few minutes to hours, not kidding.

"And now, 2 years after the release, I still decided to express my opinion about the folich. For a very long time I tried to write a review, but somehow there was no desire. In 15, I probably, like all fans of the folly, pre-ordered the game for 2k, in the hope of something unreal and interesting. I counted the minutes until the release and already imagined it as a waste for a month, as it was with the smoke. But, my interest and impressions lasted exactly 50 hours. After 50 hours, the game gave me one fucking disgust. Absolutely boring gameplay, the same random events, worthless plot, linearity. No interest in looting locations, but why? In safes, apart from money, silver, a little rare trash, patras and other shit, you cannot find. Where is the interest to find something unusual and secret? Everything is already given in random and quests in abundance. Hence the interest to travel the world disappears. Fractions? What's the point of them at all? Where the fuck is the ""Against All"" point of view? I don’t even want to talk about the plot with the ""awesome twist, which I have never seen anywhere"". The only thing that really made me happy was the huge and beautiful city. All the pumping that they were so fucking proud of turned out to be an illusion of choice. In 60 hours it was possible to make a universal soldier. Yes, on the one hand it may seem that this is the right choice. Give the player the ability to change his original build to the build he wants now. But damn it, why was it impossible to reset skills or retrain some special characters for a lot of money? At E3, they shouted with foam on their lips that in Fall 4 there would be the most seamless world. As a result: 2 seamless locations and a bunch of locations that have no seams (i.e. just a place in the wasteland, like there is a house and you will see a location with a name) and they have one safe. Well, without a seam? Without. Brilliant? Brilliant. Even though I have almost 750 hours, of which 700 hours I entertained myself. This is the only game in my memory where I tried to force myself to play the game and somehow entertain and have fun. All the same, there was so much waiting for a new fall ... My whole game was waiting for mods. It's not a secret for anyone that the mods for games from befesda play an important role. So I played 4 from one travel mod to another. Complicating the game, adding some kind of plot modifications from people, in order to somehow entertain yourself. Added new loot to the leveled sheets in order to diversify the loot. Yes, even travel fashions went into the folly after almost a year. For even the moddoders were divided into 2 camps: some remained in the old games, the new ones switched to modification 4. And the second travel pieces 20 maximum IMHO. Separately, I would like to say about the DLS DLS workshops. After the release, I had only one question: FUCK? At that time, the mods for adding items for the construction site were just darkness. What's the point of DLS if there is much more and better content in the mods? And about the whining eblanov who say that the construction in the game is complete nonsense. How can you listen to these people if these same people 7 years ago addicted to fashion construction sites in Vegas? Nuka world? DLS on which I had pinned great hopes turned out to be the most boring runner in less interesting locations for an hour. Plot? He is not in the DLS. The only track dls turned out to be Far Harbor with survival mode. This is the only DLS that caused at least some positive emotions. I don't even want to comment on the DLS about the mechanist. The game turns into a monotonous shooting range after 40 hours. Shooting gallery with the same loot, with the same gunfights. There are very few interesting quests from the whole game. Roleplaying of characters is zero. Interesting partners? Yes, they are all monotonous with a full set of cliches: Here's a mercenary who went to kill to raise money for the treatment of his child. Here's a drug addict who wants to be cured of addiction ... And the only character that stands out in any way is the robot Curie. The quests of which it was really interesting to go through and implant her in a new body. Want to choose sides in an in-game war? Fuck you. Choose: 1. Homeless people in plain clothes who want to embody the spirit of old America (WHY THE FUCK?) 2. Homeless people in the basement who dream of rescuing transgender robots. 3. Homeless people in power armor who want to kill transgender robots and those who protect them. 4. The totalitarian elite, which has been hiding under the ground for centuries, which has unreal technologies, unlimited resources and which flies away from the sabotage of the homeless from the wasteland for two times. I don’t want to talk about the poor hackneyed diaologists either, it’s a real drain. Even a mod that made a dialog box like Vegas doesn't help. Constantly ridiculous dialogues: - Will you help me? Kaef ... Of course, there are pluses in the game. An interesting, detailed world, an interesting character editor, a really high-quality jester component. The contrast is especially noticeable in comparison with Vegas. Interesting customization of weapons ... But what's the point when the disadvantages of the game are much more significant than the advantages? There was a huge potential in the game, which the befezda successfully pissed off. ",False,False

The new stability and war support systems too have made the game just that much more of a hastle, sure they add some ""realism"" to the game by adding a political layer to it, but no one plays this game to appease the countries people and justify wars, no we play to kick some arse and dominate the planet (I.E Europe). Another great example of a botched mechanic would have to be the new mobilizing forces addition, which makes making an army take far longer than it needs to be, especially if you're attempting to create a massive defence force in preperation for a multiple front war. All in all this game was good, but it is not anymore, unwanted and poorly executed mechanics mixed with a large learning curve and a annoying amount of micro managment have made this game even more broken than it has been for months, I wish I could say that if you look past the flaws it's worth playing, but honestly I can not and will not say that to any poor soul looking to buy this game.

"I downloaded it and requested a refund after an hour. The game compared to the classic arcade is definitely worth it. The game mechanics have been unnecessarily burdened with ridiculous combos and trappings that undermine the basic idea of the Capcom title that is a technical but simple and immediate fighting game to master in which the timing and the choice of the move or counter move are decisive for the game. outcome of the clashes, all that this SFV is not. Here you hit random keys most of the time in story mode and you win. Story mode by the way silly. AI to a minimum, they wasted no time in development and it shows.

"• Most toxic community I have seen in over 10 years playing online games, if you are doubting enter my profile and see the comments section. • Grotesque imbalance, the survivors have numerous advantages over the killer, the majority of the community is a main survivor, so they have a huge range of advantages (most of them, extremely OPs) over the killer, among them we can mention decisive strike, borrowed time and the infinite pallets that each map has. • Play 2 graphic that demands a lot from the machine.

"So I have finally played with Dear Esther, the one that invented the 'Walking simulator' genre. I was really curious what this game will be, and it was similar to what I expected. Some people wanted to create something new, something unusual, and for this reason they nailed it. But, something unusual not always equals with something good. I'm not saying that, this is a bad game, no, it's just ... as a casual gamer it's hard to talk about it, but those people who really appretiate the artistic part of a game, those might love this game. I'm not this type, so for this, the game get's a ""Not bad, but good is not like this"". Regardless of that, I'm glad I finally got to know this game.

However, the fact that something is unusual is not going to be good right away.

After playing a few rounds and really hard trying you get really quick into the game the controls and everything is very simple too. The problems is you often meet hackers in that game i experienced it often in game. Speedhackers and others take a bad influence. The community is ok in Coop in vs Mode its another story. I hoped for a good game in this one i hope to find a lobby where arent any hackers or crybabies so far  The thing in Contagion is there are many game modes which i will try but when survivors should kill each other theres a high chance that hackers will be involved there. So far Survivors vs Survivors is a No. If you play with survivors together its a yes.  greetz Akaya ,False,False

"We wanted it like Mirror, but it turned out to be another Hentai. What can you say about the developers of this game? At least the fact that they don't want to invent anything of their own, but they want to make a conveyor of erotic games. Whether this is bad, yes, in principle, no, but the implementation of all this is extremely upsetting. I don't want to talk about all their games, so let's talk specifically about this game. I have already spoken about the carbon copy of Mirror: the splash screen, design, short story, main screen and erotic scenes - everything was stolen from that game. The only exception is the changed gameplay to advance through the story. If in Mirror it was a 3-in-a-row game and it was really interesting, then here there are broken levels and an extremely boring implementation with the connection of balls traveling at the speed of a turtle leaves much to be desired. Maybe an interesting story here? Alas and ah, there is no short story here, dull dialogues, boring plot, and, in principle, the developers have at least some flight of thought and desire to write something interesting. For example, in the mirror, each heroine had its own plot, there was no main character who, throughout the entire game, only thought about how to ""play pranks"", of course, I will not lie, not all the stories there are stunning, but at least they are different and there are many of them. Yes, and there are 2 endings, although you can only influence them in bed scenes, but still a good idea. I gradually wanted to play mirror because of the short stories and the game of 3 in a row. But I can't say badly about erotic scenes, they were made in my opinion even too much, right in the best hentai traditions. After 3 victories over the girl, the first heart is unlocked, at the first stage the girl will be half naked and you will be given 5 actions (I don’t want to describe, but I’ll say that this is a classic of any hentai online game on the Internet), then you will go to stage 2, the girl will accordingly become naked and you will already have 9 interactions, respectively, the number of items for ""playing"" with her will increase. After 4 victories, a short hentai will open, where you can use the arrows on the sides to change the stages of this process, if you think that they are very different, then you are mistaken. And big and fat And, no matter how well people say about erotic scenes, I want to draw attention to one important detail, namely the sound during these very scenes. I think no one will deny that the voice acting of the heroines not only kills the desire to enjoy the gameplay, but even, I would say, repulses. It seems that they recorded the sound in the closet, even in the children's cartoon Fairy Winx the moans of the heroines could arouse much more, insert them into this game. And what is the result? It depends on the person who needs it, I personally could not get hooked on the game, despite the large amount of erotic content, I wanted either a normal short story or interesting gameplay, and as a result, the developers, as for me, are just lazy to the ass and don't want to invent nothing of their own, because they have a wonderful designer who can sell any of their unfinished game due to the erotic component. Personally, I don't want to support developers who can't even copy. As for me, starting with the game ""Hentai girl division"", which is not very different from this one, they start to slip. P.S. You can say that this is a review of mirrora, the ascension of that game, over this dermisch - please, say, comments are always open, I just wanted to let people understand that for the same money there is much better, where every element of the game is well combined and does not turn into something from the category ""as soon as possible to pass it."" Again, the only plus of the game is the scenes, but after the mini-games and the plot, I somehow suddenly got sick of it. Briefly about what is on top Pros: 1) A large amount of erotic content (the game has not only interaction, but also just pretty good scenes, although these scenes differ only in the speed of copulation and f_ckin c_m). Cons: 1) Unfinished (in places broken) boring, monotonous gameplay, which the developers have in a hurry tried to somehow complicate and embellish, but it would be better not to rush. 2) An extremely boring and terribly banal novel, which tells the story of a guy who could (he was able to fuck all the girls on his way).

In all honesty this game has disappointed me. For me personally Saints Row is a game of over the top ridiculous nonsense (at least in recent additions to the series) and this game is just not there.  Gat out of hell's plot is weak. The game feels like for of a Dlc such as how the saints saved Christmas in IV or Trouble with clones in the 3rd. I'll give you a list of the things I've liked and not Pro's • Good upgrades on abilities  • You get to play as Johnny Gat (!!!) • See some old characters from the series • The weapons you get are pretty awesome (though not a patch on the dubstep gun from IV) Con's • Annoying characters!!! (Can't stand the devils daughter) • Lack of character from the main crew - you only see characters such as Pierce and Shaundi at the start and end) • All the side quests are annoying or boring - there wasn't a single one I liked • The wings are hard to control • The map is quite boring • THE VEHICLES - can't save any and they all look awful • No music - like cmon really? • The game is so short - like who is going to get the 40hours+ achievement when the campaign takes 8 hours to complete  I love the saints row series!

"The game has reached its cynite. This is mainly due to the fact that the developers set the wrong milestones. Instead of taking action against cheaters and fixing network problems, they patch in new skins. You are very often killed by bullets from opponents, although you have been under cover for 5 seconds. If you gamble against people with bad pings, you have to look it up yourself because the hit registration and the kills are calculated by the clients and not by the server as usual. Bullets are often simply swallowed by the netcode. You storm a house, shoot first and empty half the magazine and your opponent doesn't die, instead you are killed by him. If you then look at the Deathcam, you can see that you didn't shoot yourself ?! If you manage to get into the last ten at some point, there is a 90% chance that you will meet a cheater who will steal your victory. I'm talking about cheaters that obviously cheat, cheaters chasing the heads of opponents through walls with the target circle, cheaters shot through bushes and treetops although the view is obscured and cheaters who only play Uzi, and shoot people with continuous fire at 200 meters without that a bullet missed. It is not clear to me why such obvious cheaters are not directly banned. The game is the best of its kind. However, it is so dominated by the deficiencies that you quickly lose your mind. Especially when you hear that Pubg turned over 750 million dollars last year, you might think that they have enough money to fix these problems. Pubg threatens to experience the same fate as DayZ.

"This review is strictly from a balance perspective. If you just want to play as Silent Hill characters then go ahead and buy this. I never played any Silent Hill game but I just feel like their inclusion is pretty faithful to the series they came from. TL;DR: Killer is not good and more importantly not even fun to play. Wait for the devs to change him. Why I don't recommend this killer:  Is he good? No, not really. But that's not why I don't recommend him. The main reason is that he is boring to play. Just simply not fun. His main power is an attack that hits survivors in front of you to a certain distance. It can also go through walls. So far his power is pretty good, but wait there's more. First thing is that when you go to the stance of using your power you can't go backwards and turning right and left is really wonky. Second thing is that the hitbox is very narrow and easy to dodge and after you use it you will slow down for a bit and give the survivors enough time to go far away. The most effective use of this power is to use it when a survivor is locked in an animation like vaulting or dropping pallets. So then the survivors get trapped in this scenario where if they get locked in an animation they'll get hit by your power and if they don't vault or drop pallets then you can cancel your power and attack them normally with M1. This will make it so faking your power is better than actually using it MOST of the time. And if you care about bloodpoints then he's not even good at that because to get deviousness points you need to hit survivors with your power. His other power is leaving a trail of torment which when the survivor walks or runs (If they crouch then it won't effect them) on they'll get the torment status effect. If you down a survivor that is tormented then instead of grabbing them and hooking them you can immediately send them to a cage far away from you. The cage is basically the same as hook but is faster than grabbing them and hooking them. The bad thing is you don't activate your perks that rely on hooking like pop goes the weasel. Anther difference is when the survivor is in their second hook/cage state then instead of mashing they'll need to do skillchecks. Lastly, if you down a tormented survivor who is dead on hook then you can immediately kill them. In my opinion this torment thing is very underwhelming. You can counter decisive strike I guess by sending them to a cage instead of hooking them but they need to step on the torment trail in the first place. Now I'm not saying you can't do fun stuff with him. If you manage to get nurse's calling on him then you can snipe survivors when they heal through walls which is pretty fun. if you use the perk I'm all ears you can kinda do the same thing too. But I don't think these moments are worth it in the end. ",False,False

"Geometry Dash perceptively employs a computative two-dimensional ""trial and error"" system and masquerades it as a rhythmically inclined arcade platformer that jumps into the mathematic realms of tedium. WHAT I LIKED: + Pick up and play. Geometry Dash, at its core, is an arcade game. One can simply choose a level dependent on their skill level, literally jump in and hope to complete it in what seems like a relatively swift turnaround. A rapid time-waster that never requires a vast amount of time and effort in order to complete the various deviously designed stages. Have five minutes to spare? Play through a stage or two. It makes the game hugely accessible for younger audiences who never adapt to the frustrations the game can cause, and also maturer players whom yearn to test their sharp reflexes. + Practice makes perfect. Robert Topala, the game's designer, kindly implemented a mode in which players can die, die and die again without having to restart the entire stage. This gives every player a chance to complete the level and memorise the sneaky obstacles and hidden collectible coins before attempting to challenge on the intended normal mode. Even then, some of those stages in practice mode can be taxing to complete... + Upload, download, play. Geometry Dash, despite being released back in 2014, still has a thriving online community of level creators and speed dashers. The amount of levels available for players to download and play to their heart's content is incalculably vast, with more still being uploaded as this review is being typed up. Fortunately, the intuitive in-game level designer makes this process quick, painless and surprisingly fun. WHAT I DISLIKED: - Geometry Dash is *not* a rhythm game. Whilst the pounding of techno music, the beats of dance music and the vibrancy of electronic music supply the game's official soundtrack, the levels that are designed around them do not supplement the tracks that accompany them. The player rarely jumps in time with the music and instead have to rely on a flurry of visual cues in order to navigate through the level. It juxtaposes the natural instinct of wanting to cooperate with the soundtrack, and makes for a weirdly frustrating experience. User generated levels tend to negate this issue, however considering most of the achievements and rewards come from the official levels it must be noted. - Vehicular mayhem. The robotic square that the player controls, flipping its sides to avoid spikes and other deadly traps, scrolls along smiling away. That is until it approaches a contraption that changes its shape into another classification of vehicular transportation. Flying saucer, space rocket, two-legged robotic dinosaur thing and many more. Problem is, they each employ a new control scheme that the player has to instantly adjust to before crashing into an oncoming obstacles and saying ""hello again!"" to the start of the stage. There is physically not enough time to react to these transitions and make it through the stage without having to rely on muscle memory. Who has the time for that? - Die, die, die, die...die and repeat. As stated, Geometry Dash relies on a ""trial and error"" mechanic in order for players to fully navigate each stage. The easier difficulties will require less time and effort, most likely being completed in one go (if you're skilled enough). The harder difficulties, as their categorisations might suggest, is near impossible to complete on a first try. Nor a second try. Nor a third try. Perhaps the hundredth attempt? The level design relies on memorisation of each obstacle as it arrives, where one simple slip up will send the player catapulting to the start over and over again. That's not fun. That's unfairly tedious. It does not reward players for their reflexes, but rather their capabilities of memorising the stage and persistently repeating the same segment for an hour or so. - Limited reward system. All the official levels, aside from two or three, are unlocked and available for players to jump into immediately. This means the rewards players earn for completing stages are only used to purchase cosmetic alterations, including new colours and shapes. Considering the struggle to complete the most challenging of levels, the available rewards are lacklustre and do not insight any motivation. Perhaps only to bang one's forehead onto their desk?

"Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice is a video game created by Ninja Theory, known for other projects such as Heavenly Sword, Enslaved and the not very well received DmC: Devil May Cry; on a journey about the mind of a character broken with a noble purpose that takes her to the most remote places of the underworld of Norse mythology. * Amazing graphics: beautiful and other grotesque. * Good combat system. Functional but uninspired. * Linear and repetitive. No replayable value. * Very pronounced disparity between the gameplay and what the game ""wants"" to tell. * The way you treat psychosis. (SEE BELOW) Never expect much from Hellblade, to be honest. Since the day my interest was announced I escalated somewhat more because of the fact that Ninja Theory was going to be behind this even though their games (especially the latest in the community) are not great games that are memorable or have a certain charm. specific. To be honest, my only reason for which I was interested was because it was going to be another hack 'n slash, with which they complied with that section having a not very visceral combat but not a show of lights and sparks, I would say something else "" raw"". What I DIDN'T EXPECT from the game is its intention, or rather its flaccid structure. To say that it is a “walking simulator” with fights in between and the odd puzzle is to be too generous, but at the same time what the game really offers, above all the great fragmentation between the gameplay and the cinematics. Of course, the game compensates for those few points to emphasize with some extremely beautiful scenarios and with others that will leave your mouth open. The story ... well, it's there unless you want to delve into it, but let's say it's ""understandable"" taking into account that we know little and nothing about the world we enter, except for the voice records in the game that we they teach some interesting things from Norse mythology. To dry, Hellblade is a functional game when you want, but terrible when you have it. Now, the elephant in the room: the portrait on psychosis. I'm not going to judge the developers' intentions to consult specialists on how a person with a mental illness deals with it in their daily life, but I assume that the game is quite pretentious. The only traces of this disease is when Senua is invaded by the voices of hers, other I of hers, of the other consciences of hers or however they want to portray it, but it is more that and nothing. Yes, maybe the way she perceives the world has something to do with solving puzzles but it doesn't lead to anything either. There is no specific mechanic or treatment in combat or some environmental danger that deals with psychosis, it is more, that it ""plays"" with the player's head and gets into the mind of a psychotic something like "" Eternal Darkness ”where the game (from a mechanical form) changed in order to confuse the player to panic or demonstrate other types of reactions. I think that, to what is considered a disease where the sufferer suffers from personality disorders or alterations in how reality persists, something more ingenious could have been done to complement the gameplay and above all the story that Hellblade tries in count, whose message is understood but leaving a bitter taste with respect to the entire package.

I would love to see it thrive again but until the devs come back and throw it into high gear then this will sit empty, and dead with negative reviews for the rest of its life, which sucks.

"I have never seen a solo game that requires you to log in at least once in three days or lose nearly all your progress. I don't think this is the innovation any of us need.  Just to make it clear: your land claim is destroyed if you don't log in within three days. Except for the items on your person, everything else - the equipment, buildings, items in the storage - either gets destroyed or becomes available for looting by other players. That is in the solo game on the pve server. If that is not a sufficient warning for you - and believe me, it should be; I don't write negative reviews lightly - let me tell you that there is very little sci-fi/futuristic/remote or near future value. There is no story. If the screenshots showing players raiding some sci-fi looking ruins led you to believe there is more to this game, there isn't. You build a house and you grind for resources. You grind a lot. Your missions are to collect x of resources, kill certain types of enemies, and reach certain areas on the map. And learn a bunch of skills on the skill tree. You build an eclectic mix of machinery that involves a bed that you cannot use (there is no ""resting"" in the game), a fire pit, a stove (and no, you do not replace or upgrade the fire pit with the stove; there are different recipes you can cook on either, so you end up accumulating what should rather be different progressive levels of equipment with the same function). Resource demands are ridiculous. I have posted on the forums that making a basic axe requires cutting multiple trees and smelting multiple - a lot - of ingots of metals, which is just not realistic the least bit, and the developer just replied that I got the numbers wrong. Guys, you are welcome to go and discover who is correct. It won't take long. It's the same story with every type of resources. You will need to eat like 15 steaks to not be hungry. Any moderately advanced armor, weapons or equipment require obnoxious volumes of resources. But fear not: there is so little to do in this game regardless that you can sustain just by logging in once in two-three days to make sure your land claim is still yours, maybe harvest your crops, maybe run maintenance if you let the building deteriorate a tad. That is about it. Oh, and there is no help. Good luck finding some of the quest areas like volcanoes on your own. The positives? It is visually appealing. But I wish I could get a refund.

"You may remember I wrote an extremely critical review on this game's release back in 2013, where I criticized some of the game's design choices, bad netcode, and DLC that made it extremely unpleasant to play. Going back to the game recently, it appears that at least the netcode issues have largely been resolved so (yay Relic!) on that part. A lot of my criticisms of the original release have by and large been resolved, though I will still point out some problems in the game. The publishers have taken the action of raising DLC prices on their in-game Store during major sales while giving discounts to make it seem as though you are receiving discounts off the item, which is not true as it is not only unethical and anti-consumer, but is also illegal in many regions. Should I also point to the fact that there are some fairly important bugs that were only uncovered recently despite the game having been released for quite a few years now (one being veterancy gained for reinforced squads). DLC I think is still a major issue for the game, but SEGA being SEGA... Some of the DLC do affect gameplay ever so slightly which can be fairly annoying if you're just starting out and don't want to spend money on the commanders. Last but not least, I'm happy they launched the game on Linux and Mac (though not too glad the multiplayer isn't cross-platform between Windows and the other two versions - explanation from Feral  ).

"That feeling when I didn't join the rebels. Do you give the right to choose? Come on and play. It's not about this game. There is a choice here, but if you do the right thing, then the game will end in the first episode. No kidding, there will be an inscription - your story is over and credits. Why ask if I want to join the rebels if I don't want to and there is no way out? Is it possible to dazzle on a more interesting plot, to lead the player further without stupid euro sentimentality and without raping the player's brain? (keeping the direction that was set by the customer) But the fact is that from a project, a wonderful project, with a wonderful history, they have turned into a springboard for the protection of these very ""values"". The story died when politics was pushed into it in all corners and passing them, the character will be subjected to ""choice"" and always take exactly that side, precisely those decisions that are determined by the scriptwriter's personal view of humanism, transhumanism and ideology. You will probably be surprised if you do not immediately understand the depth of the problem and say - ""in all linear games like this!"" I repeat - in normal games we just move along the plot, but here there is a harsh rape, subjecting the player to ""choice"" in the style of the last test of K.O.Z.A. from Fallout - who is the smartest and most authoritative person? Caretaker! Four options and everywhere Overseer ... in Dreamfall it will be like this: --- NPC: Do you want to join us? GG: No. NPC: Join us. GG: I don't want to. NPC: Exactly? GG: Exactly. NPC: We will give you time to think (NPC leaves. We are left in a closed cell and we wait for a while) NPC is returning. NPC: So you decided to join our great liberation army? GG: No Titles. --- And so every serious dialogue (in his style, so the ""credits"" are offered to us only once, as a hint of the future: eat or die). I rebooted, chose to join. I represent one of the GG, a nationalist by birth, brought up from the cradle and provided with a decent education, a great powerful superpower in the world of the Middle Ages and elements of steam (steam engines) punk with magic overwhelming. Only by chance, having met an episode of absolute injustice and a set-up, he ended up first in prison, and then the rebels saved him. This is not a spoiler, this is the beginning of the game - no need to howl. On their basis, he certainly joins their ranks (interracial ranks, where xenons are the key force). The first dialogue - the script introduces us to the look of a female xeno. At first, we are even allowed to show dislike for this creature, and a little later, GG almost confesses his love and if the dialogue was longer, they would get married ... Let's leave the dialogues, take a look at what they did to the world of the game - you can still understand the alternative history of our world , where in 2200 the most discussed problem of society remains the rights of nats and ""sexual minorities"", going to the synagogue is a mandatory manifestation of tolerance (yes, we go to synagogue), and evil Germans are eager to seize power so that only whites rule ... that I can understand (no). Simply because that society has passed a certain path of historical development and the action takes place in Europe. But when the same thing, according to the same carbon copy, the events are placed approximately according to the level of development 1000 years before our real world ... this is already too much. And what did you turn into the main GG of the last part, Zoya? I am silent about the fact that she herself was changed in the face, this is a different girl. I am concerned about her nymphomaniac tendencies. Instead of inquisitive energetic youth, we got a bitch who is interested in high quality and often fucks with me ... dialogues and her diary focus on sex. Well, swearing through a word is a very ""modern approach"". There was none of this in the previous parts. We were immersed in a wonderful world, in a kind, but terrible fairy tale! Without details.

Still, I love well-written quest dialogues and backgrounds. But here I found the pseudo decision so annoying that I quickly lost interest in the story. Don't give me a decision if it doesn't matter anyway! The only thing that allowed me to continue playing was the good fighting system. So if you want a blunt hack 'n' slay, you've come to the right place. Even if there are certainly better ones. By the way: The 80 hours of playtime are a bug. I played it for a maximum of 10/12 hours, then the combat system couldn't irritate me as much. ",False,False
"In general, I'm not happy with the game (A bunch of minuses wins a destructive victory over a small number of pluses. Cons - 1) Graphics - both at low and at ultra - the graphics were both soapy close and pixelated in the distance, and remained 2). - maybe this is after PUBG, but there is no shooting in this game 3) The game equipment works every other time - the snowboard can appear immediately - or it can appear in 10-15 seconds, the ice ax does not work 4) Due to the pixelation in the distance (although it was 55-82 fps on ultra) you can't see the progression at all, even on a large monitor 5) Lack of European servers Well, the pluses are originality in the form of a snow map and various winter gizmos, such as a cable car, a paraglider and a snowboard.

"This toy was purchased for easy (story) achievements. Your mother, how tiresome it is! No, I didn't rub the blisters on my heels. Calluses are rubbed on the middle and thumb, and here's why: the middle finger constantly presses on W, and the big one on SPACEBAR, because otherwise you risk getting stuck in textures. It all started harmlessly: I woke up on some unknown island and, of course, preferred to take a walk in a new place. I came across giant skulls, a railway 10 meters long and leading from a dead end to hell knows where, mills, a coal mine, a radio tower ... ordinary things that in real life simply must be on an abandoned island.

There are, of course, guides, but there's no point in them, when there is no map, no compass, no sense ...

"Well, it's a golf game. It's got modern graphics. It seems to have real world golfers, although as far as I know they could be just names on the leader board. I don't think you can play as them. I miss that. I miss the old golf games where you could easily play a round of golf on any course in the game (with many real courses to choose from) and many real world golfers to choose from. I thought that was the point of sport video games. Instead you create your own character and play as them. There are lots of accessories for you character, but most seem to be only unlockable with in-game currency that you have to buy with real money. Because microtransactions are the future. As far as gameplay goes playing is easy and works well enough, until you go to putt. Then you get to use a wonderful guesswork system that can have you accidentally barely hitting the ball or sending it flying 20 yards past the hole. This control scheme would probably work with a wiimote, but not with a mouse. You are forced to use this control scheme because consumer choices are not something big game companies like. In fact there are almost no control options--no key rebinding, only sensitivity adjustment. I don't find it fun enough or interesting enough, and as casual or non player of sports games, I find them to be very disappointing these days. I find myself thinking of all sorts of cool stuff that could be in them that isn't, and may never be. At this point in time, you are probably better off playing a pre-2008 golf/insert-sport-of-choice-here game. This still being $50 despite there being a newer version just seems greedy, and I would not recommend spending that on this game. I got it for $5. Might be worth $20. But again, maybe just get an older game. I seem to remember them having more real world courses and golfers, no restrictions, and no frustrating putting.

Go around back to see an endless void behind surfaces ❌ Combat is a trainwreck. No way to lock on enemies. Constant need to change direction to face them. You can run from every encounter and avoid combat altogether, making it pointless to waste time on. Some enemies are unarmed entirely, rendering them harmless. ❌ Very high regeneration makes you nearly impossible to kill. Higher level enemies can barely be damaged at all.

"This GRID 2019 is the reboot of the series. Well a reboot on a game of cars I do not understand the principle, but codemaster has promised heavy: better than the previous ones, rivalries between teams, .. of course of course. You can call it what you want but in the end the career comes down to a series of races / events with no real links, it's just stupid and mean races. Level content therefore we are entitled to 70 cars, 100 events and .... 13 circuits. Yes, 13. So we have Forza Motorsport 5 syndrome and you will quickly have PTSD from certain places since they come back ALL THE TIME. Also we start very poor and we do not have the means to pay for nice cars so we will have to do races and exploits (drifts, overtaking, etc.) which will give EXP and money. The first thing I was talking about was the rivalry between the teams. It was OVERSOLD by codemasters so worth it, huh? hahahaha, no. We can hire a teammate who will have such or such skills, will take as many% of the salary etc but in the end it is useless, in some races there is a rival driver, but beating him or not is useless. We also have a nemesis (often someone angry with us because we go too close) but that's no use. No, the only commands we can do are at the D-pad and consist of: asking for the status of the rival (his place), asking for the status of the teammate, asking the teammate to attack, asking the teammate to defend. That's it that's all. Knowing that 80% of the time the teammate refuses to defend or attack, well, it really is useless in fact. We can change teammate and hire another, but given the pointlessness, you might as well say that you will just hire the one who takes the least%. On top of that there is literally 0 driver customization and car customization stops changing the color of the decals, plus you can't even choose a sponsor anymore. Other than that there is no career development like I said so absolutely no depth in ""the rivalry between drivers and teams"". nothing, nada. Let's start with the atmosphere since there is none. The few musics present are frankly generic and forgettable, the sounds are quite good (especially in view of the pilot) and bah ... That's it. Ah no the narrators. My god the narrators. There are Kirsten and Alex who are there all the time and are mortally boring besides being dubbed by amateurs. Most of the time all they do is talk in the race to taunt you when you make a mistake, and your greatest pleasure will be to skip the introduction to the races just to hear Alex apologize for talking too much. Then graphically bah ... The cars are clean without being crazy, the destruction is quite good even if it seems that sometimes the cars are made of sugar. On the other hand the decorations are filthy, frankly. There are 13 tracks and most of them are ugly, the crowd characters have PlayStation 1-worthy heads, the trees are ultra low-res, and the buildings (eg in Barcelona) are textured in a hurry. It's so ugly that it's obvious when racing with the motion blur activated, frankly. How can we do so few circuits and not apply a minimum? No local multiplayer and otherwise we have races with 16 players and uh ... Well, the game would already have to be good enough for people to play it, eh so ""yeah / 20"". So we wait 5 years. Almost 5 years of teasing from an already adrift Codemaster, overselling his upcoming had and that's what they come out with. GRID is already half dead since GRID 2, never did anything better than GRID 1 and it's to release this stuff that they are reviving the license. Frankly if you want an arcade car game going everywhere except here it's not even worth it. ",False,False

"Disgusting game, even mods are not displayed. I liked the system of perks only by the presence, in principle, there is no such thing anywhere, but the disadvantages that you take for the character are always much clearer than the advantages. Luck is generally not clear how it works, there is no use from thick skin, all the same, the creatures bite through. Walls that cannot be pierced with anything other than a sledgehammer are still rolled out by zombies. Sheer idiocy. About zombies in general a separate topic, they are scum, the fifth point from them burns specifically. Although, for the most part, there are complaints about the control curve. I turned the mouse the wrong way - this bitch is already biting you, and even though the bite cannot be cured in the usual version, only mods have a cure for infection that can be done for ""over a million years."" You go into a house in the city, and the roof of the neighboring one prevents you from seeing something in the current one, good work. You go up the stairs to the floor above - there is a zombie. You hit him, you do not see the second because of another staircase that leads higher. Great job. PNG roofs ... well, nothing - a leg. About the system of pumping perks - a bombing topic. You play for three whole days, you train skills for the same ""overmillion years"", and then a break occurs on the server when you beat a zombie. Spark, storm, bite. And that's all, in vain he shook. Make a new character with different features, or you can take the same one that you had before, if you, of course, saved it. In short, not a game, but sh * t.

"When I heard about an Alesso Heist through a Twitter leak, I thought it was another practical joke from Overkill. But when addressing serious matters Overkill jokes, and when joking around, it turns out they’re serious. The John Wick pack was free of charge, and the Hotline Miami heist had good gameplay, good content, and wasn’t egregious when it came to the cross-promotion. But the Alesso Heist isn’t any of those. The heist itself is merely a one-day heist contracted by Bain (who else?), who constantly gives the celebrity of the hour enough shilling to qualify himself as a paid billboard. Alesso signs everywhere, product-placement for the musician all around and nothing but praise is given to Alesso when any serious heister would be apathetic at best. But let’s assume it wasn’t a commercial in disguise. The layout can be confusing for newer players due to the deceptive nature of the passage ways, never mind the dead-brained AI heisters who constantly get lost. To complete the heist, one must go behind the shops, go to the basement, then to the highest floor to hijack the concert (guided by an insufferable jive turkey), back down to the basement to extract the loot, then back up to secure it. In an undercover run one has to avoid detection in open and windy corridors while in a firefight navigating through the labyrinth whilst fighting the heavily armed enemies. There’s barely enough time to get from A to B without keeping these factors in check. Preplanning is absent. While this can be justified being a Bain job rather than The Dentist hosting the mission, the map is so large that the random-numbers generation that places the assets available is unfavorable. Not to mention the complete lack of spotters or spy cameras which would be useful for someone stealthing for the first time. The weapons included aren’t much to speak of. As usual the melee weapons are filler and often outclassed by others before them. The revolver sticks out due to being compatible with laser sights, but is otherwise completely forgettable. The Bronco usually serves better in its league anyway. Let’s find the positives in this DLC. Obviously the weapons provided make it theoretically higher in value than The Diamond, another controversial heist that lacked any weapons whatsoever. Bag-hauling has been circumvented slightly thanks to the chutes connected between the basements and the shops above it, in addition to the zipline deployed in a loud mission. The music, orchestrated by Alesso rather than Simon Viklund, is also enjoyable. The music itself cannot be adjusted and is synchronized with much of the gameplay (more so than usual that is). Sadly that’s not enough for me to declare this as the worst DLC-mission so far, more than The Diamond. At least The Diamond was enjoyable to play without friends, and had a more substantial payout. Those who are complacent in accessing every heist available should only buy this on sale, and not before obtaining everything else. ",False,False

"Destiny 2 is a good jerk off for a couple of dozen hours! It has good shooter mechanics, chic design and graphon, cool music, as well as it's fun to play in co-op ... The first 10 hours. The further, the more you understand that: The whole plot is just a repetition of the same ... You can go through the story quests out of order at all, but, for example, first you go to avenge Keido (frankly not understanding what is happening at all), then you go through the quest to find Keido on Nessa, and then the quest where Keido is killed and you vow to avenge him. Sounds good? The way it is! Quests, dungeons and so on are not regulated by the plot, as for example in WARFRAME. It is very monotonous. Literally, all you do is run and kill mobs, completing daily quests and other quests in order to swing a battle pass. Considering that after the 50th hour, I practically stopped changing weapons (why, if an exotic electro-PP that deals huge damage in e6alo is perfect for my electro-build) and just ran around with the same weapon, occasionally changing it to perform daily actions. The game has a division into classes and subclasses. Three main ones, each of which is divided into three additional ones. But apart from changing skills, they have nothing to do with it. 90% of the time you will just run and shoot. And if it comes to that: in Warframe, the gameplay is many times more interesting and varied. Since, in addition to shooting, there is a good close range, working stealth and good parkour, there are also not 9 classes (of which you can only use 3), but more than 40 unique classes + enhanced versions of some of them and a huge number of a variety of weapons, each of which, if properly trained, can go with you to the endgame. And I have not touched on the donation yet! Well, you know this donat. Currency that you cannot get in a non-in-game way and defective expansions that cost like an AAA game and give content for 10-15 hours. To be honest, I don't understand why people stay in this game. It will be really interesting to listen to people who spend hundreds of hours in it and enjoy it. Maybe they will give me advice, I still bought the penultimate expansions in the desire to get a good substitute for the Warframe.

"Okay, where exactly do I start?! I guess I start with the few postive aspects and I mainly will talk about the competitive part of the Game. The Game itself is pretty nice Pro: 1) Good sound engine and every weapon feels unique. 2) Good Performance: We have high fps, nearly no drops and a decent Server Connection. 3) Map Variety: Most Maps are very enjoyable and just slightly edited versions of the older CS/CSS Maps. 4) Many Modes: You can play Battle Royal ""Danger Zone"", Death Match to improve a specific weapon, community servers. 5) Competitive: I am just a huge fan of getting better and better and trying to reach a higher tier. This only made me grind the Game so hard. Neutral: Skins: There are really some dope Skins out there but dont you ever open cases.  Its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ scam...I invested more than 500 USD into this Game and got nothing but worthless blue ♥♥♥♥ skins. So just don't let yourself think you can make profit out of gambling...its NOT RANDOM with what you end up. Now, lets talk about the things which made me even write this review. Con: 1) A lot of f*cking cheating players! Some Cheaters play very obvious just to f*ck you up and some play more careful to make it look legit. But let me tell you there are thousands of cheaters in CS:GO. 2) VAC is the by far the worst Anti Cheat System ever! 3) CS:GO/Valve give zero f*cks about the fact, people are massive cheating in their Games. I believe, they rather wait over 180 days to ban a obviously cheating guy, because they hope he might invested money in Scam Cases and Skins...and if they got enough Money they might ban him 4) By the way seems like Overwatch is useless anway. 5) F2P ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, made even more people hack. 6) Prime or Non Prime doesnt matter...you end up with Cheaters anyway 7) My Steam Level is 42, my Steam Account is nearly 12 Years old, I have 0 VAC Bans and I am still getting those Lvl 0, not even 1 Year old Accounts with maybe 3 friends in their list...seems about f*cking right. 8) Toxic and Troll Community 9) The whole Matchmaking itself! Whenever I search solo, me as a German, always getting matched with and/or against 5 Russians, Turks, Indians, Pakistani or even Chinese Player. Which is just stupid! Do not get me wrong here but the biggest problem here is the communication. You cant play a very competitive Game like Counter Strike with people who cant speak English at all. You cant tell me there are no people playing CS:GO in West Europe.  How about giving a West Europe Player other players from West European Countries like: Germany, Britain, France, Spain, Netherlands, Denmark and so on...That cant be so hard. I already set my matchmaking ping to 50...doesnt work and as I said the connection InGame is NOT a problem. So always try to play with a FUL TEAM or with at least 1 or 2 Friends. So if you want to play this game competitive try FACEIT. There are not less cheaters and trolls but still there are some. Otherwise dont waste your time in Competitive Matchmaking. Ofc you can play DeathMatch or some other Game Modes but thats not a thing for me! As long as this cheating epidemic is going on: I ABSOLUTELY CAN NOT RECOMMEND THIS T-R-A-S-H GAME! ",False,False

"Far Cry 5 was a awesome game, yet it had it flawes as others would point out, was well balanced and slight longevity to it, yet the Far Cry New Dawn seems like a cut down version of Far Cry 5 a simple cut and paste map, added a lot of colour and left the game world at that. Most of the map from the original Far Cry 5 can not be accessed due to the nuclear bombs and fallout, yet to charge this amount for the game seems way too high. This would have made a decent Dlc for Far Cry 5 and close the chapter and get ready for Far Cry 6. But there is still a load of things that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me with this (Shall we call a Dlc) :-)  I am like others who like to explore there game world so completing it in 10 hours or less means you rush through it to get it finished. A lot of the voice actor return to voice the characters from the original Far Cry 5  and some do it well, others are a let down. Spoiler Alert: Father or aka Joseph Seed, is a watered down character, exiled and lives far to the north, he is not the character from the original Far Cry 5 as seeing as the nuclear fallout has cured his need for sun glasses, scratches his head a lot but also has the tendency to scratch his butt a lot. he is voiced by the original Greg Bryk yet this time seems like they cut the voice budget as he seems like he is talking in a bucket, the voice acting is a massive let down, yet seeing other characters 17 years later is a nice touch that some made it. Also seeing as I have not yet finished my play through yet, not once so far have I heard of the last PC from Far Cry 5 mentioned.  Boomer and Cheeseburger are no longer available as they most likely died also Peaches. So you get Timber is a scout, like Boomer and Horatio is a tank,  like Cheeseburger. you also get that stupid guy Hurk Drubman Jr, Pastor Jerome,  Nana a geriatric sniper who uses comedy dialogue to keep it alive, yet gets boring after a while. The Judge (stealth) Nick Rye the awesome pilot dealing death from the sky, Edens Gate could not destroy him and his family, yet these 2 little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ can easily wipe him out ( Something is not right here of course)  and some others, all in all this is not worth the high price tag, get it when on sale, read other reviews, some praise it others do not, yet I am in between those.  Some of the quests are tedious, rather stupid and have no point or make sense, and trust me the 2 antagonists in the game are not needed (They are like Hemorrhoids once you know  they are there you need them outta the way quickly, judging by what I see they have only just come out of nappies and now run a ruthless gang of Highwayman. annoying as heck and in my eyes ruined any good parts of this game. just a cash grab in my eyes.

"I don't understand people who praise her and raise her rating with their thumbs up. After all, 76 Folich is so shitty that it's just a complete suction. You can start with the engine with the simple Oblivion, which no matter how you finish it - it is still Oblivion's engine. And the bottom line is that such an engine cannot support online games consistently a priori. Is it really so difficult for one of the huge companies to develop a new engine, instead of feeding people with the flawed Fallout 76. The second nail in the coffin lid is its optimization, which also went down the road. And even on top-end assemblies, the FPS jumps like a bouncy. As for the world, there is nothing interesting there, that is, you will explore the map by passing the marker on the assignment. Because it will be interesting to explore in Fallout 76 only scavengers, who like a vacuum cleaner like to suck in everything that is not attached. But even they were circumcised. The limit in the workshop up to 800 units of cargo is a reason to save space and take only what is needed for crafting and upgrading.

"Welcome to version 3 of Berlin-Spandau! Nothing has changed at all. The developer has once again learned nothing. You start from the final stop, and before the first intersection a street backdrop. In addition, there are of course Spandau objects everywhere. Details? - A foreign word on this card. - The bus is so-so so far. It just has to be patched again because some features are still missing. For example, the ticket printer does not have a night mode, the display in the dashboard is always unlit, so that it can hardly be seen at night. In addition, the dashboard cannot be adjusted, which was previously announced several times. In addition, the Solaris logo is not included in the release version, although the license was probably present. ... and then there was the FPS thing; Even in previews / Let's Plays by the developer and the ""testers"", a bad FPS number was noticeable in heavily built-up areas, such as Bottrop ZOB, Gladbeck Oberhof, Buer-Rathaus. The point is, the developer knew about it but ""couldn't"" change anything. An absolute lie, no wonder the FPS is so bad there. The Bottrop ZOB consists of terrain & invis splines. In addition, up to 11 buses sometimes stop there at the same time. Traffic rules are not observed at all by the opposing buses, as well as everywhere else on this map. The cars keep ramming me from behind when I'm at a stop or a traffic light, the buses ramming me at the Bottrop central bus station because they simply pull through it inconsiderately, people fly over the map, run into buses, the traffic density is clearly too strong at 100% , sometimes kilometers of traffic jams caused by the lack of traffic regulations, and much more. However, nothing has been changed there. Although you knew everything. According to the creator, the map was already ready in August. The release date was only delayed because of the bus (which is unfinished). This time should have been used to check the map for errors. It cannot be that so many errors were not recognized! - The testers also tried to show off stupidly on Facebook or drive the bus on other maps. The argument with the ""50 lines"" and the realism is also nonsense. Of course they exist, but they're so unrealistic. Examples: 188: We don't need to talk about it at all. ;) 979: Turning right after horse market is almost impossible, and the mountain up is much too steep. The coolest thing is the developer's inability to criticize. If you say something negative, he literally sticks his fingers in his ears and does lalalalala; I can not hear you. He just doesn't want to hear about suggestions for improvement that cost him time. And before the mice get here; No, I'm not rushing for the OmSi forum and I wasn't sent by Janine either. I was kicked out of the OmSi forum myself 3 years ago because of a stupid statement. I don't care about the dispute between Gladbeck / OOF either. I am not partisan, nothing. I am only evaluating what I have here. And that's just rubbish in my opinion. Conclusion: Once again, it was all about money. The people were once again **************. Do you want a nice card, then take a look around in the OmSi forum. There are many more beautiful freeware cards than this one for 35 €. Good payware add-ons are, for example, the Hamburger (T & N / HC) and Aachen. You pay 35 € for a renewed Berlin-Spandau in a fictional version (comparable to ""NewBerlinSpandau 1.4""), and an unfinished bus, which is, however, good in the basic structure. Nevertheless, I would prefer not to pay 35 € for a bus that is currently not ready. If you needed more time, you should just have taken it instead of releasing something. ",False,False

"My first acquaintance with Sally happened when I was scouring the vastness of the well-known Chinese site in search of covers for 30 rubles. It was then that these same covers with, um, Sally Face, as well as pins, T-shirts, cosplay costumes, and so on fell on me. The incentive for the game had 97% positive reviews, while the ""like-minded"" ones included Downfall and Fran Bow, who eventually sold the game to me. And at first everything was really good. The visual part, which initially hooked me, continued to please the eye. Sound effects and musical accompaniment created the right atmosphere. The plot was intriguing, left a reserve for the future, the game tried to suspense! And this is only the first episode, and it will be better from now on? Later, the deeper I plunged into the world of Sally and his friends, the more disappointed I became. In many reviews, people noted intelligent, lively dialogues, but, as for me, they, unfortunately, do not cope with their main function. Any topic touched upon by the main characters, be it death or family relations, is absolutely not disclosed, and the discussion dies in the bud. The main storyline from a potentially good horror movie almost immediately slides into a bi movie with a 5 CP. The riddles here are mostly annoying than arousing any interest. Some of them are frankly rudiments that serve to artificially prolong the playing time. I also experienced the feeling of déjà vu repeatedly as I went through. Indeed, if you look closely, the author does not shy away from both using self-repetition and borrowing other people's ideas. Here we have a puzzle with doors straight from Prince of Persia, a narrative in the form of interrogation, as in True Detective, and a number of riddles from Cat Lady. At times it seemed that the developer was trying to compensate for his creative impotence with a heap of surreal developments. This can be clearly seen in the last episode, where parents demand grandchildren, and the author has not yet decided who he likes best - boys or girls. As a result, I would compare the passage with a tour of the apartment of a kleptomaniac-hoarder: there is no clear structure; There is probably something worthwhile in it, but it is difficult to find it under a pile of rubbish; You can walk, but why? If you are looking for something dark and atmospheric, I would recommend taking a closer look at Detention, Fran Bow or Rem Michalski's work. ",False,False

"A game that will deprive you of culture and destroy your personal life. It will improve your reflexes, logic, tactical thinking, and teach you to come up with cut answers to screaming children who want to fuck your mothers, grandmothers and sisters in record time. If you are lucky or have a lot of money, you can enrich your ego with virtual weapon skins that will make your rifle more masculine in the color of angry aquamarine. If you are the puzzle and the last zero, don't worry! You can blame it on lag, ping, bad gear, cheaters, hard day, bad tickrate, game physics, producer, hitboxes, screaming family behind the wall at any time. If you have time off during the events with CS: GO, you can spend this joyful time watching the tournaments and devouring more nervomix, because you did not drop the cobble souvenir again. If you are rich or just stupid, you can allow yourself to open a magic box with an even more magic key and try your luck in dropping skins. After all, a stupid is always lucky, go ahead. Then you can legally remove the stick from the anus because that back part of the body will hurt after another unsuccessful opening. As a consolation, you can always go to the yt and see another shit drop a scythe fn st not knowing what Edward is on Mirage.

Doing the same tasks from time to time (which, to be fair, are pretty cool implemented) is the height of masochism.

In general, there is clearly a problem with the servers .. This game is clearly not worth the money. Content is zero, diversity is zero, servers are shit, community - generally keep quiet.

My guns did short work of them, but i didn't see it. Controlling the helicopter is extremely easy and fun, i would had liked to see different enviroments. Some tight canyons or cities, something else than a free sky to fly. There are forests and little hills, but nothing that would challenge you as a player. You can hover above them and just shoot, move on to the next mob and repeat. Levels are short and the whole game takes less than an hour to finish.

"I was thrilled with this game until I died. The story was interesting, but gameplay-wise all your time is spent looking around and avoiding the monster. However there's no real consequence to being caught and killed, meaning the entire foundation of the gameplay is pretty illusory. I was no longer afraid once I realized death meant I was just reloaded back to a checkpoint. Since there were no other elements to the gameplay, and this one element was kind of boring, I didn't finish the game. All it has going for it is the story as well as the excitement of being chased.

"Well, finally, I finished this game, it took me a little less than 4 hours (this is together with the time when I just forgot to close the game and left on business).

But this game attracted itself not only with a large number of achievements, but also with a set release date in 2048, the game has not yet been released, but it interested me. And here it is in Early Access, and we get a bad runner, in which for each jump the player gets an achievement 4000 times.

The game is in early access and there may be a chance that the developers will read customer reviews and fix the game, and we will get a decent runner, but at the moment the game is bad and I didn't like it, if you still need 4k achievements, then buy, and if you don't care for achievements, you should not buy the game.

It's very good that I didn't have to pay money for this. The quality of the version for was even worse than that of the first part. It should be added that some cutscenes were cut from these games in comparison with the originals of the 2000s, designed to make the passage of the game more consistent. Various episodes in which Jonathan is shown from the side. Instead, the location screen simply changes abruptly. Many puzzles have not only been abolished, but also work every other time. You understand what you have to do, but the game does not react to these actions. Restarting the game helps. Simplifying the puzzles takes away the interest of the game, of course. They are not that complicated, and without them the game turns into a primitive interactive film - a dubious pleasure. In the very first level, for example, there should be an oil can under a tree. She's not there. With the help of this oiler, you can solve the problem of starting the water supply mechanism. And without the oil can, the very everyday logic of solving this riddle suffers and it turns out not even a simplification of the game, but its complication, because you have to sort out all the objects as in a typical ""Russian quest"". Didn't expect such blatant hack. And what is saddest of all, some scold these versions of the game, thinking that they were so in the beginning. It’s not like that. and are pleasant quests of the mystoid type, with a first-person view and drawn backgrounds.

"Another free game from Steam that initially had potential, but due to a series of problems, the game I consider bad. It's not so bad, as I said, it had a certain potential, however, the game left something to be desired. First of all, the game is a poorly made copy of Terraria. You collect resources for building sites that improve your equipment (you still need to build that equipment). However, unlike Terraria, where the resources are practically infinite, in this one, if you build a place and decide to demolish it, you can't get the resources back. The improvements range from wood, stone, iron, copper, bronze and steel (the latter being the best upgrade possible). You need to build the tools of these materials in order to improve your performance in the tasks (also Terraria proposes). You can choose between two levels of difficulty: normal and difficult (the only difference is that if you die in the difficult, it is permanent death, but the enemies and buildings remain the same, without the slightest sense ...). You can select between a male or female character and edit the hair colors, along with the attributes. There is only one dungeon in this game, where you also initially choose how many floors it will have (a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 40). Another detail, equally Terraria, is the choice of the size of the world, where you select the dimension of the map. To add the negative points, the character is slow and the distance between these points is irritating. In fact, the game's progression is slow, where each upgrade requires maximum resources. You can, of course, get all upgrades up to speed in no time, but you need to improve the houses in each process. The character also, if in case you only evolve instead of going to the dungeon, it is possible to reach very high levels without having to go through the dungeon, which loses the fun of the thing. Bugs are also boring. The resources do not reach the maximum if you are using the house workers in a certain function, which should not happen, because you are leaving too many resources in exchange for another one. Every time you load the game, the main items will ALWAYS be down in the inventory. In fact, it is not possible to arrange the inventory. The NPCs that come with the houses are stupid and come with the same basic items that you start your adventure on. The ideal would be to help them with better items, but investing in each one is a waste of time in such a dull game. Anyway, to finish, my biggest problem was a case with the save. I was at level 10 of the dungeon and saved. When I came back, the map completely bugged and I couldn't figure out which space to advance. Not to mention that, in this area, the game was EXTREMELY slow. And each time I saved, the size of the save increased in horrors. There came a time when the save was with 1.5 Gigas! I contacted the developer, however, I did not get help or answer. I had to restart another game. So I decided to do everything on the map and only go to the dungeon when everything was ready on the main map. Whoever is going through this game of curiosity, I do not recommend to spend all this headache. ",False,False
"A simple and short platformer that mimics the console old school of the 90s. And if in gameplay he does this mimicry quite well, then stylistically there are flaws. The game looks nicer than one might expect, but it still remains graphically primitive. Music is not annoying, but it does not leave good impressions either. The plot is at the level of those platformers from the 90s. The noir atmosphere is periodically felt, but almost immediately after that the game itself breaks it.

"I really hate leaving negative reviews. A game has to be really flawed for that to happen. This is my first negative. Why? Because it's Match-3. Forget the topic it supposedly covers (which it does extremely poorly). The basics of modern Match-3 aren't even present. You cannot swap tiles except by clicking on one and then clicking on another. Considering the timer involved, this is time wasted. Virtually every money-grab Match-3 has managed to at least get the drag-and-drop tile swapping correct. On top of this fatal flaw, I was able to complete the entire game in less than an hour. There's a reason Steam has chosen to label this one with ""Profile Features Limited"". Nothing about this game is redeeming enough to make it worth anything. It should be Free. I play almost all casual games with the sound off, so I'm not even going to bother with that. This thing is $8 full price -- which I didn't pay. The standard tends to be $1/hr. This is so far off base that the ""developers"" should re-think their purpose in life. ",False,False

I like the game but there many bad things so I will give negative review. let start with pros - many class - good art and music - good combat system now let's talk about bad things - many bugs - TOO MANY BOT and developer can't really stop them. I see bot almost every map I go and I just confuse that developer let these bot level to 100-200+ - Very lag right now - TOO FEW dungeon channel. You must wait for more than hours to do dungeons or spam till your keyboard broken. - Always gold seller message. Again they can't stop these people even they shout at center of town lol - restricted common feature example normal trade etc. They say it help protect bot and gold seller but outside town bot is more than players ... - Token system make too much different from Free and Pay player. You still can play for free but you will have a lot disadvantages.  - The pet is useless and take character slot so if you play hunter and falconer class you can only make one more character. - Too much grinding - EXP system is bad if you make it wrong you may get struck at some levels for a long time. - Many class is good and fun but they are really not balance for now and we will see most people play same build. - maybe more but I just forgot... Conclusion This is Free to Play game but I seriously feel like it Pay to WIN.  The restricted common system and Token that make to stop bots not work but I think it can stop free player instead. Just say that this is system to make people PAY. I regret buying the DLC and really want refund. I still like this game but many systems make it very bad for FREE TO PLAY GAME You can still play free for fun when it out But  ******NOT RECOMMEND TO BUY****** ,False,False

"I had fun in the first chapter, even though it was (understandably) easy, it promised a lot. Levels got more and more challenging one step at a time. After level 13, nothing really happened anymore. It was just the same level all over again. We have four buildings: Shop, cement factory, cake shop (huh?) and a factory. Shop brings us money, cake shop bakes cupcakes that are needed in the factory while building walls and cells. I understand that they have to eat, but still, cupcakes! It does the fit the overall look of the game though, it's bright and colourful. Background music made me smile on numerous occasions, it's exactly how you'd think it would be when looking at pictures. It's perfect for this game, captures the lightweight mood of the game, overly happy keyboard pop music. Based on how many stars we achieve, we are awarded with gems. Gems are used to buy bonuses that are faster workers, faster production and automated resource collecting. This is where the game starts to feel like a P2W game. It's extremely hard, nearly impossible to reach 3 stars without using the gems. It isn't about time management anymore, it's deliberately planned so that you need to use them. It takes away the fun from the playing, it doesn't matter anymore what you do. You are just going to click mindlessly and hope this level would be the last one while boosted by the gems. With them, the levels are too easy. So it's either next-to-impossible difficulty or very easy. The levels are also very simple. Same goals in multiple levels, with slighty different layout on the factories and few different blocks on the roads that need to be cleared before the resources can be collected. There is one positive thing though that engages the player. You meet gangsters and thieves that you must click a few times in order to eliminate them. Thieves bring a bit tower defense-vibe to the game as they slowly creep towards your warehouse. Of course, they became repetitive as well eventually. A gangster for example, appearing every single time next to my resource at the same moment my resource became ready. I mentioned the history facts and trivia quizzes. Facts were interesting to read between every level, even though short ones, just a few lines in a box. There are inmate names, info about their routines, escapees and rumours about alcatrazz. The small quizzes amidts the level then again test your history knowledge about alcatraz, giving you three choices to answer from. These were definitely the most interesting part of the game.

"Uses XBOX One controller. Will be added after clearing. The reason why this review is currently ""not recommended"" is that it is simple and ""it is not very playable due to frequent crashes (forced termination)"". We will change it to the recommended one as soon as the correction patch is hit. From here it will be a review of the content of the game itself. ------- An open-world 3D action RPG set in a world where mechanical beasts dominate the earth. Become the main character ""Arroy"" and explore your own birth and the secrets of the world. Although it is an action RPG in terms of genre, it is a strong work. Since this work is made to strongly feel the influence of various works, I will mention it a little in this review. ◆ Although it is a post-apocalyptic work, it is very attractive because it has a unique world view and is full of originality. The appearance of mechanical beasts and uniquely designed ""mechanical beasts"" running through an environment overgrown with vegetation is even fantastic, and it looks like a giant crocodile that appears near the waterside. Will scare the player. If you dare to mention a work set in an environment or world similar to this work, would ""Enslaved"" be similar? However, there is a drawback that there are few changes in the environment and there are many similar places. On the contrary, in ""Horizon"", the player will visit various locations such as ""Forest"", ""Ruins"", ""Meadow"", and ""Snow Mountain"" as the adventure progresses. Weather changes such as ""rain"", ""snow"", and ""storm"" also occur. The quality of the simple environment itself is high, and there is fun in ""what is waiting for the player next"" and ""exploring an unknown area"", so you can play with excitement. In addition, as a matter of course, changes in the environment are directly linked to the action side. I will do the following about that. ◆ In open world works, it is important not to waste a vast map. In addition to fascinating players with location and footage as described above, this work, like many other works of the same type, takes advantage of side quests and maps to keep players from getting bored, and much more. Activities are available. By advancing the main story, the range of action of the main character will expand. As the range of activities expands, even one move requires not only walking around, but also climbing mountains and cliffs depending on the environment. In such a case, you will use the climbing (climbing the wall) action that is often seen in works such as ""Uncharted"", ""Tomb Raider"", and ""Assassin's Creed"". It's the one that sticks to walls and rocks and jumps. Climbing actions are also used when climbing certain mechanical beasts. For example, in each area, huge mechanical beasts reminiscent of ""Brachiosaurus"" are wandering around, and by climbing them and using the skill ""Override"", the activity of that area is displayed on the map. Will be. Climbing Brachiosaurus is surprisingly difficult, and you'll have to find a reasonably high terrain and jump to them. It's also interesting to find and explore this jumping place. By the way, except for the appearance of ""Brachiosaurus"", the system itself that will display this activity is a familiar system that can be seen in the ""Assassin's Creed"" series and ""Far Cry"". The story changes a little, but by using the skill ""Override"" mentioned above for a specific mechanical beast, it becomes possible to use the target mechanical beast. Since it is a work that can also be used for fast travel, there are few opportunities to operate it, but it is possible to board the mechanical beast that is being used and move the map. As an aside, the activity display and the navigation system around the UI and players of this work are sophisticated and quite kind. It takes advantage of other open world works and evolves a difficult-to-use system. Thanks to that, I didn't feel any stress during the search. ◆ Because the work is mainly action, some people may be concerned about the difficulty level. In this work, the difficulty level of the game can be selected from six to start, and the simplest one is ""Story"", ""Easy"", ""Normal"", ""Hard"", ""Very Hard"", and ""Ultra Hard"". Even if you are not good at action, as the name suggests, ""Story"" will allow you to enjoy the story of the main story without any problems. The difficulty level itself can be changed at any time from the options in the game, so it's a good idea to change it according to the skill of the player. Now, regarding the action side, I get the impression that the elements of ""currently trendy works"" are incorporated anyway. This is not a bad thing, it means that I took the good points of other works and adjusted for this work. The fighting means of this work are ambiguous, and it is possible to stand around strategically. We will select and introduce some important elements from them. The main battle is a long-range attack using a bow or sling. It's possible to fight at close range, but it's not a very wise choice against giant mechanical beasts. In long-distance battles, a skill called ""spiritual unification"" is very useful. This skill has a so-called ""bullet time"" effect, and can be used to temporarily slow down the flow of time. Even if you're not good at aiming, you can cheat to some extent. The writer was very helpful. Well, if this work is only a simple long-distance battle, that is not the case.For example, whether it is people who are hostile to the main character or mechanical beasts, in this work there are many enemies forming a flock. It is better to use ""Stealth"" to reduce the number of enemies before starting the battle. When performing ""Stealth"", a system called ""Focus"" that seems to refer to the ""Investigation Mode"" of the ""Batman Arkham Series"" becomes important. By using ""Focus"", it becomes possible to visually recognize and visualize the enemies on the other side of the wall, which makes it easier for the player to aim for ""Steal Skill"" and grasp the total number of enemies. In addition, this ""focus"" is also very useful in battles with mechanical beasts. The weak points of the mechanical beast are set, and by using ""Focus"", the weak points of the mechanical beast are highlighted. As far as I played in the early stages, I felt that it would be more difficult for the mechanical beasts that appeared in the latter half to hit the weak points. As the game progresses, the ""player's skill"" goes up, so I got the impression that the difficulty level has been adjusted to the extent that it is not unreasonable. In addition to the above, you can set a trap to stun the enemy in the path of the enemy, and depending on the player, you can enjoy various battles in a slightly different way. There are many types of strategic battles and enemies, and new mechanical beasts and hostile tribes appear as the game progresses, making the battle side insatiable. There are many operability and actions as seen somewhere, but it can be said that there is a variety and variety. ◆ There are two ways to grow your character in this work, unlocking skills with ""Skill Tree"" and strengthening your character with ""Equipment"". Horizon uses an orthodox skill tree system, as seen in other works of the same type. You can get skill points by leveling up or clearing specific quests, and by allocating skill points to the skills you want to acquire, you can release useful skills that are useful for battle and exploration. It is possible. The skill tree is ""Hunter"": A skill tree where you can obtain many skills related to stealth battles. ""Yoshiyu"": A skill tree in which most of the skills related to normal combat are occupied. ""Knowledge"": A skill tree with abundant skills related to collecting items. ""Wandering"": Skill tree related to vehicles and item recycling. 4 types are available. It is up to the player from which tree to strengthen. By the way, experience points can be obtained in various ways, but I felt that it was possible to proceed with the main story without difficulty without forcibly raising the level. Of course, it depends on the difficulty level you choose. Weapons such as bows and slings, clothes, and modified items (so-called accessories-like items) that can be attached to the equipment slots of weapons and clothes are prepared for equipment. Since the equipment has a rarity, it is fun to collect and it has a little trehan-like fun. However, it is a pity that the equipment with high rarity is simply more powerful, and the equipment does not have random characteristics like the Hack and Slash series. ◆ There are few attractive sub-characters. Many characters lack charm because the stories of characters other than the main character are not deeply digged. Also, other than the main, rarely the main, the facial expressions of the characters do not change much during the conversation. Scenes that give the impression of having a conversation with a robot are scattered around. ◆ Due to the nature of the game, it is not possible to lock on the enemy, although it is not a bad point. You might think it would be strange to be able to lock on because it's a work that often uses a bow to defeat an enemy from a long distance, but that's not the case. This is because most enemies approach or ""hit"" the main character. It is difficult to operate after entering the melee, and the player's ""melee attack"" system is almost dead. ◆ Perhaps it is the fate of 3D works, the camera gets caught on the wall in some areas, and frustration accumulates. It doesn't happen often, but it doesn't happen when you're fighting an enemy. ◆ Many side-related quests are ""use-based"", and many are boring, such as neither good nor bad. ◆ ""Fellow NPCs"" will appear in certain quests and places, but they are very annoying when they come in between the enemy and die immediately when aiming at the enemy. It's just an obstacle. During play, ""Can you ignite this guy and feed it to a mechanical beast? How many times did you think? As an example, I gave a number of works in the review, but in reality, this work is finished as if it was a good point of many works. While many new and indie works are trying new things, this work is gracefully focused on how well ""existing trendy elements"" are incorporated and sublimated, and the content is wonderful. It's a method that only professionals on the road can do. Except for the newness in ""Video"", it's just the system that I saw in another work somewhere, but in terms of action, volume, play feel, ""Horizon Zero Dawn"" is exactly the royal road, AAA title It can be said that. Unless there was a problem related to ""forced termination"" mentioned above, there were some minor complaints, but I could not confirm any problems that would impair the game experience. It can be said that it is unlikely that you will miss playing. We have uploaded a play video, so if you are interested, please refer to this. ",False,False

That's fine if the art was interesting or emotionally moving, but although it deals with loaded subjects such as death and loss of loved ones, it's neither interesting nor emotionally moving. 3.5/10 Pros: + It's different. I'm in favor of more art experiences on Steam. The platform already has plenty of real games. + No fillers. The game is about as long as it should be for the experience that it aim to provide, which is just a few minutes.  Cons: - Nothing about the game is actually good. The idea, controls, graphics, sound are all poor and don't add up to anything that's worth your time. The music (a single song) is ok, but not as moving as it could be. - Instructions are misleading.  This game is not worth buying. I guess there's no harm in activating and spending a few minutes to ""play"" this game (or art experience) if you got it as a gift or via a bundle, but other than running without crashing it doesn't have any redeeming qualities. Skip it. ",False,False
"Brief comment: A good game ruined by the mechanism, the difficulty is very anti-human, all the mechanisms exist to oppose the player, the playing process is very uncomfortable. It is recommended that Warhammer or strategic turn-based enthusiasts can purchase it at their discretion when their history is low. This game has a more exquisite production level and sufficient content among the games authorized by GW. It is a pity that the game mechanics are anti-human. In the game, players must constantly collect dimension stones on the battle map to maintain their camp, and every battle arranges a hostile battle group to compete with the player. This should have added more fun to the game, but because of the essential difference between the player and the AI ​​goal, this setting is simply a nightmare. For players, because they need to develop their own battle groups and camps, the primary goal is to collect more dimension stones. As far as AI is concerned, they don't have a camp that needs to be maintained at all. All soldiers are sent, and their goal is only to destroy the player. This leads to a weird and ridiculous phenomenon. Every time the player hardly picks up any dimensional stone in the 3 or 4 rounds after the start, the AI ​​will attack you like a mad dog. At this time, if you still want to divide the troops to pick the dimension stone, it will probably lead to the defeat of the battle. Once the player concentrates his forces and will defeat the enemy at a considerable price, congratulations, you are one step closer to the collapse! Soldiers injured in the battle need dimension stones to recover, and camps need dimension stones to maintain. After you work hard to eliminate the enemy, the mission will be completed directly. Only 50% of all the unpicked dimensional stones on the map will be taken away by you. Fortunately, the result of a hard fight is only 50% of the profit! As mentioned earlier, if the AI ​​is a battle group with camps like the players, each victory of the player will weaken their strength. This setting is fair and the playability is also high. Unfortunately, every The AI ​​for a task is a brand new battle group that does not need to be operated, and it is so offensive. This leads to a very high probability of players entering a vicious circle of making ends meet and directly leading to the defeat of the battle. This ridiculous mechanism makes the game very difficult. Victory in battle will lead to defeat in battle, which is really weird. Advantages: rich in content, excellent modeling, very good for the restoration of background lore. Disadvantages: extremely difficult, ridiculous game mechanism ",False,False

"I am backer of this kickstarter games. This won't the same game i played during 1st demo. Even after final Demo that i played, this game felt so different and it is much harder to play and to harder to understand.  Lack of tutorials a very lazy developer and lack of hints or tip. Also no save game data. So you have start the game again from beginning whenever you quit. Also no difficulty settings such as the game is already on Hard level. I already have pass up to Scene 11 then i gave up because it got boring. No Story, No Cutscene. For $39,000 that much he the developer took! Very lazy game made by lazy Developer. Good luck to anyone who can get pass Scene 2 which freaking hard at the early stage of the game. And NO! I do NOT recommend this game! Do Not buy it at all even if it was free.

"The acting, graphics, dialogues are great compared to 2013. Seriously, it is nice that such games are coming to the computer platform, albeit late. But this game has one big downside, and that minus pulls the whole game down. For those who do not know, the game consists of parts. Each episode takes place in a different time of the main character. So you play the character as 20 years old in the first episode, and in the second part you play as 5 years old. This is what breaks the player from the game. Because while you are playing independent half-hour episodes, the character is constantly changing. So if I play the final episode as the first episode, you really wouldn't understand. This minus both seriously destabilizes the pace of the game and gives you ""What am I playing?"" gives the feeling. This problem will be very conspicuous that in the following years the option to play 'chronological' was added to the game. But that didn't save either. In short, it is not worth giving 63 TL.

"What a mess. I used to love the game, it was nice and refreshing from the FPS genre i'm used to playing. I played with my mates and we had a great time, simply having fun against the bots and online. But. this update, The marching fire update. has completley ruined that, forcing you to download 30GB to even play the game, to have all the content FROM that 30GB locked behind a highly priced DLC, 30 Euro, in my own currency thats 46.78 Australian for 30GB of content i was forced to download. I personally didn't go for the GOLD edition, which states you get ALL free upcoming DLC. But, not this huge content pack. people who purchased the gold edition will still need to throw more money to get what they already should have payed for.  They changed the difficulty of the bots, to where me and my friends can't even enjoy a relaxing game anymore.  they are incredibly strong, getting you stock in a vortex and not letting you have a single breath. spamming orange unblockable attacks, being incredibly aggressive with there attacks, every guard block you attempt will always be countered. this is for every bot now, unless your in a private match and have the bot at a level 1 difficulty. Finding a match is now basically impossible. I've waited up to 20+ min on a peek time, on a ""Very high activity"" mode. every day now, it seems that there is not a single person playing. its a shame, it's just a shame what Ubisoft have done to this game it used to be fun, but now its almost unplayable.

In the game, you can control both the mouse (this is in a platform game !!!) and the keyboard, and in some moments and both at the same time, couldn't you have done everything like in all other games, why the heck reinvent the wheel! it's just a two-button horror) There are also huge pixels, because of them, for example, you can't read some of the graffiti on the walls.

"Some absolutely garbage design decisions get a ""No"" from me.   The majority of negative reviews echo my own thoughts on this game, but there is one major bad decision that is the nail in the coffin. At the end of the main world 1, there is an escape sequence, where you have to escape a giant tree verticially which is filling up with water.  Which is about 4 minutes of extremely precise and difficult platforming, with no checkpoints.  You die and you have to do the entire thing over. What makes this particularly frustrating is that the ""platforming"" involves jumping ""off"" of moving projectiles.  Which move at a fairly speedy pace.  Miss once, start the whole section again. Apparently, there's two more of these such moronic sequences for each of the two later worlds.  Frustrating and unfun.  I did actually beat this section that I'm complaining about, but it's unforgivably terrible.  Not recommended. EDIT:  I just beat the game.  Yes, these annoying chase sequences still happen.  On the whole, the game was frustrating and not fun.  I persisted because the overall vibe of the game was good in terms of design and music, but overall I can't say my playthrough was a positive one.

"Paladins, a freebie version of Overwatch but with much more characters. Annoying thing? You gotta buy the champion pack with $$ or play tons of matches just to buy that one champion. While a freebie, it's still surprisingly fun with the biggest issue being it's matchmaking. PROS - Wide variety of heroes to keep the player interested, assuming you don't mind it's balancing problems. - Certain skins can be obtained for free - The game runs smoothly, however an unexpected crash may happen from time to time. - Auto-purchase towards passives you can obtain in each game, based on how well you do. So if ur on the losing side, expect to stay on the losing side as making a come back is more difficult. CONS - Matchmaking is the worst I've seen from any competitive game - Only a small number of maps between the 3 game modes. - The game is imbalanced in terms of certain heroes. One such example is there is a champion who almost has an execute for any champions below 30% hp. Yes that includes tanks as well. - For a competitive game, I've yet to come across a player who wants to talk in game... - If a player leaves, they are replaced by a bot who aims and plays like an Easy AI. Note you don't get warned when a player leaves. - Disconnections can randomly happen and you are stuck in an infinite loading screen unless you crash the game with task manager.  Matchmaking I've put as a Con, I'll give you a quick rundown on how bad it can get, rather suddenly as well. First couple of weeks of playing the game I decided to main Ying while trying out a few I can buy with gold. Few days a go I was on a surprisingly high 86% win rate. After that I've been on a losing streak for the past 50 games now. which has me down to 31% win rate now, in only a week. If non-ranked games are like this, I'll assume it's much worse for ranked. If this isn't a game you want to play competitively then this section of the review shouldn't bother you. Overall The game is fun, just the real question being do you really care about a game's balancing? Would the matchmaking bother you if you went on a rather absurd losing streak? If both answers are no then deffo give the game a shot. ",False,False

I love the fact that you have to teach them how to do things but a couple of new characters that only raise the difficulity of the game aren't worth the full prize of the DLC.

"""Timberman: All the fun of working in the firewood business without any of that boring getting paid for your labour or getting a reasonable price for your precious commodity crap to get in the way of the excitement of being a rejected character from a mildly amusing and slightly trans-phobic Monty Python sketch minus the catchy tune to distract you. Sounds like a solid concept to me, the promise of hours of fun! Gee, I can hardly contain myself! Can you?""  When I was a child, as the eldest son chopping and bringing in the firewood was a chore I was assigned during the winter months. So believe me when I say I know that chopping wood is fundamentally chore-like. There's a reason why my Dad insisted that I take on this responsibility as soon as I was old enough to swing an axe. It is a tedious and thankless task which nobody in their right mind would volunteer to do. So as you might understand playing this game is extremely chore like. I would be remiss if I did not mention that 8-player multiplayer is really quite fun when none of your opponents are cheating. This does not happen that often, but does happen as have I asked one guy how he was able to chop wood so fast and he said he used autofire on his controller :( And when played on a computer then it's nowhere near as good as when you play it on android. So take my advice and get the Android version instead. 3.3/10 Extremely competitive 2-8 player online multiplayer saves this from being no fun at all. But not from complete and total mediocrity. Oh and the short music loop really gets on my pecs after about 4 repetitions. And if you can't think of something better to do with your hands than play this then you are seriously lacking in imagination.

"84% of positive reviews. Another Assassin's Creed with an attempt to jump over your head. Beautiful world, good graphics, disgusting combat and boring plot. Another cliche in the form of revenge (is not bethesda in the developers?). We go to the goal throughout the game, removing every little thing, and in the last 30-60 minutes we kill historical figures at the level of Caesar. I spent about 30 hours on the passage. 28 of them went through all the locations gradually, completing every question and every quest. But after that I was already very tired (i.e. count dropped) and I decided to go only according to the plot, which also turned out to be tightened in the end (just what is the search for the villain-target for revenge: you jump 2300 meters, talk 2 times and watch a couple vidosikov, then you jump for another 3 km and again talk and watch vidosikov, and already there, at a distance of 600 m, find the target). If you briefly describe the gameplay - you jump to the questionnaire, kill / find / climb people / objects / on the tower and that's it. Monotony is a complete description 90% of the time. Quests ala the witcher 3? Only a pathetic attempt. This isn't the first time Ubisoft has proven that they can enter an interesting and beautiful world, but everything else is mediocre.

"Let's examine his game as one of my friend, who was thrown into the steam market with a price of 6 TL with the ""Turkish Game"" tag: First of all, I am neither a game producer nor someone who works on it. I should state this first of all, ""If you did better then"". I will not be exposed to reaction. At first glance, our game is reminiscent of the games played on the internet sites in our childhood. I can say that it will not grin if we put it in Kraloyun or something. When we enter the game, we see two modes. There must be a STORY. 2-3 sentences written at the beginning does not make that mode ""Story mode"". In my opinion, so little effort has been spent on the game that there is already 1 map in the game, in the story mode, accidentally painting the same map in different colors and even bothering like the 1st episode 2nd episode. not visited. 1 map was made, mushrooms were sprinkled with 5 different colors randomly, we also collect all the mapi like mad calf and collect those mushrooms and combine them with the 1,2,3,4,5 keys and make it a kind of magic, combo or whatever we are doing now. we have been asked to kill ghouls. (Even if the keys are them, I think I will run with the keys w, a, s, d or press the numbers?) There are also 3-4 features other than mushrooms on the map, the most crucial of which is the unlimited mushroom that I know thanks to my friend. a feature. Thanks to this, they put 2-3 on the map, all of them squeezed in the cemetery-like place in the middle. In fact, you may say why you were so stuck and you wouldn't have entered again, but I do not want to delete and shelve the game I started without fulling its achievements. I wanted to finish this game as soon as possible and lift the pole. But thanks to them, they made such an absurd success that you can reach 10,000 points, finish the game in a difficult, normal, easy mode, 500 mushroom ball ... Because of these, the game is not a game and turns into a running simulator. You collect mushrooms like calves one by one on the map, again, if you memorize the features while making 10,000 points, you can only complete 50 rounds, 200 points each round. Frankly, I do not think that even the person who made the game will endure or fold this infamous thing that much. The last thing I need to draw attention to is that when we enter the store page of the game, the game received a ""positive"" note. Although there are 10-15 reviews in total, but here is also very valid in our country, dude, friendly relationship is sitting on the table. You look at the reviews because ""my friend made it. I was kind of boosted with comments such as ""and"" let's support the Turkish game. "" I only complain that someone of my own race uses his Turkish identity as an idiot and puts this product on the market for 6 TL. 6 TL may not be a big fee, but believe me, even 60 kurus is more for this game. If we want the Turkish game industry to develop, let's put forward products with more potential. If the person who does it is with our friend, let's know how to say bad.

The fighting is clunky (took me 3 minutes to kill 2 guards because no hits were landing, despite the fact I was basically standing inside their hitbox) and the game mechanics are there but aren't explained.

"I mentioned this game with my friend today, and I want to write something. As a player who has played for 700 hours, I do not recommend this game. This game has fallen into a loop with the player, a cycle of evil. A long time ago, when the game only had 3 weapons. At that time, the games were basically well received. Until a player created something like a ""stick"". The stick is basically a long strip body, the propeller is wrapped around the body, and the gun frame is extended from the gaps around. Several advantages of the first-generation stick are as follows: First: extremely mobile. It can even be described as a ghost animal, and because of the surrounding propellers and the limitations of weapons at that time, it is difficult for opponents to effectively attack their mobility. Second: The blood volume is extremely thick. Because the HP of the thruster was very high at the beginning, most machine guns and even magnetic track players would have trouble getting rid of this thing quickly even if they shot accurately. I don't need to mention the anti-air capability of plasma grenade. Fortunately, or unfortunately, the production team quickly noticed this thing. At this point, the evil cycle started to weaken the stick. The production team did everything possible. The most obvious are the following two points: 1: Weakening the blood volume of the thruster, used to weaken the overall flesh of the stick 2: The design is easier and more powerful Powerful ""air defense"" weapons (anti-aircraft guns and tracking missiles) have policies and countermeasures, and stick players soon began to improve the game. A new type of stick with a triangular block as the main body has appeared. The blessing of damage guidance technology has become another generation of sky tyrants (du) (liu). I don't know what the interested players have discovered. By the way, planes are lying down in this era! Many players who spend a lot of thought on the air force, using thrusters and wings as maneuvering, can be said to be directly GG. They are directly beaten by the above two weapons, crying father and mother, and the culprit stick is still behind the player crazy output There are still many grievances about vehicles and production teams. I don’t want to go into details. I want to talk about another reason for my abandonment: the atmosphere of domestic players. I have stayed in a domestic QQ group for several years. I can tell directly. You, these players even use the stick as a core technology to study. They think that playing with sticks is a great player, and even professional stick players can be group administrators. He said that sticks are not cancerous, and sticks are not cancerous. They laugh at the incompetence of the production team. Can't really hit the stick, while improving the stick or even forming a stick team for the game. I have formed a team with this stick group management player. In that match, I played a lot of damage and was the first in the team. But domestic players also knew that the rc server often caused players to disconnect. Unfortunately, I was The call was dropped halfway through. I posted a screenshot of the record to the group, wanting to tell this player that I’m sorry for being dropped, I’ve tried my best. At this time, something very interesting happened. This guy suddenly involuntarily accused me of what the so-called ""delay man"" is. , Which means that he feels that my damage is imaginary, and it is completely dependent on hitting the enemy while delaying and not being able to fight back. When I was arguing with him, I found out that all the other people in the group helped him talk to him except for the theater. Because he is an authority, and I am an anonymous player. Hehe, I don't think I need to say more. To sum up, this is indeed a game that the production team is working hard. It is a pity that the chaos of this game is caused by the players for various reasons, and they are still ruling this game. I don’t recommend you to contact this game now. ",False,False

"An OK adventure game that could've been great if they simply removed the entire story and dialogue.   Level design, puzzles, graphics, sound fx, etc. are all top notch.  As it is you'll be eye-rolling your way to the finish.  Neither recommeded nor not recommended, Steam's idiotic review system makes you choose one or the other though. ",False,False
"1. This is a good game to be commended. But not as much as she is praised. Reaching the end is a real willful test. According to steam statistics, only 7% of the starting players of the classic version and 9.8% of the EE version mastered the final. Relative indicator, but still. The game, in my opinion, weakly keeps near itself and closer to the middle of the passage tends to drop. 2. The review is mostly about high complexity. I think the low difficulties are really fun throughout the game. Of course, DOS is passable in many ways, but the problem of complexity is not always the curvature of the player's hands. Tactical and Heroic modes are distinguished by reduced vitality and accuracy for your heroes and increased ones for enemies. Also, there are more enemies in the parties, and the arsenal of their spells is much wider. In the first third of the game, this is an interesting challenge; try to use all the tactical advantages - surfaces, bombs, arrows, skills, squad position, elemental synergies, barrels. A lot of tactics, which is great. What you need from the game. But over time, the number of fights grows, the enemies grow stronger and fatter, and the impression of the variety goes away. On the contrary, the action window is narrowed, and each battle turns into a tedious and lengthy simulator of loading and saving according to the same scheme, and small conventions artificially prolong the already monotonous gameplay. It doesn't matter who is in front of the heroes - the king of trolls or the bum from the ditch - if the enemy moves first, consider that you have no chance in most cases. On the very first turn, you will be blinded / frozen / petrified / knocked down / turned over to your side / knocked down / frightened / just plugged with anything. That's where the variety is! In short, you will immediately lose control of the character for at least 1 turn. This is enough to say goodbye to him. Defending skills on these difficulties won't help much. Here's how ""the cube will fall."" A high initiative or save-load will save you until you miss. Happened? Then let's move on to tactics. The battles themselves are essentially the same from the first skeleton to the penultimate battle (the final battle is a separate song). And the abuse of secrecy was transferred to the extended edition, not feeling much of the amendments. Castanul - hid - survived - stabbed in the back - missed - loaded. My assassin cut out everything that is possible in a solo, any part and without the means at hand. The difference was in the duration of the battles, tk. the chance of misses is great. With a success rate of 86%, approximately every second hit will smear. Killing some Boreus for 20 minutes is not fun or interesting at all. The number of downloads decides everything. By the way, the player himself can easily miss the enemy with the mouse, sending the character anywhere. At the same time, the development of the character as you progress is not felt at all; there is no sign that the hero is getting stronger. The increase in characteristics affects a few percent, and it turns out that the first battles are about as stifling as the last. A huge number of talents (once every 3 levels) just for show and will not be required by any class. The heroes seem to be made of glass (both were a ""lone wolf"" with increased HP, an assassin and a two-handed man) and fall apart with any armor. And the armor does not differ significantly from each other; it's more about taste than their bonuses. However, you devote a lot of time to them, digging through the clogged inventory and comparing with each other. Things wear out and break - part of the gameplay. But there is nothing but lengthening of fights in this element. You miss a blow for the sake of repairing, but the thing is repaired - even if by a hero who is out of combat and on the other end of the map, and it is repaired instantly. Then why is the strength parameter here at all? A huge number of things a la Skyrim have been introduced into the game; carry buckets of water with you, take cups, tubs and washboards from the shelves, but they are not really used. Sell ​​- so money has nowhere to go if you loot; to craft something - why? There are many recipes, but nothing is needed; found things will be quite satisfying. Even for a team of 4 heroes, there is always the right thing, at least from a merchant. The plot deflates to half the game. Didn't miss anything, skipping most of the dialogues. But this is not for everyone, there will still be small twists. The system of moral choice urges the player to make a choice not always as he wants to do, but depending on what bonus this choice gives. For example, you will have to kill someone whom you wanted to spare, just for the sake of the desired bonus for the character. Nothing personal. Usually, such karma affects the ending or the attitude of others, but here you can nobly save the world, being downright immoral bastards. In conclusion, I repeat that the game is not bad overall. But incredibly protracted. The negative effects of high difficulties do not bring anything interesting, do not give a pleasant feeling of overcoming a worthy challenge, but only delay the passage for long, long days.

"Warning! This game is super fun, But do not, I repeat do not invest in War Thunder.  It's a very expensive, very miss-managed game. Servers are poorly run, they are unballanced, and have no admins to rid them of hackers and trolls and stat padders ( or should i say LION padders).  Trying to progress thru the game is made nearly impossible without spending alot of money, and getting only a little for it. You are constantly forced to pay overpriced amounts to re train the same crews. while you try to upgrade your lvl-1 or-2 or-3 or-4 planes you are constantly thrown into higher lvl servers, its very unballanced.

Hair is a separate topic altogether, so that you understand, they are here like people from LEGO. The same problems with voice acting, in Russian localization the voice does not fall on the lips. Huh, just before my very eyes, a person disappeared in general in the theater ... The drawing of shadows is terrible, a couple of meters from the character the shadows are already blurring, and they really SPREAD, just into a puddle vertically ..

"Now... I guess the best thing I can say about Prospekt is that its concept is well executed, and that there is at least a portion of the game that really ties in with the Half-Life 2 spirit... BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUT 1) The game is too hard, even on normal. I couldn't count how many times I double-barrel shot a combine in the head TWICE before he had to die... 2) The level design, is ludicrous. You are being pitched against waves of combine after every door and elevator with NO WAY TO HIDE. 3) The voice-overs, although high in quality, sound too amateur to be convincing and disconnect the original Half-Life spirit from Prospekt. 4) Buttons, buttons and buttons. 5) The story, which each time triggers an incredibly annoying effect as you recall flashbacks from the past, is underdeveloped, but it's not the main part of the game as it focusses heavily on combat, just don't expect a satisfying tale that will move or motivate you in any significant way. The ending is mediocre and almost a carbon copy of the beginning if you look at it from a distance. I have to say I really welcome and applaud the additional combine machinery design that can be found across the levels, and the smart use of the cubemaps. My favorite level was the teleport level, even though it just repeated the same button idea all over again. Soundtrack is excellent, one of the closest things that could absolutely fit in an original Half-Life game, as much as the actual sound design. I would rate this game a 6/10. Just don't forget that after all, this was made by one person, it's just sad that that really shows in the game. ",False,False
"I played a lot of HOGs already and not only games from Artifex Mundy but other studios as well. This one is by far the worst I played so far.

The plot isn't bad but so lame ""visit psychiatrist - you need books to impress her (HOG) - enter her office - you need to look for cards (HOG) - she says 2 sentences - I need tea (HOG) - she say one sentence - I need pills (minigame) - she say two sentences - I need positive energy (HOG)"" and so on..

As let players disappointed in this game time and time again, hope that survival can usher in its second spring, and also hope that Dawn can manage the advantages of this game. 1. Optimization is okay. After all, the game is 2 years old. 2. The new version is more like Survival of zombies and wild animals are no longer furnishings 3. It is strongly recommended that the new version of the building system has a high degree of freedom and building skins :) Disadvantages 1. Plug-ins have always been a big problem for survival and the dawn company now seems Basically ignore it 2. There are many bugs and even some bugs that have existed 2 years ago and have not been fixed yet. 3. The new version now only releases part of the map. The limitations are very large. When the new version first opened, the highest peak was 5000+ and now again It fell to around 2000. Many friends lost interest in the game after pve built their home. ",False,True
"I rarely write reviews, so I generally know how to write correctly, well, let's start ... I will say that the game does not cost 300 rubles as max. it costs like any indie toy, especially for android it is free. So if you buy it, it's better at a discount. Plot: and yes he is here, not to say that he is some kind of cliché, well, supposedly you are guilty of the death of my family, and therefore I will kill you, and yes that's all. But still for an indie game it's something, but not for me, so the plot is a minus of the game. Grapooooon: and yes it is good for a unit, it certainly doesn’t look so cool on the ultras, but still it’s good, in short, grapooooon is a plus. Duration: well, for my first playthrough, I was able to make up for 6 hours (well, because I didn't know what and how p.s. youtube to help), and if I hadn't been stupid, I would have passed max. for 2 hours, but again an indie game, so the duration is both plus and minus. Gameplay: all you can do is eat donuts, run for 6 seconds. , and sitting in the closet is what we do most of the game, but here there are, let's say, puzzles - which are not complicated, but let's say incomprehensible, I found out about the key card in the bathroom only thanks to YouTube, and on android they gave me a game norms. hint, like look in the bathroom, so gameplay is a minus. AI: but here everything is more interesting, I still did not understand how the owl teleports, if it is clearly said that he made them himself and did not endow the magic of teleportation, but about others it is clear, you run around - the cat will jump out of ventilation, and even in this position as if it was pumped in crysis 2 or 3, the wolf is the most common thing that is heart-warming in all respects, like Chris Walker, AI is a plus and a minus. Bottom line: 4 minuses and 3 pluses, in general, the game is not worthy of being incentivized, but only in play markete, where it belongs, so I will advise this game to anyone, but perhaps only to those who love and adore FNAF, and so to no one, generally 3 out of 10 ",False,False

"As much as I loved this game, I cannot recommend it as it is right now. The amount of glitches and bugs make this game almost unplayable. I could go on with specific examples such as many side quests, that are simply most of time frozen and you are stuck at the objective, which exists on the map but not in the world for some reason, like the bees and honey quest, which was mentioned on several forums since 2017 and nobody bothered to fix it. Motigene Gives You Wings freezes the character and you are unable to talk to him to complete the quest. Superb Meat Boy quest breaks through the last cutscene and therefore you are unable to complete it. You can even accidently fail a quest as you get attacked by people or characters are stuck inside the walls. Not mentioning the worst and most frustrating glitch I experienced half way through the first Act - save option being disabled. No matter what I did, restarting the game, killing myself/restarting the level, taking and completing quests, moving from one district to another, entering buildings etc the game did NOT allow me to manually save the progress. It did fortunatelly autosaved after completing the quests, but when I tried to exit the game, the message popped up saying that the game cannot be saved because the character is busy or something like that. Overall performance issues, unstable FPS, many technical problems, blurred textures, invisible obstacles, frozen animations, broken quests and game breaking issues. Sometimes the cutscene ends but the game doesn't detect it and you are stuck in the letterbox view with and not being able to move. It's a real shame, because the game has a big potential, great creepy atmosphere and beautiful detailed sceneries. If you like Fallout, Bioshock, Bendy and Ink Machine sort of games, you would love this game for sure!

"Assassin's Creed Unity can be said to be the main reason why the name of the series was tarnished. The PC port is disgustingly bad.

"If you like achievements, good news for you, only 6 (frustratingly dumb) levels, you can get all the achievements in as little as a few minutes!  The developer clearly does not care about video games, he just wants to make a quick buck.   These are assets found off of the Unity store, by two different makers, and the game is in Unity, what more do I need to say about this? The game consists of 3 sounds and one music track, that's all there is, so if you came for spectacular music, leave. And did I mention that they're using royalty free music and sounds? Amazingly, the game takes only a few minutes to complete (*shocker*), so if you want to obtain all 4999 (notice I didn't say 5000) achievements, it'll only take you a few minutes to do so. He's not trying to hide the fact that it's barebones or an asset flip, so sad to see gaming consisting of titles like this. What's even more sad is that he actually hard-advertises one of his game, you stare at the poster of his game and you win. That's it. Also, about the last achievement, you can't get it.

"This game hooked me with its idea that you will be in the role of the mayor of the city and wake up not only to build buildings like in a city-planning simulator, but also to solve the issues and problems of the city. This game has it, but it is not fully implemented. Now let's take a closer look at the mechanics and visual part of the game: - here it is bright, but soapy. The models are all poorly drawn, although I had a high level of graphics in the settings. What I liked was the building models, although not very detailed, but beautifully detailed. - I can't say anything. Some people write that the game is not optimized, while others have it. I think it no longer depends on the game, but on the computer, since everything is going perfectly for me. - I would also like to note that the streets of your city will be practically empty, because when you zoom in to the closest distance, a maximum of 5-10 townspeople and 3-8 carriages will appear on the screen. The models are also poorly detailed, the animation of movement is clumsy, and besides, they tend to pass through each other. - the game has little, so after a while of the game you start to get bored of doing the same thing. For example, the game has such functions as decrees, taxes, financing, construction of a district (selection of territory for construction of buildings such as: industry, commerce, housing) and the construction of special buildings (Theater, police, etc.). And for all this, it is still necessary that the city parties vote, which you can also beg, demand and threaten, so that they vote for your proposals. But even here there are identical replicas. And everything comes to the point that all this is repeated round and round and there is no variety. - Also, what angered me the most, in this case on the Russian interface of the game, the text, that is, the description of certain functions, is very small, which is very inconvenient. The game has just appeared, and it was only created by a campaign of game makers, which is why I want to say that the game came out for the first time with dignity, but it needs to be finalized, otherwise it will be forgotten after a while. For example, add new functions in city management. I really liked the idea itself and I hope that the game will not be abandoned and will work on it. I don't think it's worth buying the game yet, and wait for further development or buy it to support the developers. Better to watch the video on YouTube. ",False,False

"You know what I was just thinking about a couple of days before I received this game in Curator Connect? ""I haven't heard from BMC Studios in a while... maybe the developer finally got the hint that I actually really hate his 'games'. Maybe he finally realized that I don't like him as a person through what he's portrayed with his 'games'. Thank god I haven't had to suffer through that trash in a long time"". Aaaaaaaaaand here we are. True story. It's like he read my mind and decided he hadn't sent me any spam keys in a while. I think what he does to me is part of the meme culture he embraces so much. I think he actually likes hearing from me. In case you haven't noticed, I loathe BMC Studios and we have a history that dates pretty far back... to their first release actually, when there actually was a ""their"" and not just a ""he"". So yeah, after his friends left the ""company"" this guy dropped out of college to pursue making this kind of garbage. The kind of elementary school trash that makes fun of people, but he tries to cover it up by acting like it's an ""accurate portrayal"" or some crap. If you need an idea, look at Coughing Simulator 2020. Gotta live that dank meme culture amirite. So, Not Well, it's supposed to be an interactive short film depicting someone who is severely depressed. Like everything else BMC Studios does, it's badly done in both context and execution. It's 20 minutes long, and you get to watch a guy sit at his computer and pathetically attempt to tear up his desk, chair, and phone without actually succeeding, then you get to watch him shower, then you get to watch him shave. Somewhere in there he pees and finds a hidden present. That's it. That is literally all this is, with a total of 3 interactions that let you ""keep your depression inside"" or ""express it"". Oh, and these options aren't even coded correctly... at least one of the ""express it"" scenes takes you to the ""keep it in"" scene. You had to code 3 things BMC Studios, three things. Let's move on to the film portion. In high school, I was taught about how long scenes were supposed to last, the rule of thirds, good transitional sequences, use of angles, etc. Either BMC Studios never took a film course in his life, or he just doesn't care. Seeing as you could teach yourself most of the aforementioned with some YouTube tutorials these days, I'm going to go with he just doesn't care to make anything that has any semblance of quality or value. With the exception of looking at him laying down in the tub all of the angles are straight on, and there are no transitions. There's nothing but stagnant 5+ minute long shots constantly. So unless you like to watch a guy shower, shave, pee, and sit at his computer then you're not going to have anything that even remotely resembles a good time here. It should also be mentioned that there's incontinuity regarding the tablet that's received as a gift later on. It's on the desk at the start of the ""game"". And the worst part of it all? This inaccurate depiction of depression that's only going to further the stigma that mental illness is only for crazy people and that depression always leads to self-harm. Not sure what he was going for here, the Curator Connect offer came with a note that mentioned something about how he felt when he was 15 and his dad died and he went through a short depression afterwards. However, as someone who has experienced extreme depression for most of their life, I can't say I've ever stared in the mirror and twitched around like a lunatic. Nor have I ravenously tore at my skin, and I especially didn't creepily kiss it after the fact. I've destroyed things in fits of depression-fueled rage, but we already went over how that wasn't executed properly. I mean, you could've at least gotten up and straight up destroyed something, but that would've required effort and energy. Everyone expresses their grief and depression differently, but overall Not Well doesn't depict any part of depression accurately; not its physical properties, its mental state, or even mental manifestations. It simply endorses the stigmas around depression, and that's why I think this is yet another meme culture poop smear on the Steam catalogue. Look man. I didn't like Kimulator, and I hate Not Well. I am a horror curator, and your ""games"" do not fit my demographic. You might find more people who actually like your work if you spend time sending your keys to appropriate curators. I've gone through this gradual progression of absolute scorn when it comes to BMC Studios, and it's at the point now where the next review will be the absolute bare minimum and a downvote. Go get an education for coding and film if this is what you want to do with your life, you will find it to be a benefit. At the very least, watch some tips or guides on how to make your content at least somewhat engaging. If you meant this release to be sincere, you need to work on your sincerity.

Microtransactions are unnecessary due to the sheer amount of sales that this game has, but are fine anyway as long as they do not affect gameplay.

"Hello everyone, hello everyone. Today I will take a look at a piece of ebony govn - CS: GO! (I made a review from nexy, but objectively) Chapter 1. Pricing Hello Valve? what the hell did you make the game free? This begs the question - did I buy it for 400+ shekels? Oh yes, for the sake of the finished medal, which did not give up to me. Its main advantage is that it distinguishes normal people from cheaters. Well, how would Gabenu say that the prime, which costs 1k, can be received by every cheater ... Chapter 2. Pros and cons of the game. Pros: 1. The game is good if you don't play it, 2. Adequate teammate. More details here. Since ks has become free (useless prime does not count), there is an active increase in stupid schoolchildren, who are distinguished from normal people by one extra chromosome. But still, there are old players. Olds are in place, but there are very few of them in this dump. Shank to meet them is 1: 5. 3. Modes. Competitive, survival, normal, arms race and other slag. On individual community servers, you can find other modes, for example, prison, banihop, team battle, single mission. That's all. Naturally there are more cons. So, the cons: 1. Graphics. For 2012, the graphics are so-so. For example, compare the graphics of CS: GO and the graphics of Battlefield 2, which was released 2 years earlier - in 2010. Although the graphics do not hurt the eyes, it could have been better. 2. Community. Basically, these are schoolchildren from 5 to 15 years old who yell into the microphone, post your mother and take her to the cinema. Don't even try to argue with them - the kick is guaranteed. I don’t count the Poles and foreigners, because I don’t mention Russian words (in particular vodka, Russia, bear and balalaika) in my speech, then everything will be decided on a peaceful note. 3. Well, in fact, the main biological waste of the game is cheaters. Wak works xy knows how, they fuck him. The main thing for them is to self-judge in front of their fellow cockerels how oxy and cool they are. 4. Artificial increase in rank (boost). Some players, for various reasons, use the services of increasing their rank for money from more professional players. This leads to rather sad consequences, because when a player gets such a high rank and starts playing, his benefit in the team is zero. They automatically become days. 5. The presence of bugs. Despite the fact that the game was born in 2012, there are still bugs waiting to be resolved. The factor is not critical, but rather annoying in a tense game, when any little thing can radically change the balance of power on a particular map. Especially the jaded Nvidia shaders that make the smoke invisible. Chapter 3. Conclusion. Subtotal: - CS GO is when skins on weapons are more expensive than cool gaming devices. - CS GO is when you open 20 cases and get 20 pieces of blue govna. - CS GO is when a schoolboy adds you and starts begging for a gift worth 3500 rubles, giving the argument ""you're rich, what is it worth!"" - CS GO is when you are sent links to Trojans 10 times a day in the hope of cleaning up your inventory. - CS GO is when you are kicked out just because you are Russian. - CS GO is when ""globals"" create 10 accounts each and get satisfaction playing against ""Kalash"". - CS GO is when you learned Polish in one or two skating rinks. - CS GO is when there are more Poles in the competitive mode than in Poland itself. - CS GO is when your advice and questions are answered by ""stfu Russian"". - CS GO is when every third teammate is a boosted silver. - CS GO is when you land all 30 rounds in one and apply 99 in 7, and that one hits you in the head with a random shot. - CS GO is when VAC exponentially bans professional players, but cannot ban a, which shoots the entire team through three walls, while having 2.2 hours in the game.

Perhaps the tried-and-true Pro's and Con's list is the way to go.  Then we'll see where we land. So first, the positives: The art is pretty.  The backgrounds are vibrant and colorful.  The sprites themselves are beautiful, and the women are certainly attractive.  CGs are plentiful - especially given the length of the game.  There's obvious care and effort put into the artwork, but is that really enough? If you like Yuri, that's basically the whole plot.  Pumpkin is in love with her boss and wants to sleep with her.  That's essentially it.  I mean, there are some minor details in how we get to that point, but let's be honest; once you realize that's the objective, that's all most of us (guys) will care about.  Let's make it happen! On the negative, the story is insanely short. I was able to complete all the achievements in a little over an hour.  I'm a fast reader, but even still.  Many of them are for random choices in the middle of the game, so in essence there are actually only 4, or perhaps 5, endings. And one of those can be reached in 5-10 minutes. The translation is . . . wonky.  It's certainly not the worst I've ever played/read, but the grammar, verb tense, etc. is all over the place.  Now, I've had games with horrible english be almost a positive for me (check out my review for  ). But this is in that gray area.  It's bad enough that it's distracting to me, but not so far off that it's adorable.  If you're reading this VN in Russian, this obviously won't apply to you. In the end, I feel as though the playtime and general blandness of the story are enough to have me tell you to hold off on this one.  At $4, I'm not sure it's worth the money.  In a bundle, on a 75% sale, or received as a gift? Absolutely worth a playthrough.  But just the once when you have an hour or so to kill.  And you want to see green and purple nakedness. P.S. In the game, hit TAB then type the word 'code' to unlock the nudity options.  It's not exactly vital or game changing, but I mean . . . boobs . . . so . . . yeah. Might as well look at them.

"It all started out great: The game seemed solid and one of the least unworthy Call of Duty of the decade. In fact, the universe, art design, weapons, and mobility are fantastic to the point that if it weren't weighed down by issues that make it impossible to enjoy, it would be after MW and MW2 in terms of quality. Once you have spent a few hours in the multiplayer (almost level 50 already) you will realize what is wrong. To begin with, the game has a mouse acceleration that, at least for me, makes it impossible for me to aim as I have always aimed in Call of Duty. I've been forced to turn the mouse down to 125hz and enter a registry entry that supposedly overrides any possible mouse acceleration in Windows, and even then, it's still pretty noticeable. Add lag compensation (the worst I have seen to date) and that in absolutely ALL the games played, all the players except the hoster have had the ping constantly going up and down, to the point that practically nothing of what happens, is happening in real time or is it true. I have finished 0 - 19 in some games, and I have been giving the shooter theme for more than ten years. Most of the time your bullets do not hit the enemy, even if you are aiming at the body and clearly you should be hitting, instead he kills you in a hundredth of a second without you even having time to react. The other half of the time you get the indicator that your bullets are hitting him, but in the end you die again, even if you started shooting before him, then you see in the killcam, that he was shooting you long before he did. appeared on your screen. The typical melee duel is very common, and you will hear how your knife hits first, but in the end you die and not him. The fact is that nothing that happens in the games is real. Skill has no place, only luck. It's a real lottery, and the whole experience is tainted. I had never had a negative KDR until Advanced Warfare. To all this add several bugs of interaction with the stage that will kill you instead of saving you (like the character not hooking to a curb) and some control problems that will leave you completely sold out when you least expect it (the double-tap to do dodge that cannot be deactivated) by canceling your refills and leaving your ass on a silver platter. I must say that it has been the most frustrating and insulting online experience I have had in many years. How can a shooter that boasts of having competitive multiplayer use P2P systems and lag compensation in PC in the middle of 2014? It is something that I find directly offensive to the consumer and PC gamer. I have decided to park the game (or at least try, despite the wall of problems above, the game is addictive) until they fix the current netcode, remove (or give the option) mouse acceleration and double-tap e enter the supposed dedicated servers that you DO NOT have and that you SHOULD have as promised by them. Also note that it has the most expensive season pass ever, and the zombies mode is only available if you buy it. Exclusive maps and other ""premium"" junk for those who stick around after Activision hit them well from behind. I got dressed and went out the window. If anyone was waiting for opinions on the campaign, I have only played 3 chapters, but the little I have seen so far has seemed wonderful even if I am a minor. The curiosity of new technologies and the power of Atlas (the power of Kevin Space and his character, rather. It is magnetic even in a video game.) These are two very powerful reasons to go ahead and find out what will happen. The main character, Mitchell, looks like the typical puppet moved by the strings of the powerful without having a fucking idea of ​​anything. Topical and uninteresting, although it works as an avatar. If you put the batteries and fix the problems of the game with four patches (you don't really need more), I'll change the analysis to positive. For me it is still a Mercedes with flat tires.

"The game doesn't have much going for it. It sounded kinda interesting at first, but you quickly realize there is zero depth to the game. Leveling up in mining, for example, just yields more types of rocks you can mine, but doesn't improve the gameplay in any meaningful way. The monsters are pretty basic. Skills have long cooldowns and there isn't a terrible variety of skills you can use. Most skills just buff damage or something like that. The game is caught in a hard place, on the one hand, it wants to be a free form game, and on the other, it uses a silly level based tiering system. The two don't mix very well. Combat is boring, the gathering is boring, and the game feels like a long chore. I can't recommend. ",False,False

"Fall-to-your-death simulator with some nice hellish scenery... until even the scenery gets boring.  The controls feel stiff and weird, I had to up my mouse sensitivity as there were no sensitivity options in the controls menu, but even then, if I want to entertain myself by falling to my death I'd do it in Mario 64 or something where at least I get a good Italian plumber wail of panic.

"This game looks fun until you play it. Its a repetitive shell of a game that looks promising. I wish I could give this a thumbs up and recommend it but I can't. And here's why...                                                                                *The Good* * Spaceship customization. It's pretty fun to build and come up with different type of spaceships for mining, or killing an enemy. but it does get confusing because it doesn't hold your hand and explain everything. * Graphics and Frame rate. The Graphics are sharp and clean even the colors and how the neon lights of your ship glow as well as the particle effects. Frame rate does not take a hit at all. which I'm impressed especially if you build a giant monster ship or something. * Rogue like game play. I enjoy Roguelite games so the random loot for completing a mission is a plus.                                                                                       *The Bad* * Same 3 types of enemies. Ones that float and follow you, Shoot and chase you. Or stationary ones that shoot up in the sky like anti air. * Planets. I really hoped that this would have made the game but it doesn't all the planets are empty. there's some enemies on each planet but they feel hollow and I think it feels this way because of the missions. ( I'll explain this more below.) * The missions. What were they thinking? These missions are the same every time. Retrieve an item (Freezer Or ships blackbox) Kill or destroy Something. ( Corp transmitter, Hive, Overheating or pirate mines.)  Explore an area/planet. These should help each planet feel different but they don't. It just feels like you're doing the same thing every time you go to a solar system. * The soundtrack! Why did you guys choose those tracks? They sound grim and you'll hear the same track like 5 times in a row. This game should have an action/ creativity inspired track. *  If you put too many items on one part of your ship it'll wig out and start spazzing out so hard that literal parts of your ship will blow up. Not sure if this is a feature or glitch either way this is pretty lame considering that this game is about letting your imagination run wild.                                                                *Conclusion* This game would be good if it was still in Early access and if it was 10$ But I can't justify the 20.00$ Price point. You'll get a couple hours of fun out of this game but I can't see getting hundreds out of it. The game feels empty and repetitive. Even with the creative mode you'll get bored fast because there aren't that many scenarios to use your ship on. I'd rate this a 5/10 maybe a 6/10 if there were more missions and added more features. But right now it's going to get refunded. ",False,False

"H1Z1: Just Survive I thought this game was worth playing as a survival fan but unfortunately I was deceived the videos and screenshots looked very promising and indicated a lot of fun and lots of exploration possibilities but unfortunately this is not the case. The game starts quite well with no complications. You choose a server depending on what you want PvP or PvE. So I chose PvP because you think everything will be fine, but appearances are deceptive, as soon as you are in a bigger city you collect your supplies, weapons and ammunition, the game smears. Well and good, but hardly logging in again, you are surrounded by 4 or 5 men who kill one and everything is free. That's how it goes all the time with the game and especially with PvP. Well off to PvE, you are just setting up your base, it is 95% ready, you open your door and then someone stands inside and empties all your boxes and then teleports away. 1 day later Base had finished building everything and then the game got too boring for me, there was nothing more to do in that sense. And then bugs and crashes all the time, which cannot be due to my PC. Because I am not the only one who has this problem. Unfortunately, this game is not recommended unless you want to waste € 20. The game should theoretically be free to play because it cannot be played intelligently. ",False,True

"This is another one of theses cases where I really wish Steam reviews had a ""Thumbs sideways"" option. But since this isn't the case, I can't, in good faith, say I ""recommend"" this game, unfortunately. Which is a damn, damn shame. I really, really wanted to love this game, but I'm finding it very hard to do so right now. I like Momodora RutM a lot and I've been following this game since its announcement as Momodora V and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that it was. I felt really bad for rdein at the time, and was really glad when he managed to change the project around to become what we now know as Minoria, which at the time, looked really good. Now, I really love the theme of the game, I'm a big fan of anime nuns and the lore is interesting so far, the characters all look great. I genuinely love the visual style of this game and I do not believe it is a downgrade in comparison to RutM, just a different style that's not inherently superior nor inferior. The 3D models all look very cute to me and I love the backgrounds and the occasional 2D art, specially in the Fran chats. Although I do think some of the animations are a little less polished than RutM Exploration and platforming feel roughly the same to me, I think it's still fun and I really like the hidden walls in the game. I also was genuinely surprised to see different weapons with different combos, and I love how there's a trick with the RutM weapon to pretty much get a double jump, those little techs are always neat, even if unintentional However, where the game falls short to me, is in the combat, and it is the most relevant part to me. The most basic enemies in the game can take you out in 2 hits and the level up system feels pretty much irrelevant. It's very frustrating at time because the game simply doesn't do a very good job at all in giving you feedback for the damage you take. I died countless times because I ran into an enemy when I was already at half health, without even noticing it! Because I simply didn't think I would be at such a low health after only taking a single hit from another random enemy. Most of the time I actually died due to this rather than getting killed by a single enemy at once.  The issue here is mostly due to the fact that, again, the game simply isn't very good at making you FEEL that you actually took damage, and in turn it feels unecessarily punishing and awkward. If there was more visual aid and feedback, the enemies could even cause the same damage to you, but it wouldn't be so frustrating. (although I do think it's excessive to die in 2 hits to like the most basic mob in the game, and that should be looked into as well) I realize I haven't played much of the game and I'm not getting too deep into the mechanics here precisely because I don't have enough knowledge yet, but this was enough of an issue to me that I simply wanted to stop playing after 1 hour and a half or so. It was just really frustrating getting my progress stumped by what, to me, felt like very cheap deaths. I kinda get what experience they were trying to go after, but I think the game needed to be a lot more polished to provide for that. I think those things can be fixed, however, the devs are focused on bugs, and soft-locking or game-breaking glitches at the moment, which is understandable. But I do hope they address these issues eventually, because they truly hold back the game from being something potentially amazing, which it could have been. Ultimately, at its current state, I just find myself wanting to go back and play RutM, which I might actually do now, since I never got around to finishing that game. Which is a shame, I feel really sorry for not liking this game, because I know how the devs are proud of it, but I simply cannot ignore these issues, they genuinely damper the entire experience for me.

"Attention! Early Access Review! When NCG was announced I was in seventh heaven! The thing is that the Finns, who once created the cool Flatout series, decided to make another game! And it seemed like everything was, and the cool damage model, and the experience of creating similar games, but the publisher was in trouble! Nobody wanted to sponsor the poor finns and they went to conquer the Kickstatrer, but there they were in for a failure! I was already beginning to doubt the quality of their product, but what if the muse of finns really left? But doubts tormented me not for long, after the failure on Kickstarter, Bugbear focused on pre-orders through their own website and then for the purchase they gave a demo with the capabilities of their engine. Then I decided to download the demo to make sure that the Finns are great! The demo turned out to be great, it was able to tighten me up for several hours, mainly because of the cool physics! Time passed, the Finns raised enough money, successfully passed Steam's ""Greenlight"" and now the game appeared on Steam! It was 2014. 2 years later, the game has multiplayer, steam workshop, a couple of tracks and cars and that's it! FOR 2 YEARS ONLY A FEW OF TRACKS AND CARS, CARL !!!

"The developers have been describing all the innovations and delights of the game for so long and talentedly that all fans of the TES line were eager to try it. At the first beta testing, there were a lot of people, as well as bugs, but there are not so many features. Then there were edits, ""finishing"", corrections of jambs. In general, few people, among those who were beta testers, hoped that the game would turn out to be good, even less were satisfied with the results. When the game finally started, it became clear that this was not at all what everyone expected - yes, a huge world, yes, very good music and a ""picture"", but the plot and quest branches, as well as the character leveling branch, are too bad and not what was expected. But, in defense of the quest line, we can say that some of the secondary quests are much more entertaining than the main plot - this is already becoming a feature of the line. Leveling up with quests will be an undoubted plus for fans of the ""European"" style of mmorpg - fierce farming and killing monsters in huge numbers remained at the mercy of Korean games, which pleases. The map and pointers to quests are completely inconvenient; combat mechanics too. Character creation makes you want to cry bloody tears. Flaws in Russification, flaws in the game itself - during the time that TES: Online was created, it was possible to sculpt candy, but it did not work out. Fans of the series get a completely different Tamriel, in which there is too little that players love so much. The crafting system is boring, although there is nowhere without it, because those things that are obtained through quests will not satisfy the needs of high-level characters. The combat system does not allow much to roam - the most convenient are skills. placed on a six-button panel, and even then, most often, one or two skills will be used. Locations such as ""caves"" and individual large buildings upset players - instead of rapidly updating monsters and treasures, most often, you have to bump into crowds of alien characters who have explored and robbed every last thread. For bosses and even mini-bosses, sometimes you have, almost, almost a turn to defend. ",False,False

She went to Yazhmat, who is ready to drown half the world in blood for the sake of her child, with whom she talks throughout the game, which further affects the already dull atmosphere of this game. The most chatty main character in the horror genre. BOTTOM LINE Amnesia: Rebirth is a game that, if it hadn't come out, then no one would have lost anything. Because the game is empty, a template. A stupid plot, which is understood after an hour of play, a stupid protagonist who talks a lot and does stupid things, outdated gameplay that gets bored closer to the middle of the game, little disclosed lore of the game, which gives more questions than answers. Plus, the game has only one - this is the atmosphere, only thanks to it, I passed this game. A crappy product that can be easily miss and lose nothing.

"Recommended: No (personal rating: 0/10) Achievements: No Positive: - Great post-apocalyptic open world - Individual character design - Good combat system Negative: - no longer works after 2 hours of playing time Conclusion: Fallout 3 is a slightly older game, which takes place in a post-apocalyptic world. We start in an isolated vault, but we have to flee from there. After we have left the bunker, we find ourselves in a large open world and go to the next town. There you can take action, chat and quests. The graphics are decent and so is the sound. The world overflows with smaller details and the NPCs were as suspicious of me as in any typical RPG. The combat system, which I liked very much, is innovative. Then why a bad review? Well ... I played the game for 2 hours and after that I couldn't start it.

"It's very rare that I am unable to have at the very least a single praise for a game I don't like. Wow where to begin with this hot mess of a game.....I mean this game is bad and I mean REALLY BAD! The map designs feel like someone is just painting by the numbers adding in only the most basic and mundane boring, bland landscape imaginable. Oh let's not forget when I logged in for the very first time, I received a machine gun volley of invites from every single random person imaginable. I literally got 35 invites within the first minute of logging in which was enragingly annoying. I could not find the settings menu fast enough to turn off notifications. An option such as that should be turned off by default seeing how a new player could get spammed into the ground with invites before they even put their foot in the door.  My gosh never has a game had such atrocious hit detection/registry in all my years of gaming. Aiming in this game is a bad joke and attempting to aim with ironsights is just dogs***. I lined up a target in my ironsights, took precise aim at my oppenent's head and opened fire like crazy only to find out I DID NOT HIT HIM ONCE! So throughout the match I sat there trying to figure out where the hit detection/registry allowed me to damage my opponents. And of all the ridiculous solutions I've found this has got to be the worst. I found out how to make headshots in this game using ironsights. The trick is you don't aim for their head when trying to make a headshot (I know I'm just as confused and surprised as you are by that fact). You aim either at their crotch or the center of your opponent's chest to make headshots which is a**backwards and makes no sense what so ever. And then there is the blatant hacking in this game in which I gotta say wow. People who hack in this game are WAY TOO COMFORTABLE in cheating. From what I've seen these hackers walk around like ""Yeah I'm cheating....The f*** you gonna do about it?!"" In some instances they don't even try to hide the fact that they are cheating which is amazing in a depressing kind of way. Noticed a guy on my team straight destroying people on the other team with just a handgun all the way on the other side of the map. Not saying such a thing is impossible but to have such a high kill count with just a handgun shooting at extreme distances is not something a person can pull off constantly without cheating. But not to worry the other team had their own hacker(s) as well so I guess the equation balanced itself out in a kind of psychotic way. Shame on me for not noticing this sooner. I get rushed by a guy with a shotgun and realize that NOT ONCE during the entire match has he reloaded or ran out of ammo as he is rampaging around the map which is rather suspect if you ask me.  This game basically took all the elements people enjoy in shooter games and combined them together but their execution in designing around these concepts was done in a very mediocre manner. The problem with the designers is that they don't have a clear understanding of why people like or even enjoy these particular elements in the gameplay. I can only tell you about my personal experience and opinion with the game so if you're feeling brave enough to play for yourself (Who knows you miles may vary) ",False,True

So before you comment ""you'only played 2 hours"" please think again and realise Steam is not the only way to play games. I also state I HAD A LOT OF FUN IN ARK.  By all means a fun game with lots to do.  However, I do not accept paid DLC when in Early Access. I do not accept unnecessary price hiking and I certainly do not accept greed and milking the consumers for every little cent they have.

Suits that only have interest in figures and numbers. I have not bought DLC for a long time now and only plan to support DLC when it's needed WELL AFTER release date. A good example would be Witcher 3. As for day 1 DLC...Pfft. Will never touch with a barge pole. That being said, I love gaming, I grew up gaming and will be gaming till I die.

"Generation Zero is an apocalyptic first person shooter. A very controversial game, as well as my opinion about it. I will try to convey to the reader in detail why I did not like the game. To begin with, the graphics in the game are excellent, the change of day and night is simply mesmerizing. Gorgeous picturesque landscapes, detailed robots and very beautiful nature. But identical houses as a blueprint were very disappointing. The game is positioned as a survivalist, but there is absolutely no sense of survival, the character does not need food and sleep, craft is simply useless here. And there is very little variety and content in the game. The character cannot swim in the water, as soon as you get into the water, you will be thrown back onto the shore. What kind of survival can we talk about? The loot and crafting system is far from even the most primitive survivors, for all 15 hours of the game I collected a bunch of different loot, from titanium to threads, and it was not useful to me at all. Unless I sewed a skirt for the character once for fun. So all the craft in the game is useless junk, a kind of illusion of survival. He seems to be, but so boring and dull. You will not be interested in reading the tasks after the first passed island. The idea is very interesting, the first couple of hours are even exciting and keep you in suspense. But then everything very quickly lets go, the storyline turns into ruti, most likely this is because in the game you just follow the tracks and set tasks for yourself. There is no command center that could give you instructions, there are no NPCs, there is no walkie-talkie by which you could communicate with at least some survivors. If you play solo, sooner or later the thought that you are also a ROBOT will start rushing into your head !!! Only he made me play for more than a couple of hours. With friends, everything is more fun, you can gobble up a cake filled with manure for a couple, if there was a like-minded person nearby. Killing robots in a team is much more enjoyable and interesting, but still annoying. For the most part, in 5 hours you will have all the weapons in the game and you will see absolutely all robots, since there are very few varieties of them. All that remains is either to go through a boring and dull plot, or to grind huge robots for the sake of better quality weapons. The first thing that burned me was a bat and a pistol. The fact is that there is a very strange distribution of weapons by slots, if I only have a bat and a pistol, then I cannot put both weapons on the quick slots, you need to choose either a pistol or a bat. But the machine gun, shotgun and pistol can be placed. It somehow stupidly comes out, which is why no one uses the bat, and so this is a very good melee weapon. All weapons in the game have a quality that directly affects their characteristics. At the beginning of the game, as expected, you can only find bad quality. The maximum quality can be knocked out of large robots, there are players who spend tens of hours knocking out, for them this is a kind of goal in the game. The bottom is great. And there is no other vehicle in the game. Despite the fact that a huge pile of cars are scattered around the map and they all flash with emergency lights, as if hinting that the car is in good working order and ready to move, but no, this is just a decoration and nothing more. A bicycle makes sense only if you are going to travel along the road somewhere very far, but walking through bushes and ravines will be many times faster. It is difficult to describe in words how they mocked the control of the iron horse, it seems to me that the developers have never ridden a bicycle in their life. Spectacular fights, beautiful scenery, stunning graphics ... but all this must be accompanied by sufficient content in the game, and it simply does not exist. I didn't want to give a negative review to the end, but there are far fewer positive aspects in the game than negative ones, so I cannot recommend this game. ",False,False

"And now, almost two years later, after I once tried to master this game (very unsuccessfully, by the way), I started it again. And even played a few matches. Unfortunately, I had to delete it right there. Why? That's why. The game is not beginner friendly. Absolutely. Yes, training taught me a thing or two. But there are dozens of heroes in the game! How to learn to play them? And a bunch of all kinds of items in the shop? In such cases, they usually start reading all sorts of guides from other players. So I climbed. But I did not understand ANYTHING. All guides are 60% composed of game slang, incomprehensible to me, a beginner. HOW SO? I'M A NEWBOY, I DO NOT UNDERSTAND IT! Okay, so be it. Moving from theory to practice. I mean, I try to play with other people. It seems to be clearly written that partners are selected according to their skills. That is, I had to play with the same zero-level beginners, it would seem. But it was not there! In every game, beginners are treated with the understanding, ""they say, nothing, learn, I was the same once."" But nooo! Dota 2 players are all pros by and large. Your rivals are constantly killing you, while you cannot kill anyone. And your teammates are outraged to see you drain. They can also complain in support, ""they say, he is such a scoundrel, he raves."" To hell. I have never seen such an attitude towards a beginner in any game. One of the main problems with this game is the community of players. Their attitude towards others, especially newcomers. Just read the comments to the review and you will understand everything. Well, one more aspect. What's the point of the game? Well, I destroyed the turrets, defeated the light / dark. Even pumping as such is not. What is the difference between level 1 and level 101 players? The fact that the second understands the slang in the game and has the right to call the first cancer? Please dismiss. In general, I did not like the game. Yes, she's very colorful. When I saw the art and design of the game itself, I thought ""Wow!"" Yes, Valve did not disappoint, they made a quality product. But if you have never played MOBA games, I strongly advise against trying. Either the impressions will be negative or will drag on forever. Here. UPD: Address to fans: I don't water the game you know what. The game is good, beautiful. I believe that if I learned to play it, I would like it. But the fact remains - my acquaintance with her was unsuccessful. Do I have to play 100 matches to learn how to play it? Pfft, thank you. You don’t watch 50 episodes of a TV show so that you like it?

ROVER have checked their data and are now certain that all users who were entitled to receive their refunds have now had them. Unfortunately, if you still have not received these bloodpoints and shards, then this means you did not fulfil the experiment's criteria.

I am sorry for any disappointment this may cause, but we are unable to assist you further with this query.

"edit: updating review. evidently its getting some attention, so I figured I might as well expand and clarify. tl;dr edition: neither good nor fun. do not buy unless its deeply discounted. I can not refer this game in good faith. There are 2 major things wrong with How to Survive. Firstly, take a look at the DLC. If How to Survive truly is an indie game, control of the project has been overtaken by greedhead corporate dumb think leadership. Someone (likely 505 Games) has opted to make DLCs out of basic features that should have been part of the basic game. Examples are an extra harder difficulty and a hardcore feature. Other DLCs (Heatwave) resemble what would have been unlockables for games only a generation ago. Lastly there are the DLCs that suggest the core game was released unfinished taking the cutting room floor scraps and selling them off as DLC when they got to them later. I don't know if the nickel and diming customers business model bothers you, but it sure as hell bothers me. The second problem is the game itself. Its not good. How to Survive is a perfect example of the tidalwave of schlock being put out by the burgeonning indie industry. It is an inferior imitation of mainstream titles like Diablo and Torchlight. It tries to be unique and original with additional survival features like hunger, thirst, and sleepiness, but they're implemented in a way that make the game tedious and annoying. The quality is painfully amateur and inconsistent. Struggle as a melee character, but have 2 triple bladed boomerangs and you're so golden the game gets dull. The content is particularly slim. Each island is painfully small. And the game itself manages to be as repetitive as Diablo and Torchlight, but in the most flat, boring, and completely unrewarding manner possible. How to Survive lives up to its lousy meta score. No idea why this game has such an overwhelmingly high positive customer review count. The $15 asking price with the lazy DLCs is crazy to me. Other games How to Survive is trying to be are the same exact price and offer more and better quality content minus the annoying survival gimmicks and DLC. Specifically either of the Torchlight games. Honestly, my recommendation is to not buy How to Survive at all. If you absolutely must take the plunge, as stated in the tl;dr above, buy it when its 80-90% off. That way you won't feel too ripped off when you find out how painfully below average it is.

I was wrong.  First I had to use third party software to lock the mouse to the game window to avoid my other 3 monitors but at least it did stretch to 2560x1080. Not that it helped visually. The game is dark and the flashlight doesn't seem to work as shown in screenshots.  A few comparison snips for your own judgement.  Definitely not the flashlight coverage shown in the store screenshots.  In a room with some chairs and a small TV.  The chairs in back light up from all angles, but the ones closest to me do not. Nor is there a ring of light as most dark games with flashlights.  Doors stand out pretty nicely as does blood splatter :D: but you can't see much in the halls to know where you can or can't walk. So lot's of getting stuck in objects as its just blackness.  Upstairs view next to a railing looking down at the bad guy. Makes finding his location nice, but you're still fighting the environment like Pitch Black or The Chronicles of Riddick :happypirate:  So getting past the visual, we have our bad   creature that chases you. Wow is he sensitive! If i moved before he came down the stairs and walked off in the opposite direction he was coming at me. Granted he is slow so you have that to your advantage.

"In this game you play the worst firefighter in the world.  The gameplay is awful, everything about this game is terrible.  Its a simple idea but with so little polish it still feels like an alpha build.  Oddly this game is a port from the Vita so one would think it would be a finished or better product for PC but its actually worse.  This game once it got greenlit literally became abandonware the next day with the devs vanishing never to return to the community or fix any of the issues of the game. This game has zero polish making it feel alpha.  The rooms have doors that are impossible to see without rotating the camera.  This could have been eliminated via putting breaks in the walls where a door is but instead they just gave up on game development.  Worse is that the door if you open it might kill you.  If there is any fire on a door it instantly kills the player.  This would happen alot less if we knew where the doors were.  This game has a time limit so all this camera sweeping to look for doors which could be anywhere takes alot of that time away which is gamebreaking for a game that requires a timer. This game you need to rescue civilians but they just fall over and die when entering rooms sometimes.  Other times there can be fire nowhere near them and they still just fall over and die.  One of the worst things is there can be civilians who want an item like a woman who wants her purse.  She will literally just stand in one spot and die if you dont bring her purse. The firefighter literally cant handle fire.  There can be a tiny fire in a room and the heat will build if you cant find it then you just die.  You can walk into a room for 2 seconds and die from the heat.  This firefighter literally has no protection at all.   The controls are terrible.  The camera moves using the same thumbsticks as rotating the character.  This makes playing the game a nightmare because you cant move the camera independently of changing your characters focus.  This could have easily been fixed by putting the camera on the right bumper and left bumper.  but why bother playing the game?  most devs dont they just make it completely clueless about game design being more code monkey than anything related to actual game making.  Anyone can make a game today, 8 year olds can and have and they work better than games like this. The WORST part of this game is if it just randomly deletes your game save.   This game is treated like garbage by the devs who just threw it on steam never bothering to fix anything making this game the literal garbage of steam and like all trash it should be removed from the steam store. The devs dont care about the game and ran away once it was greenlit, so if the devs dont care about their own game why should anyone else care to buy it?   Rating:  0/10  Value: $0.00 ",False,False

"Recovered in the Humble Choice and the second game of the genre of Frontiers, I am a little disappointed by several aspects like everyone else: - Few dinosaurs and especially a lack of variety. - Cannot modify buildings. - The missions are a bit limited in terms of variety. - Obviously Denuvo - Lots of interesting content in DLC and iconic especially for fans of the first trilogy. - More bugs ... - All the security part and sometimes boring to manage. - The cards are too small. - If you are obsessed with placing buildings, you will cry. There are some positive points, already it is very beautiful and the first hours of discovery are really very nice. There are some great ideas like being able to play with the dinosaur code to change their behavior. I believe that the dubbing, even in French, is that of the films.

"Looking at game-play footage of this game, I was given hella ""EA Skate"" vibes, and that enticed me to buy it. I went in thinking I'd be playing it casually, however, after playing it for as long as I did, the best way I can describe it accurately is if Skate wanted to be the next Dark Souls and wanted to kick you in the nuts repeatedly while it was at it. It even makes it clear upon launching that the game will be unforgiving, which disappointed me on a casual level. The controls are off-putting--triggers to steer/turn your skater in the air, left stick to control front foot and right stick to control back, etc--and customization--in its current form--is hideously limited as it gives you a generic Skater to play as. Until this game gives you the option to have Skate-like controls--which I prefer over this clunky mess--I won't be picking this up again anytime soon. I'd gotten a refund after playing the game for 83 minutes, 20 or so of which were most likely after I'd finished the tedious, bone-grinding difficult tutorial. As it stands, I wouldn't get Session right now. First impressions are everything, and I was left with a bit of a sour taste just seconds into playing. I'd say give it a few months or so. If the game still isn't accessible for a casual audience by then, steer clear unless you want your face to meet with the pavement and run up that hospital bill. I cannot recommend this game to the casual gamer, such as myself. That's not to say I didn't have fun with it. On the contrary. I got used to the controls, but I could not grind to save my life. That said, only the hardcore will flourish in this love letter ""to the golden era of Skateboarding"". ",False,True

"Here is the thing, It isn't exactly the game itself, as much as it is the community. When the game first came out, the community for it was amazing! Everywhere you looked, you could see a player in every map. It was a game where you had to work together to make any progress. You knew the big name players; FangBlade, Tigger, CurryIsHot, etc. The community was there. It was loving, it was caring, it was a game that you wanted to play with friends instead of alone. It wasn't so much how long it took to get somewhere, as opposed to how you got there. Now the game is just too quick and easy to do anything. There are far too many classes, and instead of using skills from each class; (for example, one of the most famous party quests, the Ludibrium Tower PQ, you NEEDED to have at least a magician and a thief in your party otherwise you could not complete the party quest) is now replaced with 'HEY I CAN BEAT EVERY BOSS IN THE GAME IN 2 DAYS BY MYSELF BECAUSE I BOUGHT NX'. It just doesn't have the same player base, and I believe that is the reason so many people are quitting. As someone who has played since 2006, these 10 years have really brought a change to my eyes on the game I once loved. Here are some key points: 1) The game is too rushed now. I know leveling slow sounds boring, but back in the day the excitement of getting to level 21 after hours of work so you can start Kerning PQing with your friends. Getting your 2nd job took work and then going to Ludi PQ was another fun adventure when you had friends to do it with. Getting tracks and looking for the best 'clicker' to get you into the PQs and what not. It was fun. Someone being level 70 back then was amazing. You'd look up to them. Now you can get it within 5 hours of playing hard. When Zakum first came out, for a long time there was a select few who could even dream about getting a zakum helmet, now everyone has one. 2) Pay to win. They added all this new stuff to upgrade your items like cubes and I don't even know what else. Back in the day the only thing that NX bought you was cool hair, clothes and pets. Now, if you wana be the best at this game, you have to pay a lot of money for it with cubes, and other NX items. 3) Simplicity. This is what is turning me off at the moment. Back when I played, there was only Mage, Bowmen, Theifs and Warriors (and the rare 'beginner' main), and it was awsome. Each class had strengths and weaknesses at different points in the game, and the world wasn't too gaint to explore. The old saying 'if it ain't broke don't fix it' I think. People enjoyed making one of each of the 4 classes (even more if you wanted Spearman, fighter, F/P mage, clerics, bandits etc). Now, when I opened maplestory, I see like 20 different classes at least, and each probably have their own sub-classes, it's just too much imo. Back then it was easy to balance (in fact they almost never had to balance any classes cause they were so equal) but, I imagine with this many classes now, sometimes they get out of balance and certain ones outshine heavily.

Why, then, such 100-story wet reviews are written about this game, calling it the best in the series (and almost the best strategy), when, for example, in ""X-COM: Terror From The Deep"" (which, in fact, is more of a mod) there is no this bug, but the underwater theme seems more interesting?

Doesn't help to get a better community, but it may help to at least make bullies and bad kids being together and people who are there to get fun together. So yeah, that'd require to rework matchmaking and stuff... -Being able to kick afk people who have put something on their mouse to spam left clic. And so a matchmaking during matches because when people leave or when you have afks in team... Well... You know that you cannot do a thing but try to kill people. Games with balls and such are not doable when you're the team down. -Season Pass progress through campaign... I dunno if I just didn't find the option, but when I enabled score or competitive score, it didn't progress the season pass, and that's annoying. I know it's mainly because Reach is my least favorite campaign, but it'd be great to progress through any kind of gameplay. -(from Hidden Xperia's videos) Getting off the controller's aim assist or having two different matchmakings with one enabled and one disabled. Or give mouse and keyboard aim assist too, LOL. (destroys the game for PC, can't make it with an aim assist, sadly). -(The one I'm not sure it's doable, but Halo would 500% get better with that) Custom crosshair. The one from the original game is so annoying because I love the cross or the dot... But this circle is just the worst crosshair I've ever experienced...

"Write to the icefield that is about to unlock, excerpt from my essays written in the black box. If the game is scored according to the media standard, it must be above 85, but its name is Guaihun. In the field of fighting games, only Guaihun can be compared with Weihun. Therefore, in the quality of the ice field, I can only play. Travel reviews. It's not that it's not fun compared to other games, but I think Icefield is just a scrap of the series. -------------------------------------------------- ----------- As soon as Canglan Xing arrived at the weapon workshop, all the iron wielders looked at him and smiled, and some shouted, ""Canglan Xing, I heard that you are planting mandarins again! He did not answer, and gestured to the weapon master, ""Put in five soundproofs, three physical strength, and one adversity."" He took off his equipment and counted nine inlay holes. They deliberately yelled again, ""You must have been a cat again!"" Cang Lan Xing opened his eyes wide and took out a small notebook to write, ""Why are you so innocent..."" ""What innocence? I saw it the day before yesterday. You bumped into pickled cucumbers in the Demon Gathering Land, hanging and hitting."" The Blue Star flushed, and the blue veins on his forehead burst out, and angrily wrote, ""Trigger unyielding cannot be counted as a cat... unyielding!... What about the elites of the fifth regiment, can it be regarded as a cat car?” There are successively incomprehensible ghost symbols, such as ""steps are dung,"" or ""claws catching wrong"", which caused everyone to laugh: inside and outside the studio is full of joy. air. -------------------------------------------------- ---------- It is said that one day the housekeeper cat asked the draftsman to draw a picture of ""Blue Star Investigating Mineral Veins"" in the hanging hut. When the manuscript was submitted, it was painted with a big fat ball and a fat man eating. ball. The housekeeper cat asked: ""What is this painting? What is the big fat ball?"" ""It is Yuechen's grandmother chef."" The draftsman replied. ""Where is the little fat ball!?"" ""It's Aibo."" ""But where is the blue star?"" ""The blue star is investigating the veins."" The draftsman looked serious. -------------------------------------------------- --------- Icefield shouldn’t need to be introduced by me. Three new monsters for 300 yuan, New World Gold Miner and Osteologist, a dungpit-like place for gathering demons, and shit-like hooks. The R12 beads that can’t be brushed... After discussing with the hunting gang, the problem of the ice field can be summarized as a ""rhythm"" problem, one is the rhythm of hunting, and the other is the rhythm of the game as a whole. The hunting rhythm is a problem with the hook and claws. You have to follow the official gameplay, which greatly affects the hunting rhythm. In the big guy’s words, it’s like you’re playing a cannon. If you hit half of the women, you’ll have a rest. Okay, the rest will continue, and then you’re tired after a few rests, and you’ll lose your interest after a few rests... Aside from the idiot-like hook judgment, this mechanism prevents the infinite lock and also makes some monsters easy to play. It's a mixed bag. The overall rhythm of the game must be sprayed. The main line is okay for 20 hours. After the main line, I suspected that the production team had the mentally retarded soup of nm Ming Bolong in their minds. I didn't take it out, but I wanted to put it in the place of gathering. High level unlock. Especially Huajia Baazi, a large part of the reason why the father bought the ice sheet is to fuck her, but Capcom told you to eat 100 hours of shit to HR99. Needless to say, the 4G shield and axe left the old man who entered the Juma area and spent the night in the Miasma Valley. When I saw the face of the old lover for many years, I had a small roar and a 360-mouth cannon. Finally, GP connected the two super solution. There is no response at all. I waited for you for 5 years, but you refused to give it to me. I can’t think of a game I’ve played for 12 years and I’m going to belittle it now. Maybe it’s really the production team Jiang Lang who is exhausted. There is no body. When the beads are brushed, the deer who attacked the beads rammed randomly, and there is no MH4G suddenly. Identified the AV image quality of Man Gong Man Zhan excavating when I took photos with my mobile phone and showed it to sand sculpture group friends or forum netizens. Playing the icefield, I was like a high paraplegic patient who could only move his fingers and was slumped in a chair. A cup of it fell without smoke, and a broken picture for a day. Medical miracles can only occur when mining the map of the Valley of the Gathering Miasma, throwing the handle and shouting silly X mosquitoes, I will power you Gobi. But people, the essence is true fragrance. I really want to throw down the handle and greet the painful anus. I want to hunt my ancestors. Hunter said I won’t play anymore, but this game is just like engaging in an object. I clicked on the icon the next day and said baby I missed it. You, and then there was a sudden quarrel and real fragrance. Finish the pass-Xiang; Where is Lei Niang? ——Shit; When you see Lei Niang-Fragrant is crazy; When you see that you can't beat Lei Niang, you must first liver progress-overnight feces; After the liver is so painful, kill Lei Niang a meal-eat barbecue in the middle of the night; You write the paper, teacher rubs it; Finally, the liver has a black boom, and the shield axe GP rushes-my sister, the father is here; the black boom action AI is completely changed, super hard to understand-my sister is Qiao Biluo; ...... ---- -------------------------------------------------- ---- I often think back to the time when the wasteland was reclaimed 2G and 4G, people were addicted to food, and the ban was lifted for more than a hundred hours (the village and the assembly were separated from each other). Then 4G gave you a guild 140 system, which allows you to slowly practice skills without losing the task level, and occasionally produce the best mining. Although I will never graduate, I think this is what a hunter should be, and there is no end to improvement. On the other hand, looking at the world's bead mechanism, the slag slag glow system, and the ice sheet mechanism, the graduation time is set at about 300 hours, giving an upper limit of equipment. The advantage of this is that it has an end like most games, which meets the needs of most modern players. But the problem is that some weird mechanisms have been set up so that the lack of game content will let repetitive players take the blame. In my opinion, this is a deduction point, and I believe it does not conform to the views of most players. The third prince said he didn't know what the strange hunting would be like in the future, and we didn't know, because the game always follows the times. In the future when leisure time is becoming less and less, and everyone is playing games for playing instead of liver, I am really afraid, I am really afraid that something like this will happen: One day, the blue star will come to the weapon workshop. After a while, I haven't seen it for a long time. At the Star Festival, the weapon master opened the list and said, ""Blue Star still has a wish list that hasn't been done yet!"" By the second year's thank you ceremony, he said, ""Blue Star still has a wish list that hasn't been done yet!"" To Fengshou Ji didn't say anything, and didn't see him even at the Star Festival. People finally haven't seen it until now-about Blue Star will not be in the game again. -------------------------------------------------- ------ May the blue star guide the strange hunt forward!

There are tons of things that have gone wrong with this game and they try to fix it by putting in new stuff that in return I think just jamms it up more to put it simply. If you dont have Premium then it is going to take you forever to get money up. There are constant Lag spikes and disconnections all across the game. People always saying something about there problems in game world chat do to servers and game glitches. The more they add and the more they dont fix problems at hand the worse the game will become.

"Something that catches your eye immediately. The style is at the highest level. Not a bad cyberpunk soundtrack that doesn't start over after death as it usually does. The HUGE and most important plus of the game is that after death there are no loading screens, you are simply revived before the battle. P.S. I have experience in runners, so I know what interesting games in this genre can look like. Here are examples: I played a runner with the theme of the future """" I played in """", in which new mechanics appear from level to level, and the levels themselves are made in different ways. I played a runner with a glove and a well-written storyline """" All levels are visually the same. They all have gray colors. And you don't have the feeling that you are moving somewhere. It's like you are running the same level. This is the first thing you get tired of. The whole mechanics of the game consists of: -> Running on the walls. -> Attraction with a whip. -> LMB strike. -> Dash to SHIFT. No new chips with new levels are added. What you see at the 2nd level will be at 10m. An interesting level 1-2, where you can cut enemies, but at level 3 and further you will have to run around the location in search of a PROTECTIVE SPHERE to destroy it, because while she is actively enemies are invulnerable. This is the second thing you get tired of. We are the resistance that must stop a villain who was previously good but turned out to be a traitor. It seemed to me intrusive, too bright yellow. I recommend disabling it immediately in the settings. it's easier to see enemies without it. To run along the wall, you do not need to clamp W. He runs himself (AND IT'S AWESOME BAD), just jump on this wall. If you release W to make the hero jump, he will still keep running. Here you run along the wall. There is an enemy and an abyss in front of you, so you need to press the SPACEBAR so as not to fall, and then jump onto the enemy. You press the spacebar, pointing the camera down, but the character jumps to the next wall and continues to run. In some places I crashed into some pitch-black ledges and fell, somewhere I flew past the place where I needed to land, because the character's movements are unpredictable. (You have to get used to them). Enemies are gray, they merge with the terrain, but to prevent this from happening, you can UPLINE with a perk so that there are contours around the enemies)))) Pumping seems to be there ... But only it is not needed, because it is somehow useless. As for me, I have never used any skills in all the time, if it was NOT OBLIGATORY to advance the plot. And most people do not use skills in this game, this can be understood by going to the ""Achievements"" of the game and check the percentage of people who received these achievements for using the skills. Someone doesn't care about her. But there are people, including me, who are trying to get into this table (in any game), set a record, pass the level faster than others. And the top players in this table consist of cheaters who complete the level in 0 deaths and 0-10 seconds. Either they stop the timer, or just fly to the finish line in the NO CLIP fashion.

"Textures clip, there are no interiors, no bots, the free-cam mode is nauseating, the lifeboats interact horribly with the player and I just expected a bit more from this. Maybe it was naivety from the fact I am somewhat of a Titanic enthusiast and I was too arrogant to accept the reviews before playing it myself or maybe I wanted to just see why this game has such a divisive review score but what I do know is that buying and playing this game was a waste of my time. There are no interiors in this game. You cannot go inside the ship. Heck, you can't even walk down the two of the sets of stairs near the middle of the ship underneath the third funnel because the frame is too low down for your character to fit through! I was very disappointed in this aspect because I was expecting to be able to 'relive the experience' as it says on the header image and not just see the outside decks. I wasn't expecting a huge story and immense unreal engine 4 graphics but I just expected a little more than what I actually got. I understand that this is a small company and things like modelling the entire inside of the ship and NPCs and such are outside the budgeting range but you cannot make claims of reliving the experience when that is not what you have created. I don't feel that it is necessarily disrespectful to the survivors of the event but I do feel it is disrespectful to the consumers of the product. The lifeboats work and do their job. I have no issue with the lifeboat itself, just how it interacts with the player. The lifeboats will sometimes knock the player out of the boat from moving too fast in comparison to the player's own speed in keeping up or the boat's seats will trap the player between them and it will make a horrible and irritating collision noise. Both these problems could be easily fixed by just providing an option to actually sit in the boat. The free-camera is extremely awkward and difficult to control. It sways so much and just does not feel fluid at all. I was able to get some nice screenshots though once I was able to tame the free-cam and get it to where I wanted it though so this is more of a moot point.  The mouse constantly disappears and renders the menus unusable (first noticed this after the titanic sank and I was sent back to the main menu but started to occur more frequently and in more places upon starting again). Annoyingly, the camera also follows the mouse (when it works) in the pause menu.  There is no quit to main menu. This is more of a point of convenience rather than something that affects gameplay but I still feel it is worth mentioning because it was quite annoying having to quit to desktop and relaunching the game every time I just wanted to return to the menu.

"FarCry 5 - Did I tell you what madness is? ... Madness is the exact repetition of the same action, over and over again, in the hope of change. A project developed by the great and terrible Ubisoft released on March 27, 2018 on all platforms. The game's plot starts in the state of Montana, which was captured by a sect led by Joseph Sith. Killing people, taking property in short, parasitizing in every possible way in Hope County. The protagonist with a group of policemen tried to arrest him, of course it was not successful, several people died and the GG decided to lead the resistance and overthrow all the sectarians in the world, save the world and stuff like that. In short, the plot is shit as always. Cool sectarian stories or horribly written friendly NPCs do not add interest in any way and by hour 10 you start to skip them. Gameplay: As has been the custom recently in the studio's super games, we have a large map divided into 3 sectors. Each sector has its own leader. He needs to be overthrown by various dirty tricks. We carry out side quests, storyline tasks that are no different from side quests, collect collectible items, capture outposts, break the property of sectarians. All according to the behest of the great and terrible Mafia III, Just Cause, all sorts of TomClancy's GhostRecon Wildlands and other terribly annoying and not interesting games. You can also search for treasures and hunt. There is both ground and air transport. The shooting is done well, stealth is present in the game, although very simple, partners have been added. There are weapon upgrades and character customization. Here are just the same upgrades for any weapon. Want a muffler for your pump action shotgun? No problem dude. 8x machine gun sight? Why not? I generally did not understand the meaning of the presence of customization of the GG. Why is she in a 1-person game? You see only your arms and legs, as it were. Constant respawn of enemies in the style ""God forbid our favorite player gets bored"" is terribly annoying. It is corny to walk on the map. This problem is solved exclusively by a complete clean-up of the region, and even then not completely. The towers were removed from the game !!!!! but in fact it would be better to leave them. Running from npc to npc, finding out the location of this or that in-game of activity, or looking for notes and maps to open the mark can fuck ... the dead. At first it all looks interesting, but the constant repetition of the same actions tires you already at 10 hours of play. In general, this is the project that you need to play in a measured way. A couple of hours a day or better every other day. Otherwise, it very quickly risks being lost from your SSD. Graphics and music are made at a high level as always by Ubi. This is perhaps the best part of the game. Outcome: An open world in which you have to entertain yourself. Thanks to Ubisoft for great games. 5/10 The game is worth buying only with a hefty discount. It is generally not advisable to take the Season Pass. With such a heap of variety, not many will make it to the end of a simple campaign, let alone DLC. And the reviews for add-ons from Ubi are, as always, very controversial. P / s: Average project, average rating. The game also has a co-op mode and an Arcade mode. I have not seen either 1 or 2, and to be honest there is no desire. For 26 hours in FarCry, I got tired of constantly filling this resistance scale with the same actions for the sake of meeting the next boss. Ubi, as always, follows the path of pragmatism. We make a medium project with a beautiful wrapper and disrupt a ton of sales. Perhaps even such a construction of the gameplay will come to someone.

"PUBG is a dirty game in terms of hardware load and you just have to say that boldly and directly. Despite known problems with loading the world, the development team doesn't seem to give a shit, so that even with a normal computer, crashes occur again and again, players and their parachutes are not loaded or the houses appear ""melted"". A NoGo so shortly before the release! There can be no question of development with community feedback here. Instead, a second map is quickly being tinkered with, more weapons and the vaulting. Clearly the wrong priorities! After all, you should first fix the known errors of the first map before working on a second one. But money makes the world go round. There are also problems with the network and server connection. Desyncs, lags, etc. etc. Probably also correlates with the loading of the world, but is especially noticeable in response times. Very clearly especially when opening doors. It may be a small thing, but it should also be present in other, more elementary places. However, it is not so noticeable because other factors also play a role there, e.g. when aiming into fights. Added to this is the cheater problem, which is supposedly addressed, but as in the past with Counter-Strike, the config settings can also be adjusted here so that you enjoy advantages - nothing other than cheating. Conclusion Not to be recommended for the price of 29.99 €. Because, in my opinion, you don't have any fun playing the game if the said errors keep occurring. This is more frustrating because you ask yourself ""What is this about?"" The current status of the game doesn't change much, because the focus is not on troubleshooting but on expansion and testing - regardless of whether two teams are working side by side or not. Certainly explains the mixed feedback for the best-selling and most-played game on Steam. ",False,True

"In general, I do not like to write negative reviews, especially on games that I did not really expect, but here is an exception. I wanted to play strategy, the choice fell on a new total var, I will say right away, I was not a fan of the Wahi and had almost zero idea of ​​the universe (especially fantasy). But after watching the screenshots, videos, and then, after reading a little lore, I was impressed and decided to buy. And now the pros / cons. Pros + The world of the game, as I already wrote, was absolutely not familiar with the universe. But when I started to get interested, I was very impressed, perhaps, the main thing that attracted me to the game is that the local world here is very similar to the real world of the late 15th and early 17th centuries, that is, early modern times, one of the moss favorite eras. This can be traced to the atmosphere / social relations in the game / technology level, etc. In addition, many states have real analogies (an example of Bretonnia is France / England in the early modern times). + An interesting game universe, it is rather unusual for a total var to switch to a fantasy theme. + Graphics, for strategy it looks very good, the game map is beautiful, the maps for custom battles also look very nice. + Optimization, I did not find any complaints, even in hard mixes with a maximum of troops, all the rules. + Land battles, very high quality, very spectacular, I especially liked the variety and elaboration of the troops, a special type of troops appeared - heroes. + Casual, as anyone, but for me plus, I do not like complex games, in general from the whole series of total var is the simplest. + Support for the Steam Workshop, there are very high quality mods at times increasing the interest in the game. + Delays hours by 50-100 rail. Cons - The most important thing is DLC and their price. Not only is the game itself not cheap (which is a bit too much for it below). I'm already used to the fact that all modern games come out cut down, and then sold in pieces. But fuck what Sega did is just up. Not only did they cut out the KEY RACES, they also sell them for 9 bucks for wood elves, beastmen, and somewhere else 5 for chaos, FOR CHAOS. BUT THIS IS STILL NOT THE END, after reading about the world of the game, I realized that we were just presented with a tightly cut game, you can't play either for the southern states or for the northern ones, we can't choose the provinces of the Empire, Kislev. The game simply lacks the Lizzards and the New World, Arabia, the High Elves, and it is quite obvious that sooner or later they will add everything, but I'm even afraid to imagine how much it will cost. Segi should learn from The Witcher 3, where DLS surpasses most modern AAA games in quality, and are quite adequate. -Little content, the game looks stripped down, you can play without DLS, but if you get involved, you will simply have to buy them just for fun. The game does not look at its price. And one more disappointment, WHERE ARE THE PREVIOUS TOTAL BARS ACHIEVED? It feels like this is the first game of developers. Where are the sieges as in attila, where are the naval battles of the second Rome, where is normal diplomacy as in the shogun, where is the normal construction system that was back in 2004 in the first Rome, but in the first Rome we saw how our city was developing, growing, there was a bunch of unique buildings, but what is there? Barracks-stable-fields-tavern-etc. The tech tree is so-so explored pretty quickly. -Balance, well, this is purely my opinion, but for example, vampires are quite imbibing. That's basically all, but there are not a lot of minuses. But they are very significant. In principle, the game can drag on for a large amount of time, it is still interesting to play, especially if you still buy a DLS, but it seems to me that the game will really be suitable in a year and a half, when all the DLS / add-ons are released before, and MAYBE SEGI WILL MAKE A DISCOUNT. In the meantime, my rating is 6.5 / 10. If you are a fan of total wara / wahi take it. If you just look at what it is, then I recommend either waiting for all additional releases or discounts.

One issue being, The game reccomends 'TEAMS' for you to join, however, these teams consist of people **Most of the time** being level 100+ which means you won't do didly squat to any of those enemies.

"The game does not cost 1000 rubles. 200 - edge. In all aspects, worse than the 5th part, in my opinion. Yes, there is more time for the passage, but not due to the plot, but due to artificial ""sticks in the wheels"". We play with corefan and experience constant problems with the network: delays and disconnects after an hour or two of playing together. This was not the case in the 5th part. Management is over. What kind of fool thought of jumping over obstacles and running one key to do? Because of this, it turns out that you climb the stairs, for example, when you run away from an evil helicopter and anthropomorphic oilcakes, but because of the curvature of the controls, you jump down to them and die. Or you run away in a straight line, accidentally touching a box of some kind, after which the Persian instantly begins to slide back through it ... Too much of a sensation for me, even at the very minimum: for moving from edge to edge of the carpet - 2.5 turns per 360. Inventory also for an amateur. In my opinion, in part 5 it was easier with him. And the fact that everyone has their own loot and emblems, and not common ones, also enrages. Too much action. There are scenes when you definitely need to fire a shot, and if you don't, then the operation will fail. We pass at maximum difficulty. There are almost always no cartridges (why are they when you can spawn experience for us, for which you unlock skills that do not work at maximum difficulty?). Korefan often runs around with a knife. The result, I think, is clear. Grafon: characters are approximately at the same level as in part 5, textures 50/50: part is better, and the other part is complete trash; background prints are of terrible quality. There are no riddles. Action only. [3/10] ",False,False

"Serious Sam: The Random Encounter Does its name justice ... it's random ... We are thrown into a top-down world in the style of the old ""Legend of Zelda"" games. Here we have to solve some small ""puzzles"", which are mostly limited to only collecting a key, or we can find boxes with random objects. At every step we have the chance to meet opponents that are generated randomly (under certain conditions). The fights are a mixture of real-time and turn-based systems. Sam is on the right-hand side and a large bunch of enemies come from the left, whom we exterminate with various weapons as we are used to from ""Serious Sam"". In the turn-based part we choose whether and how we fire the weapons, whether we want to change weapons or use items. Then the game runs for 5 seconds in which we can dodge with Sam and adjust the trajectory of some weapons. The weapon selection itself is not excessive, but has been well met with different roles. Likewise, the opponents are relatively well chosen apart from a few exceptions whose attacks are, in my opinion, a bit poorly balanced. Later you get two more companions who can perform the same actions as Sam. This gives us more firepower, but we are nowhere near as good as dodging, as all three are in a vertical line and you can no longer dodge that far up or down. I think the basic principle is great and extremely fun because it is really entertaining fun. But ... the game is too random. Sounds strange but that's how it is. The opponents are so different in strength and number that certain worlds are absolutely impossible to lock and you lose all your lives, and the next attempt can be such an absolute breeze that we don't even get any damage. The same problem prevails with the bosses. Especially the final boss. I had a few attempts where I could only do minimal damage to him and had used up all my items, while the last attempt was so quickly over that I was totally surprised how quickly it went. I had used the same tactics and weapons and was just lucky as he moved. The problem is further emphasized as the items are also generated randomly, and sometimes you just don't get the things you want or need. Due to this strong trial and error, the actual playing time is greatly stretched and the fact that I was through with the game in about an hour and a half, and also played the second Endless mode (which has exactly the same problems) in order to see if this is better, shows how little substance there is. I think the game principle is great, but unfortunately without a sophisticated implementation. So I can't recommend the game, even for the € 4 it costs. If it's on sale for as little as € 1 or so, you might be able to check it out, but unless the game is upgraded and expanded, you won't be missing out on much.

"Very bad impression in first few games.. Simply put its gameplay trash compared to FIFA, there's no control on ball whatsoever, no fluidity.. players take so much time to pass the ball that it gets snatched if you pass it in the last moments... only bcoz your player took too much time to pass the ball.. even when you pressed the button earlier. No proper responsiveness. Also it feels like controls are messed up, there's no accuracy on ball control, you do one thing but sometime you end up off the target bcoz of either inaccuracy or slow responsiveness. When you want to shoot the ball in the net after a pass through, your shot button will only response when your striker catches up & touches the ball, only then your player will prepare to shoot... which takes too much time to take the shot, obviously you don't have that much time your opponent's goal territory. If you press shoot button early (even while you are about to catch up the ball), even if your player is a few inches away from ball, your striker will give up the ball & let it go to either goalkeeper or outside, missing a very good opportunity to score as if player is not interested in scoring the goal at all... All bcoz of the lack of responsiveness OR gameplay mechanics are like this. Only graphics are ""slightly"" better than FIFA but i doubt anyone cares about graphics in a Football game, all that matters is a football game is ""gameplay"". And yeah these are the things i have observed in 3-4 games in just 50 minutes of gameplay.. i felt the difference right away compared to FIFA.

Rating: 2/5 I brought this game because of the overwhelming amount of positive reviews but it turns out to be disappointing. The kind of game play it has reminds me of games I used to play on mobiles 10 years back. And I wonder what made developers to think of such old mobile  gaming concept to PC. I've only played this for few hours but I already feel kinda bored.  First of all you play the game viewing from top. So you cant even see characters properly. Secondly almost 80% of game is you driving around and racing. The rest of the game is blowing ♥♥♥♥ around and stealing things.

Since everything is the same, it gets very boring halfway through so I no longer enjoy the gameplay. As a result, you simply sit down and shoot to finish the game as quickly as possible.

"Excellent atmosphere and style of the game, a separate respect for the perk icons, but all this is spoiled by the terrible optimization, the game will lag even if you have a video card with 4 gigabytes of video memory, I can recommend to patient people who will put up with drawdowns up to 50 fps, or to those who have nuclear reactor.

"Twenty-three fucking hours later ... What I want to say here, procedural generation of planets works well, there are different weather conditions, a variety of procedurally generated fauna, flora.

"TL:DR Game is nowhere near worth it's amount and has many problems that should be fixed. I rarely ever write reviews for the games I play whether I enjoy or hate them but given the circumstances for this game in particular, a review is a must. And from what I've played, this game is absolutely garbage. This game is a DEATHMATCH style moba, not a King of the Hill. You fight against 7 other opponents in a battle to the death. You have 4 lives. Last person left standing is the winner. Let's start with the classes. There are four classes in the game at the moment which consists of your generic Knight, Archer, Axeman and Mage. These classes are extremely unbalanced and the Knight class will win in a fight almost every single time. Playing a class such as Archer will only net you kills is if your enemy has noticeably health than you or you're not being directly targeted. You're also given no description of any of the classes, it's abilities, DPS, speed, or anything. All there is to see is the look and name of your character doing a certain animation. I'm not sure if I missed it during the loading times or anything but there seemed to have not been any proper place to select my character other than clicking on them in the profile screen then joining a queue, which forced me to play Archer the whole time whether I wanted to or not. Once you actually get yourself into a match, you'll find how dull the music is and how cheap and repetitive the sound effects are with the only thing keeping me playing is the cluster♥♥♥♥ of people going at it and getting some cheap kills at the knights before dying to one yourself. The majority of the content really is killing others until they run out lives, which isn't bad but isn't really good either. When the match is over, the back to main menu button is temporarily disabled.....HOW DOES THAT MANAGE TO OCCUR??!?  But for all I saw that is bad, there are a few pros being the controls feels really for how it plays although the buttons on the main menu is a bit iffy at times. The animations graphics are also pretty decent except the ones again in the main menu. And these are my opinions on the game I had created when I had started up and played for the first time. Given that I had played and created this review in early access, most of everything wrong here can be changed such as: These are all basic suggestions however and won't create a great game from hopefully fixing these alone. I leave the creativity part up to you guys. ",False,True

"Good day! Xcom 2 is my first experience in this genre. There is nothing to compare it with, so there will be only dry criticism! I'll start with the pros: + Beautiful graphics + Destruction of the environment + Large selection of character customization + Non-linearity of missions + Pumping, both the base and characters with weapons + Plots And now the cons: - The system for calculating damage to the enemy (absolute random) , With a 30% chance of hitting, the character can hit the target and vice versa, with a 70% chance to miss. I'm not even talking about the absurdity when you shoot at point blank range and the character with unnatural animation deflects the sight of the enemy and shoots past. Since this is the main component of gameplay by 70 percent, it becomes unbearable to play at more difficult levels! I do not recommend buying this game for the money it sells. It's a candy wrapper! Its price is 400-500 rubles. not more. If you want to buy, then wait for good discounts! Have a nice game! ",False,False

"The gameplay of this game is nice, you can do some really crazy stuff with it, however, it's very scarce and simple in comparison to the non-reboot games in the series, specially 4 and 5. And the inclusion of a button to dodge just feels...weird with this type of game too. The combo system is a tad broken, as you only need to switch between 1/2 moves apparently before you can repeat the other. And I don't have to mention that the story is horrible, right? Cause it's not news at this point. It's practically your generic trope of protagonist, secretly bad guy but  , terrible sidekick. You can see the story from miles away, specially if you played the original games. It almost feels forced. But at least the final fight is very satisfying(until you have to figure out you need Devil trigger to finish it.) The Vergil's DLC is more acceptable, but Vergil has a moveset that is very small for you to consistently combo without getting your ass capped by an attack. But it's not a surprise, since you only need to use 2 combos to even do a S Rank. ",False,False
"This game is a nice little arcade style game that would be fun if you played with a steering wheel controller, but unfortunately I don't have one so this game was pretty boring to me.

"Initially was a positive review... Changed this to reflect latest 20MB patch which now only allows 8 clicks per second when using auto clickers Devs somehow think people don't use auto clickers to play games like this? so my almost 700 hrs game time has been wasted, forced to use money because paywalls have been put in place. No where do devs stipulate you cannot use an auto clicker For an EA game this isn't the smartest thing to do, you've just gone and changed the rules when the game was hard enough as it was Game is ruined now... Totally avoid this game, you're going to spend months getting anywhere or you will be forced to spend real money EDIT so I decided after what I consider a completion of the game, to post my thoughts 1st things 1st, devs do respond to things that are broken, so if things have happened to you in game where money is involved or not, they will personally fix this, I like this and praise the devs for this care and attention: this is where the praise ends unfortunately So the game i have now clocked up 900+ hours and I found while it kept me occupied, there was very little to do that was rewarding. I was an active player so used an auto clicker (I advise to use one and it's not cheating as some suggest), the game stalls for some reason and I don't think the migration from Mobile platform to PC has worked well in favor of devs So you can complete this game without money and what I mean complete is 100% achiements, after that there is no real reason for me to continue It's a lot of time and I personally would not do this ever again, but the timing was right and I had spare time based on certain personal goals being achieved, given I pooled my efforts into this (being a fan of the TV show caught my attention so thought any meme could be a good meme). I soon recognised how much effort was required to get my 100% fulfilment, this was a social experiment gone horribly wrong, things changed in the game that made progression feel retarded, held back So I have already posted how auto clicker was nerfed, that wasn't so much an issue as the events were, which became a distraction of the main task, which is for me 100% achievements So these events, while had some nice extras, really all they do is hold you back from doing what youo're supposed to be doing, and it adds up to 125hrs? to the whole dynamic, and yes it's become weekly I don't like how the game has changed so rapidly like things have just been added to please the few paying customers? I don't know and I am not accusing, but asking a question, it just feels that a minority here is being catered for, ie the paying player that can and will get what they pay for, which is obviously an advantage, it doesn't mean non paying players are at a disadvantage, it means that that aspect of the game is being neglected The game is designed to create revenue, cash cows it needs to move to fiscal targets to be succesful Most players (this is an opinion) do not spend money so the driving force of this game, you guessed it is money Devs can do what they want, as long as there is a way of 100% achievements without money, I am all good for that, what doesn't gell well is when devs change the focus of the game mid way, or early on and these changes affect in my eyes the monetary value of the game I will explain, certain things early on which people spent money on changed to where newer players could potentially have to spend more money on or less, given the dynamics have changed Not good Also the fact of the matter that these things should have been worked out in EA, not full release which makes spending money in this game a bit of a gamble, to which my last point's measure This game with money becomes a bit of a gamble as you really do not know what you're getting when you buy the packs, there is not enough consistancy as you cannot sell anything you acquire, other than the cards you get (this is the bonus), but one player might spend more money achieving the same results as another, to me which is too random /TL:DR oh well, such is life... __________________________________________________________________________ I will leave everything here, BUT add that the devs actually do care about their community If I could leave a nuetral review, I would, but alas I cannot There has been some toxic behaviour in threads which devs have stated that using an auto clicker is NOT against ToS The devs are right in posting this and posted due to concerns of the players that use an auto clicker...

"Early Access is a very handy tool for developers and for players who can try the game early on and possibly direct the game where they like best. Actually, seeing the progress of SmallSquirrel between the first and second games and very promising screenshots in the store, as well as reviews and comments, I decided to support them in RD. And in vain. In the RD there is something in the area of ​​the content prototype. Namely, 3 enemies, and each of them has 3 almost identical levels of Bullet Hell, 1 pose-art (in 4 variations differing in the degree of dress), 1 terrible Live2D animation in 3 speeds. Some fast gonzales complete the game in 16 minutes (I finished in 30). But this can be attributed to the RD. But 3 arts for the whole game is no longer early access, this is arrogance and refund.
