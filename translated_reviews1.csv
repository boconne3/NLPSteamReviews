"The story, which begins as a banal search for the missing son of the protagonist, develops, becomes something much more complex and full of ethical questions. As in Fallout: New Vegas, we find ourselves embroiled in a confrontation between several factions fighting for control of the region, and we decide which of their far from perfect philosophies to join, and which worldview to adopt. All this sometimes makes you press ""pause"" and think carefully about your potential choice. Even for joining the highly dubious Institute, one can find good reasons. And the later decision to leave them and go their own way was by no means as easy as I expected. In addition, I was almost shocked at the sympathy local villains can evoke - even the most inveterate killer, the scriptwriters managed to make a person with their own motives and remnants of humanity.

"First of all, I would like to thank the connoisseurs for sharing the KEY. At the beginning, I learned that this game originated from the heated discussion caused by the development team during the Modian crowdfunding two years ago. Since the beginning of crowdfunding, this game has been a controversial game work. It has been questioned by players because of copyright issues and the slow progress of game development. But like me, who have many memories of both the RGP version and the arcade version of ""Swallowing the World"", the post-90s generation is undoubtedly very excited to see high-definition fan works like ""Swallowing Kong Ming Chuan"" on steam. ""Swallowing Kong Ming Biography"" has eight chapters. In addition to some original lines, the plot has also been adapted from the original. The theme of the Three Kingdoms has always been a favorite of Chinese players, and it is undoubtedly exciting to conquer one after another legendary generals and fight in the Quartet. Although the core gameplay of the game is inherited from ""Swallowing Heaven and Earth"", the development of the main storyline and the subsequent capture of the generals in the wild are full of Japanese RPG flavors, but the rich and beautiful BGM of the game and the individual character dubbing of the generals fighting also do not reflect this work. High quality as an independent game. And many details, such as changing the climate as the scene switches, and the exclusive skills of each general, are also worthy of the players to savor. To be honest, with the increasing prosperity of the game market, more commercialization and fast-food, players have a variety of game choices, and this game is a traditional RPG that requires players to devote time to it. I hope you are approaching or stepping forward. The feelings of the player in the year, after life and work in this work to retrieve memories. Finally, a few suggestions: 1. I hope that the AI ​​can give priority to attacking the remaining blood enemies in the automatic battle. 2. The wandering route of the NPC in the city should not include a narrow terrain (it is often annoying for a team of people to be stuck in the terrain for a few seconds by an NPC) 3. The enemy rate is too high, and the explosion rate is very low. Without the incentive of equipment or item rewards, the player is easy to be annoyed by endless miscellaneous soldiers. ",True,False

The game is good, but I didn’t get involved. Its set price tag of 249 rubles, as for me, is a little too high. Personally, I got it for free during the promotion.

"Bot Colony is an ambitious title, aiming to provide a non-scripted story by allowing you to freely converse with robots. If you enjoyed literary works like 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep', Isaac Asimov's Robot series, movies like 'Space Oddysey 2001'(not one of my favorites though) or Anime like 'Ghost in the Shell' and 'Psycho-Pass', you'll find a similar setting here.  An important remark is that most of the gameplay is text (or speech) conversations, which at times can be both agitating and humorous, and that might not appeal to everyone.  Currently, the game is made of 2 episodes: Intruder and Arrival.   You have 2 objectives. The first one is erasing evidence of a thief breaking into the house, by commanding a robot (Jimmy). The other one is an investigation mission, which you can do at the same time, in which you question Jimmy about what happened at the house in the last 48 hrs. Jimmy will be saying some of his remarks/facts while moving around the house, which can be used as hints to what to ask. Although it might be a struggle at first, once you get used to commanding Jimmy (i recommend reading through  ). This is the first ""real mission"". it consists of multiple objectives that you'll discover while playing, talking with the receptionist, finding your luggage, , getting a ride to your next location. A memorable moment was the talk with Charlie, a cleaner bot who'll help you with getting your ride.     I enjoyed my playtime with BotColony and I'll be waiting for any further updates. If you have any interest on how the robots operate and your interaction with them, I'm sure you'll also enjoy it. While if you're only focused on 'the result' or why the robot isn't doing what you 'clearly' are telling it, you might have a rough ride. Keep also in mind that the game is an early access title, and not everything is polished yet. I played mostly through typing, Voice recognition is pretty decent with the new Microsoft API, but i find it more convenient to type. That said, voice recognition is not made by the developers and is one of the best available on the market. Also the devs like to hear community feedback, so feel free to drop your thoughts on the forums. ",True,True

"An 8/10 Game. If you are a Hack'N'Slash lover, this will be a great option. This game is a great creation, it is simply worth the full price, I had already tried it before it was on steam, in case I finished it before that is why I have not spent so much time on it, but at least it took about 30 hours game mine without getting bored. This game has Pros and Cons some of which would go like. Pros: ~ The game is very well designed ~ It has support for controllers from Xbox 360, Dualshock 3 and Dualshock 4 ~ An incredible gameplay, very varied. ~ Various upgrades for each type of attack or movement ~ A little story. ~ No loss is understandable at all times by watching the tutorial. Cons: ~ It does not have as many levels as expected, a big update is needed for more levels. ~ It does not have any multiplayer mode although this does not affect me especially, I am entertained equally. ~ Lacks balance when it comes to damage. In itself it is all the bad that I see, the rest is good, The Game is a great experience. ",True,False

"And I like the direction in which NSF is developing. Let MV and the underground remain in our heart. Since NSF 2015 is a very cool concept, the plot sags in places, but now I most of all get pleasure from high speeds, tuning of cars, which is more and more with each part. The sounds in this part are well chosen, there are 5 tracks that are direct VIN and I wait every time they play, and only 1 song is annoying, the rest are middle ones and are not even annoying, and there are 70+ tracks. Stable FPS at maximum speed, and as always, the NSF has excellent control. As established, the whole day rolled and the pleasure was received to the maximum. One of the drawbacks, races against people are implemented crookedly, there is no selection in terms of power, only drive with friends, or negotiate power, But how many I drove with random, people with top cars waited at the finish line and missed.

"Behind the uncomplicated facade of a little-known shooter originally from 2007, there is a good game with an interesting plot. Despite the simple plot - the old love Lydia comes to a prospector in years named Arnold Weiss, and asks to find out the fate of her beloved Warren (by the way, Arnie's best friend). At the mine where the specific mineral Hubbardium (named, apparently, after Ron Hubbard) is mined, an accident occurred, the connection was interrupted, and all attempts to get to the bottom of the truth were in vain. Taking his feet in hand, our hero goes to Alpha Prime in order to sort things out personally. However, upon arrival, it turns out that everything is far from simple. An elementary plot turns into a case in which each character stands his ground, accusing others, and it does not work to catch someone in a lie - all that remains is to move along the plot. Fortunately, the gameplay here is by no means experimental - a classic shooter with a dozen types of weapons, angry soldiers and corridor locations. Finding out more and more details of what happened, and getting more and more confused, Arnold Weiss travels around the station, destroying robots, special forces teams, and also workers who have lost their minds. And I must say, the enemies will not be merciful to old Arnold - first-aid kits are not honored on Alpha Prime, treatment machines are less common than the most valuable ore, and soldiers have no more handfuls of cartridges in their pockets. When choosing ""Hard"" at the beginning of the game, keep in mind that 100 health points evaporate faster than oxygen in the rarefied atmosphere of the planet. Even a couple of soldiers smoking peacefully in the cafeteria can become a serious obstacle to the goal. Fortunately, no one took away the player's ingenuity - you can throw a grenade around the corner, wait for the soldier to rush into battle, or throw in a Hubbardium, getting a sort of slow-mo (but not so effective - you can't count on the effect from Duty Calls worth it). However, in one thing it is more than useful - when you need to put a couple of bullets in the head from a long distance, and the cartridges, as they say, are left at the very bottom. There are also a couple of curious mechanics, working physics (you can remove the lids from the boxes, searching everything around), 1 extremely non-trivial level and, surprisingly, an excellent ending. The main plot intrigue was worth it, whatever one may say. The game is one playthrough, but at the same time it became a pleasant find in the bins of the library for the May holidays.

"People tend to speak up only when they are dissatisfied. Hope that more players who like the law of infinity will not be shy to praise. There are many bad games destroyed by the development team's arbitrariness. But there are too many good games that have been ruined by players because they are too weak. Of course, the Northern Lights have to let them know what they did wrong. Players who really like ROE will even make the noise more fierce and fierce than the spray. Let them understand where they are doing the right thing. For a game, it is more conducive to growth. I discovered very early that everything seems to be on par with PUBG from sideways. The ""egg shell"" on Miss Tiancha's head was also sprayed out by these sprays. From then on, the sweet little sister who emerged from the sight suddenly became a boy scout with a lid on her head. . . The character style is too bad. (If you don't understand, try to recall the approximate amount that you, the women around you, or the women around others pay for their hair and hats each year.) Are these sprays ""3D printers""? ! Just spray out what you want, right? Why don't you spray armor or light and shadow effects on the shield of Fortnite? . . At least when the northern lights issue an update announcement stating that special characters in the enemy's perspective will wear helmets. I have never fought against the Tanzi nor communicated with the opening team. I feel deeply sorry. Having said that, I would like to nominate a ""Best Developer Award"" for the update frequency of Northern Lights and the attitude of listening to opinions. It's a pity that there is no developer page in Steam, so I can't search the awards temporarily. . . Then I had to vote for the Polish stupid donkey. The hateful thing is that the sprayer is now jumping wildly around, planning to spray back the robot specially set up for novices. Are those novices with a KD ratio of a few tenths only worthy of being abused by veterans to enhance their gaming experience? Or are those anchors who are afraid that if they don't play the trumpet, they will not be able to abuse Mengxin and lose the program effect, so they are so anxious that they pull the brainstorming fans all over the world with rhythm? Or there are some speculative merchants who see that ROE does not open the market and want to spray players back to PUBG to increase the price of accessories? ""When I get better, I will go back."" This kind of determination is impossible for novices to possess. Many games racked their brains and are designed to be ""easy to learn but difficult to master"", isn't it just to increase positive feedback at the beginning of the game to retain newcomers? Recall that after GTA and the like have no fresh blood, they can only be maintained by their loyalty. How has the circle of domestic players shrunk into? What's more, the official said at the first time that there will be no robots when the technology improves! So isn't it just the recruits who can't wait to hold the gun and even take the wrong ammunition? Especially when I saw some remarks that I really want to cover my face when the robot is swiping around and revealing its position. First of all, I don't understand why the robot is brushing around. . . Where does this God theory come from? Will you become a living person or will all the robots on the Magneto map rush to you? Secondly, even if you expose yourself after killing the robot. But compared with death, novices also get some happiness and some positive feedback. The level of improvement for the technology in the early days of Cultivation is definitely far greater than that of a missed shot or death without a shot. I have never been able to understand the problem of turning sideways at first. Sideways behind the bunker is not enough. I have to make a fuss about getting the button back sideways. Is this function to twist and avoid headshots in the open space? Others say that you cannot turn sideways without leaning on the bunker. If time is really so urgent, there is still time to rely on bunker? Have you found the bunker and you still have to press W to move forward? To put it bluntly, it's not that the habit is not easy to change, and I want to press one more QE after the bunker, and everyone will suffer. . . This issue has also been mentioned in a post that has been replied by the official Northern Lights staff. Nowadays, no one mentions it after a long time. As mentioned at the beginning: If it is really angry and complaining, don't talk about it. Players who really like ROE are more troubled. The Northern Lights were very principled. The same are colored glasses. When the fan sees that it is Tencent, he can only see plagiarism and krypton gold. But what we found when we saw domestic production was a breakthrough and the tolerance that should be given to it! Finally, I will explain my very thin experience in battle royale games: PUBG is not interested at all. Battle Royale in Fortnite hasn't been played in Survival Mode for a long time. Although Realm Royale's eyes are bright, the follow-up is weak. The longest H1Z1 has only been played for more than 200 hours in total (Dawn, you pay back my hard-earned money!!) and then somehow entered the pit of the law of infinity. It's only two months since it opened, and it has played for more than 100 hours. Maybe the sprayer will say that you dare to use this data to represent other players as soon as you BR Xiaobai? I'm sorry I can't represent it alone. But at least the Law of Infinity made me, a player who has never had a cold on Battle Royale, attracted and stayed here. This is my feelings for the Northern Lights, who has never played Tianya Mingyue Knife. After dinner, I worked overtime until five o'clock in the morning. Now my head is stunned by the smoke and I can't move too much. Don't care too much about rhetoric and paragraphs. A few lines of remarks are concise and not so tactful. I'm too busy at work and I really don't have time to be a navy so I'm not afraid of being sprayed. As long as IQ is talking online, it’s okay for me to copy the replies into this text. ",True,True

"Despite the fact that over the last few years, many titles with a ""truck"" theme have appeared on the market, the anticipation of the premiere of Euro Truck Simulator 2 was accompanied by real tension, additionally boosted by further postponements of the debut date. I am not an avid ""trucker"" myself, but I have made shorter or longer romances with many similar productions, starting from the legendary Hard Truck 2. ETS 2 has got on the list of games that I just have to start especially thanks to the coolly realized Trucks & Trailers and this year's Scania Truck Driving Simulator. And although ETS 2 is not a revelation for the genre in general, this title has many advantages that will be appreciated by all those who love driving a truck. When you start Euro Truck Simulator 2 for the first time, the most noticeable thing is the vast map, with a really dense network of roads and highways. It ranges from Great Britain, through France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia to Poland. Some countries were treated a bit neglectively - for example, Italy or Poland are only three cities and a few roads, but also good. Individual countries differ in terms of the appearance of the roads and the climate, but there are no diametrical differences between them - maybe except for Great Britain, which of course we move on the left side of the road, which is a nice diversion for a person living in the country with traffic on the right. In my opinion, cities are a bit disappointing - huge metropolises at best resemble small towns and consist of a dozen or so roads; fortunately, they were not created based on the same patterns as in previous games of this genre, so we do not drive clone cities that differ only in names. And fortunately, because it would probably be too powerful, though not the only blow to realism inflicted by the ETS 2. For example, when driving through the Kłodzko Valley towards the Czech Republic, I did not feel completely different than driving the Poznań - Szczecin route, and yet the characteristics of the area and the surrounding landscape should be radically different. Therefore, as a result, I started to wonder if I would prefer, instead of several countries, one, maybe even fictional, but rendered in a really detailed way - mountains and valleys, forests and deserts, lakes and rivers, highways, national roads and small, forgotten passages between only a few , but well-prepared and dedicated cities ... But of course that's just my dream. :) ",True,False
"Purity without a touch of vulgarity and platitude. Hatred without restrictions of common sense. Love without saccharine. A few distinct personalities, caught in the circumstances or making their own mistakes. Which tragedies will they have to face? How will they overcome or succumb? This story has its unique charm and style. Outstanding visuals and fitting music, blending in with the story. The characters are well-written and alive. The text on its own has a great language. This story is filled with beautiful sayings and events. It has quite a share of surprises and sudden moments which will catch you off guard. It's a long game and I'd prefer the last chapter to be shorter. After the promise of the final closure, I was waiting far too long for it to actually happen. Some music tracks are way too repetitive, especially the happy ones. And even though I really like the way how it's written, the amount of ""......"" is sometimes too annoying. In the end I liked this game, I liked this story. And I really liked some of the characters who felt like good acquaintances of mine in the end.  I picked up this game because of it being constantly called ""the best visual novel on Steam"". I finished it looking at all the entangled threads being tied together in a single picture.

"One of the best indie games I've played in a long time. You are quickly thrown into the game and after the first 3 minutes of play you have full freedom of choice. This game attracts you quickly and has the potential to be played for several hours in a row, but it is also perfect for ""in between times"". Music and graphics are consistent and despite the pixel graphics, it looks chic with shaders and effects. For the price I give a clear buy recommendation, I bought it for less than 2 euros. The map is very large and you are not limited in terms of creativity when it comes to your own pirates or the ship. There is complete freedom of choice over names and looks. Even if the soundtrack is consistent and the noises match the game, they can appear annoying for a long time. At some point, the high-pitched pirate voices only produce a high-pitched and annoying tone if you select several at once. Another minus point are the successes / achievements. Many of them are bent and do not activate themselves, although all tasks have been completed several times. (It wasn't just me) One of the achievements was unfortunately tied to Christmas and can no longer be unlocked. Despite small mistakes, the game offers a convincing pirate feeling and a multifaceted atmosphere. The world is packed with little secrets and exciting encounters.

There are many little things that you have to pay attention to. E.g. with the clue you can see if there are other players nearby when it lights up in red instead of white. What I find so awesome about Hunt is that there are different methods of killing the many zombies. Mugs must not be struck with the blade, or you should find axes at the bosses or burn them with the lamps. All in a nutshell: Very ingenious game where people really made an effort and thought!

"It was 2015, June 4th. I decided to launch this masterpiece. I immersed myself in this game. I went to the Zahaditi card. And there was a big town and a 2nd person. I decided to ask where you can buy an apartment for a thing. And in response to me - we plowed for me, I will pack. And I was shocked at what a beautiful semi-glass skyscraper. He turned out to be a VIP and I had to give him 3 things for all my money. I settled in, there was no bed or furniture, for that VIP, I lie like this on the glass floor, a cleaning lady came to me to clean and told me. - Uhadi atsudava, I left to clean up. She was blonde, polygonal boobs, ass and head. When I left the room, I went into it and I liked her empty head. I asked her to get married and she agreed. Here comes the wedding and suddenly comes a knight in a blue and yellow suit and her brother in a black knight suit. I was scared, suddenly a woman who looked like a bum came and began to speak her phrases. And she asks - You saglasin to marry Marya Ivanuvna? I breathed and said yes, she began to beat me with a pickaxe and I yelled, And this family of Ivynuvs began to hammer at me and said: -hadi bistra mi tibya neither loved me tibya schA banim. And then I could not escape some bum who was given to build, I leveled a hole of 2 cubes, I fell into it. The Ivanuvny began to beat me on the head with a pick and I died.

"Wow, just like I expected I just really love RhinoGearz Visual Novels. The writing, story telling and just in general how he likes to form romance stories and relationships just really fits with my own personal likings. You play a young guy entering a magic academy and finding the love of your life in it. The relationship development is really nice and I also really enjoyed the overall story apart from the romance itself. Considering that you also get around 4 hours of story and that it is only 2 euro, I will never understand why his games dont take off more. For this price you wont find anything better on steam when it comes to romance VNs and just overall positive story telling.  If you are looking for a positive and very relaxing read then highly recommended. There is no r18 content though so if you are looking for that you might want to look elsewhere. If you care about story though and not just visuals then its really great.

"1. I'll start my article with the fact that the game is now driven only by donat. In all senses, I start from imbalance, ending with the fact that this game is developed for the sake of donators (thank God, at least somehow) 2. I would not say that this is a clone of total influence, the engine is one .... but the game is played in a completely different way. 3. Lots of small chips and constant promotions. 4. Sufficient flexibility of the gameplay, unlike total influence, where everything was done at random. (or vice versa too difficult) 5. Unbalanced ranks. In the beginning, guys with machine guns worship, then grenade launchers to rank 3. and so constantly on a curve. there is something better at every rank than you have. 6. play no more than 2 snouts, otherwise the coordination of actions is worse than that of bots. 7. few players online or all players are at certain ranks. From which it follows that it is difficult to meet at least someone, for example a rank of 3. Well, this is in short. comparing all this, I can say one thing, everything is in the hands of developers. Either it will be a donat that sets the ass on fire to a prolitaria, or something mundane with a Danat as in HERE. Well ... and I advise you to familiarize yourself. ",True,False

"My rating for the game - 7.0 Duration of the main plot ~ 10 hours No story Dlc - Visual series - 6.5. The graphics are average here as for 2012. Not bad in places, but more often soap. In addition, here, as in most games of that time, there is a filthy Bloom effect; -Gameplay - 8.0. An action-packed shooter with a cover system, ""tactical elements"" and ""run for space"" - this is perhaps the most comprehensive characteristic. The shooting mechanics are really not the most pleasant, but the shootings here are competently diluted with chases, ""peaceful locations"" and other activities. There is also a rather pleasant mechanic of shooting limbs to robots, like the one that was previously presented in Dead Space; -Plot - 6.5. In general, the plot is interesting, although never original and completely linear. But this is usually the norm for shooters. Everything is served cool, of course, the production and direction are at their best. There are interesting twists, good humor and, albeit very primitive, but communication with partners at the ready with the system of their loyalty to you; -Sound and music - 7.0. I did not find anything remarkable in the sounds. It is fully consistent with the genre and status of the game. But the music is solid and sets the pace for the game well. But for some reason it was made very quiet here, and the ability to adjust its volume was not added. DLC's: there are only 2 dlc's in the game and they are clearly not worth attention. • The first adds content for multiplayer, which is not and which is not needed in this game; • In the second, a number of improvements to the abilities of the GG and his gun. That in principle does not have much influence on the single. Bottom line: the game is a typical mediocre third-person shooter for those years. I disagree with the fact that many call it undervalued. Rather, it was simply not in demand at that time (like Spec Ops: The Line, for example). In 2012, a lot of games were released that were more interesting and of higher quality (for example, Max Payne 3). The game can be safely taken without dlc. The closest similar games are Spec Ops: The Line and Max Payne 3 of the same years, as well as Gears of War (2006). ",True,False

"Old, but not lost its relevance. The game offers us several modes that have long become classics for games of this genre, namely: Capturing and holding points, destroying objects and .. that's it. Well, actually, what did you expect from the 2005 game? There are player-created servers, but here the variety of gameplay may surprise you. However, another component of the game is the system of classes, each of which has its own key role on the battlefield: Some are designed for close combat, others are most effective at long distances. And each has its own peculiarity, whether it be covering the comrades-in-arms with a smoke screen or an extremely high rate of fire that allows you to treat the enemy with lead just at the speed of a schoolboy flying on Friday from the last lesson to his computer. In short, you will find something to do on the battlefield. It differs from its original in more pleasant graphics (it's clear, the resource did its job), the class system and other small amenities. Regarding online: I can't say for sure, because I have met harsh guys more often than representatives of our generation. It doesn't bother me much, it even amuses me a little. Outcome: What can I say? Classics, and nothing more. There is a goal of the game, there are classes for achieving the corresponding goal, there are also enemies that must be killed. With graphics, everything is bearable, unless you are a capricious graphomaniac. Cards are sometimes striking in their size, which also involuntarily raises a smile. Immersion in a military atmosphere is guaranteed. If you find money, take it, but I would advise you to buy the game at a discount, because time also does not spare this creation (namely, it is online) and therefore it would be better not to risk it.

The hero can gain experience to increase his level, earn gold, buy and collect items that enhance it or give additional abilities. Each player constantly receives a small amount of gold from his base, and also earns small portions of gold for killing enemy creatures and large portions for killing heroes. Teams are scattered along the lines, on which there is a fight against enemy heroes and squads of creeps under the control of a computer, which appear at the command bases every half a minute.

"At first, cute and tube turns gradually into a fierce brain removal. For many. Probably. I'll tell you what, from the very beginning of this game it was clear that there would be some kind of fierce psychedelic. And so it happened, and it's not bad.

First, she will invite a child to visit her, then there will be dialogues that will ultimately come down to the theme of suicide and morality about the fact that the devil is in everyone. And what we see at first glance, sweet, friendly and innocent, can only be our ideas and first impressions. This shows that we can be wrong in those moments in which we could be 99% right.

"To be honest, after the failure of the Cartel (which I, due to the setting change and bad reviews, did not even play), I did not expect much from Call of Juarez Gunslinger. Developers' experiments with graphic style were also alarming. It was all in vain. Firstly, the game not only largely repeats the style of the first two parts of the series, but also has several pleasant innovations in the gameplay (storytelling style, pumping system, small and quite appropriate QTEs). With graphics, too, complete order - in Techland have always been able to make a great picture. And this time in addition to it, we also get excellent optimization and colorful atmospheric styling. The game is a bit short, but this is not a flaw at all, as it actually has 14 chapters, so make the developers longer, and the game could become already drawn out. So good in moderation! In addition, the game has a very high replay value - it is interesting to pass the same missions for the second and third time. Pros: + Interesting plot and excellent presentation, moderately seasoned with jokes. + The atmosphere of the wild west is perfectly revealed. + High quality graphics and great optimization. + The level design is very varied and pleasing to the eye. + Great soundtrack. Cons: - Localization with subtitles - very often the narration goes during active shootings, so it's simply impossible to keep up with reading the subtitles. This is very disturbing. In general, I really liked this rather sad, too ""fabulous"", but no less true, and completely not drawn out story told by an old tramp in a half-empty saloon. 9.5 out of 10 ",True,False
"I played this game with a friend and honestly, its a blast! Being infected is really fun as well as being non-infected. There is usually great teamwork between players and people are usually pretty chill (in my experience). There are skins that you can obtain for free which look nice. If you want to win, it is necessary to use good teamwork and this is what I like about the game. Lastly, I just love the animation where you transform into your 'beast form', its really cool xP There are some graphical errors I have found.  ex. If you go to the steam overlay and back into the game, your mouse cursor does not disappear and is just on the screen when you are in the first person perspective playing the game. ",True,False

"I rummaged around in the shop and then saw. The reviews weren't bad, so I put it in the shopping cart and it should be off. I actually only bought it for a little fun in between, just paddling around a bit when my head is on vacation (even a blonde wants to have a vacation;)). So first of all, I couldn't play the game at all. I wanted to start it and was then processed with a white screen, there was a bit of music to be heard in the background, but: Of course, no gamer is happy :( [For everyone who also has the problem: -> to the .exe file and start via ""integrated graphics card"".] When I had fixed the problem after all the tinkering, it started. I started with the story of BattleBlock. And it took about 2 minutes and I was totally crush on the voice of the narrator. And the comments during the levels - just brilliant. I absolutely have to mention the music. You can hear some melodies and they have a rhythm that you have to go along with :) ... Then If you wiggle in front of the PC during the Gems hunt and then look straight away at what the song of the level was called (here's an example [of course only to my liking]:). The game took me about 2.5 hours already completely convinced. The attraction of getting an ""A ++"" is always there. Then you play a level 5 times, so that there is a plus behind the A twice. It's a bit like school, 1st grade ... You really want a bee on the dictation from the German teacher! One is not satisfied with a ""good"" and a frog! I don't want to reveal too much, just that I give one for it. For me it is already one of my favorites. You will be surprised in any case and have 100% fun with it. :) ",True,False

"I'll start by saying I generally don't play hidden object games, the sheer number of them in the market and the fact that so many of them seem to look the same always made me feel like I wouldn't enjoy them.  I was convinced to play this one, though, and I'll admit that I was pleasantly surprised.  None of the puzzles or challenges were too difficult, but even so, there was enough variety that it kept me entertained through to the end (though I did miss the 4 hour time limit for the achievement by about 15 minutes, which meant I had to play through a second time). The only issue I had was during nearly every puzzle, I found myself backing out of them by clicking too close to the bottom of the screen for one reason or another, which did get annoying after a while.  Even after playing the game for hours I didn't seem to be getting any better when it came to this, maybe something like a back arrow somewhere on the screen as an alternative to clicking on the bottom portion to backtrack could help with that.  This is a pretty small complaint though, and most likely something that most people don't have any problems with. ",True,False

"Finished the game,  if you're a Korra fan  if you're not. + Combat is fun it's your basic 'Beat'em Up' + Concepts are interesting & lets you try different things than just montonous combat + Lots of secrets to find if you're into that kind of thing + Skill shop so fighting is completely repetitive + Story is interesting enough to intice the Korra fans to keep playing + Cutscenes are cool and fully animated + Pro.Bending. - There's only like a total of 10 models in this game - Little to nill replayability - Combat is a little choppy at times (not exactly fluid & smooth) - Can't fluently change from one bending to another unless in avatar state It's worth the 15 bucks if you like the Legend of Korra series & you've followed up for the last 2 seasons. So the combat is fun & simplistic, you just beat people to a pulp and move to the next segment. They make it feel really good to counter and throw back punches. Naga running segments is essentially like a runner-mode where you slip and slide through obstacles to get to the next segment, and though it's fun it feels a bit contrived. However, the enemies get stale after awhile there's like 10 models and 3 different palette swaps for each one. However, I do keep in mind that kind of budget the developers were probably working with and can empathize the constriction on the lack of diverse enemies/help from an AI. For a license game The Legend of Korra does alright to stand on its own considering the game is only 15 bucks, but most likely confusing to those who haven't seen the show. *****WARNING: SPOILERS/SECRET CODES BEYOND THIS POINT****** In case you do buy the game I've got some goodies: (note I'm using generic commands since everyone's layout is different) ",True,False

"This is how it happened… This is how the Batman die. One of the best games in the series. The most dramatic, the most emotional, unforgettable. The night that loomed over Gotham will not end. And the night is full of fears and dangers, but Batman is ready to challenge again and go to the end. ""That's how it happened… That's how Batman died…"" The spooky words of the narrator, at the beginning, set the appropriate atmosphere, and adds to the seriousness of the infernal hell of vodka, which burns the body of the Joker in the crematorium. The antagonist died. The final fat dot… can it be a coma? Darkness covered the city, which the procurator hated so much… But this is from another opera, We will not meet Dvulyky this time. However, there will be enough scary moments. From the epigraph screensaver itself, we will plunge into a calm, at first glance, cafe. Where would you sit and drink coffee and watch the funny visitors, but who is there hooliganizing at the end of the hall? Another smoker decided to drink a little? And well, my friend! .. Holy cow! And a quiet cafe turns into a battlefield. This is how chaos begins. Yes, the city plunges into the night. And those who remained in Gotham, do not envy. The scarecrow will give everyone a good time to taste the nightmares, to feel all the aromas of horror. Moreover, there will be enough rubbish to help him in this. A figure in black watches this ugliness from the roofs of houses and skyscrapers. His night watch is just beginning. And this long night will last a long time, will keep in tension until the near dawn. Such is the fate of the dark knight. The plot of further events will develop in a flash and epic. The adult world of serious male conversations. A bonus and a pleasant gameplay moment in this game is, of course, an updated and mega-functional batmobile. This wheelbarrow has already been pumped and pumped well! Many game moments are connected with it. Dangerous Gotham streets on it will be much safer to move. Moreover, it is full of various criminals who are trying to test the strength of your nerves and your fists. Although some will still swallow dust under the wheels of your Batmobile. With the development of the plot it becomes more and more interesting, well-known antagonists will meet, various persecutions, races, quests, riddles will not let you get bored. And, of course, amused by the appearance of a dead, but still crazy, Joker - his conversations, he will not let Batman miss. Without this green-haired clown in a purple suit, the dark knight would not be the uncompromising fighter for the truth as we know him. Warner Bros. and Rocksteady Studios did their best to present the DC Comics universe in a game that successfully held the bar of previous games in the series and led the franchise to a logical and memorable outcome. DLC add the opportunity to play for other characters, also entertain other costumes and add a traditional element of competition in certain trials. Special mention should be made of the optimization of the PC version of the game. At the time of release, it was poorly optimized and, unlike consoles, had problems: sagging fps, crash games and more. This is described in detail by other users in their reviews. I was a little lucky and on the previous video card (MSI GeForce GTX 580 Lightning) I had no problems with the game. Yes, fps in dynamic scenes sagged to 15-18 frames, but mostly the game was 32-45 frames and did not fly, so at high settings, the game went smoothly. Well, in a few months, the developers have finalized the PC version of the game and released a patch, so the negative feedback has become much less. Now the game is cheaper than three years ago, when it came out, and during the sales the price is also very nice. I recommend to buy and enjoy. P.S. And of course, it would be a crime not to mention the original voice acting of the characters - flawlessly and professionally! And Mark Hamill, who voiced the Joker, is just a genius! Not only will Luke Skywalker be remembered for his performance, but the Joker's unique and recognizable voice will long be associated with him.

The only problem is that it already has a gameplay system that is a bit rough, or not very polished, fortunately these problems were fixed in the next witcher.

"One of my top 5 most played games in my steam library! The sounds, the scenery, the players and the different maps make this game really well-made. There are many opportunities that you can make so even after long hours it won't be boring unlike other games, because you can play as Squad Lead, Infantry, Tank operator, Scout, Pilot or simply Support (logistics and/or super FOB-ing with TOWs and mortars). Not to mention the multiple factions with their own weapons, vehicles, tools and buildings respectively. If you wanted to compare with other games, I would say a really realistic game as Escape from Tarkov (no hitmarks), open-world with vehicles as Arma 3, respawn system and customization as in Red Orchestra and Rising Storm series, but if you just want to kill everyone because you are used to the fast paced CoD series, then this game is not for you: a map can take up to 1,5 hours!

"I really enjoy Telltale games so I'm always on the lookout for similar games and The Descendant is about as close as it gets, albeit less refined. The voice work was a little rough in parts, ranging from serviceable to good depending on the character and the visuals while nothing special did the job, they went for the cel shaded look ala The Walking Dead and co. Gameplay was what you'd expect, walk around finding clues, press the correct button at the correct time and select whichever story choice you prefer. Now for the bad though, it's technically not great (is this genre cursed?), it's a Unity engine game that's capped at 30fps, you have to edit the registry to fix this which is easy enough to do but you'll notice straight away the game is optimised for 30fps, even on medium settings I couldn't hit 60fps in all situations (although to be fair, I did most of the time).

"The game does not have a second ending, and currently there is only a single ending that can be played. But the most curious thing is that there is a closed door in ""Guanluoyin"". Could it be the branch door for another ending? I have no way of knowing this. Even if I walked back on the long corridor that ""faced my heart"", I couldn't leave that long corridor and couldn't go back to the two doors. Do you have any plans to launch DLC in the future? The player needs to operate the protagonist ""Du Fengyu"", understand the current situation of the family through some letter descriptions and some small puzzles, and trigger the event by walking simulation, and then slowly dig out the hidden ""home"" The unbearable truth that is difficult to face. The puzzles of the game are not difficult, and the puzzles are very easy to solve. You don't need to spend too much time and brainpower on the puzzles, so that people can concentrate on the plot experience. Of course! The game will have some scary sections, which will scare you away! There are also some curious actions that stimulate your perception nerves. If you dare not play, don't force it! PS. The only lighting equipment in the game-a lighter, please make good use of it, because some scenes are very dark. As a horror game, horror elements are necessary and one of the characteristics and selling points of this game. First of all, it must be said that the horror atmosphere created by the game is really excellent. It can completely make people feel the psychological pressure brought out by the game atmosphere. This game is really successful. The only scary technique, I personally feel that there is room for improvement. The game uses ""jump scare"" to achieve the effect of fright. It may be a sense of fright for players who are afraid of playing horror games, but for players who play a lot of horror games. It can't produce any effect on it, not that it can't be used, but if it is used too many times, it will make people feel insensible, or even meaningless. If you can slowly pave, brew, and use the ""stamina"" generated by the environment and the plot to bring the player's back to the cold and the creeps, this will not be comparable to more jump scares. . ↑ Just a few minutes after the game started, Xiao Hong Umbrella will give you a note of Mawei. It is undeniable that this frightening effect is very impressive! The scene design of this work is very reminiscent of the time in Taiwan at that time. It is like participating in a nostalgic retro exhibition in the 80s. It makes people feel ""nostalgic"" for an object or photo, whether it is old mottled floor tiles or placed on chairs. The ""Lele"" snacks on the table, the ""Dadong brand"" refrigerator has many X's on it, the home wall has photos of the age, the contact book signed by myself, the bathtub of the ""grandma's house"" in the bathroom, and the dark corridor wall is covered with The leaflets and spells of the game, even TV shows and commercials, are perfectly reproduced. Everything in this game is really remarkable. The exquisite modeling really makes the eyes bright and really makes People were amazed and thanked the red candle production team for their hard work. ↑ The bathtub of ""Grandma's House"" that exists in childhood memories is also restored! The soundtrack in the game is also quite standard. With the introduction of horror atmosphere music, players can be more integrated and immersed in this dark and horrible scene. The sound effects are also quite restored. In the game, you can hear the nostalgic ""tweeting"" bird calling the door bell, the uncle's announcement of ""repairing screen windows, screen doors, changing glass"" outside the window, as well as ""small balls"" and ""cups"". The nursery rhyme of ""Moon Kai"", etc... I personally feel that the soundtrack of the ending ""returns"", coupled with the scene of sister Maxim’s running forward, unable to catch up with her and leaving you, is the most amazing in this work This is also the most cruel link. I believe all players think so, right? The dubbing is national, and the overall dubbing is great and vivid. Especially when the parents quarreled, I personally think that the interpretation is very vivid, without any sense of violation. There is also the stage of Guanluoyin, the sound performance of pain and fear is quite admirable! This game also indirectly proves that Taiwan still has good voice talents, right? The hostess on TV. Personally, I feel that the picture book suddenly became a 2D style of expression and ""Maxim’s Little Theater"", which allows the player to become a red dragon in a fish tank, and indirectly understand how Maxim lives and what he is thinking about. Thinking is really creative. In addition to these, there are also changes in the card scene, which also make people feel supernatural, such as ""the room full of tulips"", which is really worth savoring! I am very pleased that the Red Candle Game Production Team has once again created a horror masterpiece that goes international and integrates Taiwan's folk customs. It feels really good to present the game with a 3D screen this time, but the game time is too short, it can be played in three to four hours, and it feels uninteresting. In the end, I didn't see the actual situation of Maxim's behind that door as I wished. Although I generally know what happened, it still makes people a little disappointed. I personally think that the performance of this work is not back to school, but it still makes me very amazing! You are indeed making progress, come on! Looking forward to the next new work, I highly recommend everyone who likes to play horror games! If there is a DLC that can hit the He Shen stick, I will definitely buy it without saying a word! It’s really hateful to use the misfortune of others to make oneself earn money! Belief in religion is not to say no, you can take this to seek solace, but everything must be treated rationally. Don’t be too blind and superstition to hurt your money, or even cause the tragic situation of family destruction. This is really not worth it. ",True,False

"A true gem for the Star Wars saga. The story of Cal Kestis is excellently delivered as themes of pain, guilt, regret and fear are explored. A likeable cast of characters accompany the protagonist on his epic journey across the Star Wars galaxy, from more well known planets like Kasshyyk, the home of the Wookies, to Dathomir, the shrouded home of Darth Maul, Savage Opress and Asajj Ventress as featured in The Clone Wars and Rebels. The Inquisitors are excellent antagonists for this story as well as the beautiful musical score, reminiscent of John Williams iconic pieces for the movies.

"This is the first time I think a game has hooked me so much. Getting this game about 4 days ago, and putting almost 10 hours a day into it, is a worrying amount, but the game just hooks you. It all comes down to some basic aspects that make this game so good, from a gameplay standpoint: The movement and the weapons. The movement is pretty simple, you run around as you might expect, but the dash is really what makes it. Its far enough to get some distance and dodge if you need to, but is also great for when you want to jump around enemies to backstab them, or fighting multiple enemies, jumping from one to another as you see fit. The movement is simple enough for anyone to use, but also allows people with fast hands to really take advantage of some of the games mechanics. The movement puts you in a position where you can be almost perfectly in control of how much damage you take. I think that it has hit a very nice balance. The combat is in a word, satisfying. With a number of different weapons, and a number of different play styles available for each, it really opens the game out with what you can do. The boons and upgrades that you get can also be attributed for this, giving different bonuses, which can compound certain playstyles, or make you switch up your build a little bit for something more fun. The point is, there are loads of different options for you to choose from. Most of the weapons specials, are slower and higher damaging attacks, and when you get that killing blow with them, it does feel good to do so. I think that's what makes the combat so good and keeps me playing so much. *POTENTIAL SPOILERS BELOW* Outside of the gameplay, the story and mini-stories had me wanting to keep playing too, due to the way in which it is revealed to you. Throughout the game, you find out more about Zagreus' mother, what happened between her and Hades, and the change of characters thoughts and attitudes. However there are tons of other character interactions throughout the game that you can take part in, from simply chatting with people in the House or those within the different areas of the Underworld, and being able to give gifts to those same characters in return for some goodies for you to use. Not only are these interactions fun and interesting to do, to find out more about these characters, and how they interact with the others around them.  I think the revealing nature of the story, really kept me motivated to keep playing, as I really wanted to reach the end, beat Hades and see Persephone again, to keep learning more about what happened. *END OF SPOILERS* Overall, I am more than pleased with the story(ies) and its execution. It's great that you can get as invested into them as you like through your choices of who to talk to and who to care about. I have only reached the end of the main story so far, but I am very satisfied with it. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I think that this is a game that many people will enjoy, even those who, like me, was never really into rogue-likes at all. I would definitely recommend to everyone. ",True,False

"An excellent game with a unique and entertaining combat system, wonderful art design and a motif built from a diverse array of myths and cultures. However the game isn't perfect, I've had my fare share of crashes (ALWAYS SAVE BEFORE ALT-TABBING!) and there are a few boss fights where it feels like the game isn't being fair or clear on what it wants me to do. Also there are a few characters that feel (to me at least) like duds, but in a roster of 20+ characters they cant all be winners and with so many options I'm sure anyone can find at least 2 they like enough to stick with to the end.

"I got this game for 50 euros or so, i preordered it, and I think it's worth of it. Main story is made to be played in about 15 hours or so. The game has some bugs, but not much. Now let's talk about ratings. 1. Graphics Graphics are incredible, a lot of details, great looking cut scenes, enemies have a lot of details, even on lower spec computers. I have mid-high tier computer, and i could play game on 40fps on some great medium settings. 2. Gameplay (combat, jumping, side task, main missions, RPG stuff...) Combat is the most important thing in this game and it's soo ♥♥♥♥*** great, i could even say incredible. Yes it has a small number of bugs but these bugs are irellevant and I passed game without any problems. I saw some bugs in dodging, i mean, sometimes i click dodge button, in my case its CTRL and usually it works, i mean almost always works, maybe it won't work in 1/50 times so it's doesn't matter. Second most important gameplay feature is parkour or jumping, in this game it has a lot of jumping, flying enemies so you have to jump to hit them etc... The parkour is most important in last mission with cap America and it's done great. Sometimes I had problems with Caps wall running but with newer patches it was fixed. Parkour mehanics are simple, with cap you have wall-running, with Miss Marvel and Black Widow you have some kinda hands/grapple hooks that you throw on the ground or tree/pipe... Hulk has simple jumping. Thor and Ironman don't have any parkour mehanics, simple jumping with flying. Side task and main missions are important in every game, same as in Marvel's Avengers, so let's begin. First mission is tutorial and it is showing how to play with every single hero. Personally i like these type of level design, looks like design from God of War (2018). If you have to jump on something or destroy it, it has some kind of a mark, white stripes, red colour on it... When you use tactical awareness, it shows you current objectives and some kind of a soul that shows where you should go. Missions are usually of same kind. Go destroy more enemies, stay in some circle and let Jarvis (your supercomputer) to hack doors, go to elevator destroy some enemies, stop reactor or hack communication or take over defence... There are 2 ways of doing that, capturing zones and guarding them from AIM destroying some kind of generators and stop reactor/engine... RPG stuff is a great part of the game, level rising, gears, gear upgrading, artefacts, skill points... It reminds me of an Assasin's Creed game. There's not much to say it's good, noob friendly and simple. 3. Story I love it. It's good kinda story, i liked it, and enjoyed it. The only thing that i didn't like is introducing new Avenger Khamala Khan (Miss Marvel) but on the other side of the coin, story is very good and enjoyable. I won't spoil it but i recommend to finish the main story, it remains one BIG cliffhanger. There are a lot of cut scenes, with my free guess about a 45 minutes of cut scenes and so. Really enjoyable story. 4. Conclusion If you have 45+ euros to give for game, I would reccomend you to buy it, but you will need a good computer (a lot better than minimum specs). I had 2 PCs, one was with minimum specs other one was with a recommended specs, game runned very badly on the min spec PC but on the one with  a reccommended, runned very well. The game is great and if you are Marvel fan buy it, you won't regret it. If you wanna play multyplayer fell free to add me. ",True,False

"Playway has really done a great job with this one. I enjoyed CMS2014 but they managed to build on that and improve it in almost every way. And all with Kickstarter and a low pledge goal. As the name implies you run an auto shop repair business. But new and improved for 2015 are the cars have many more parts now and the repairs are a good deal more involved. You also earn XP now as you work and complete jobs which can be used to unlock more advanced diagnostic tools like the test path, OBD scanner, compression tester etc and other repair abilities.  There is also an unlockable paint shop now as well so you can do body and paint work and an auction house where you can buy junk cars for parts or fix them up and sell them for profit. Once you earn enough to get the extra parking lot, you can store your cars for service or just collect them. Customers call in on the phone with jobs you can take or decline. An all new better organized parts shop and tablet access eliminates running back and forth to the computer to buy parts. Test driving the vehicle now and using your diagnostic tools generates a parts list condition report for certain systems saving you time poking around and disassembling the vehicle looking for bad parts. All in all there's quite a bit to do and highly recommended if you like puzzle games, working on cars, or are a simulator fan. ",True,False

"Compared to the second generation, I think Company of Heroes 1 is more classic. From the main body of the company of heroes to the resistance front to the legend of courage, it can be said that they are full of green memories. It’s a good idea to play with PY at home during the holidays. It’s mainly because it doesn’t eat configuration, it is more popular, and the picture quality is good. At present, I recommend that you directly enter the legend of courage, you can experience all the content except the first two battles, it is very suitable for online, of course, the campaign party can pass this. Regarding the company of heroes, there are two camps, one is the old beauty, which is the Allied camp, and the other is the old Germany, which is the axis camp. The first expansion piece resists the front line, the Allies joined the British, and the Axis joined the armored division. The second expansion piece The Legend of Courage, in addition to fixing some well-known bugs, joined the battle of the Tiger Tank and other battles. The skin of the style tank is also the end of the first generation, with relatively good balance. Let's talk about mod. There are so many excellent mods for Company of Heroes 1. For example, Blitz is extremely comprehensive. The author’s creative principle is to pursue authenticity. The current evaluation is the highest, and the playability is very high, but it is also ridiculed as a crispy warfare. Everyone has played and understood by themselves. Company of Heroes has joined the Soviet camp in the European battlefield. Many more are not listed here. If you are interested, you can check and download by yourself. In short, Company of Heroes 1 is a very good game. Online with friends, PY transaction... ",True,False

"Friends who like civilized + fantasy style strategy games should not miss it. Compared with the two recent fantasy 4X games, EL wins in excellent details and good micro-management management. Let’s briefly introduce it with 4X elements as the classification: 1. Exploring (eXlore): Just like sending scouts to open maps at the beginning of Civilization 5, EL also needs to explore various relics, fight against the wild, and find various strategic resources and luxury goods. However, EL has added heroes, missions, and season settings, adding a lot of RPG features and playability to the game: (1) The beta version temporarily provides 4 races, each with its own unique heroes, divided into There are three types of long-range, melee, and support. Heroes of different races have different skill trees, but the development classification is very clear. They are divided into three parts: internal affairs, exploration, and combat, which can be selected and matched according to the player's strategic needs. At the same time, the game also provides a paper doll system for the hero, which can be equipped with various equipment from head to toe, but powerful equipment requires the support of different strategic resources and technology. The hero will not die, the defeat will appear in the war academy, you need to wait a long round before you can recruit again. (2) Each race has different main quests, and various random side quests will appear in the exploration. After completion, not only can you get various rewards, but you can also deepen your understanding of the ethnic background. (3) The game is divided into seasons. When winter comes, the output of food and money will be reduced. At the same time, the movement speed of the troops will be halved, and the vision will be reduced. Different seasons need to adopt different internal management and strategic goals. 2. Expansion (eXpand): The game map is divided into different administrative provinces. Each province can only be used by one race to build a city. This city will enjoy the bonus of the entire region's resources, which is to avoid the dense clusters of civilized AI While chaotic shop, it also emphasizes the importance of EL's exploration of strategic resources and timely expansion, which will also cause more tension in diplomatic relations. Although cities will get the strategic resources and luxury goods of the entire province, the location where each city is built is still very important, because the number of grids in each city is fixed at the beginning, and each grid produces food according to different terrains. Technology , Productivity, the sum of the output of these grids is your comprehensive national strength, so it is very important to build the city near special resources or wonders with happiness rewards. With the development of the city, you can build new districts and counties (select a grid to expand three new grids) to increase your national strength on the premise of reducing people's happiness. Different races have different terrain bonuses and perk. For example, wild walkers will increase productivity in forest terrain. Templar races don’t need food at all, and cities need to be built on terrain with a lot of money. Similar to civilization, EL can also carry out detailed management of internal affairs. It can be set to automatically focus on food and a certain aspect of productivity, or it can manually manage every citizen. This is very important in the game. Every round, every season, and different era detailed management can play a key role in the overall strategy. 3. Development (eXploit): The beta version temporarily provides six eras of technology discs for each race. Although there are slight differences in technology between races, they are divided into four categories, internal affairs, military, technology and expansion. At least 10, you can unlock the technology of the next era. At the same time, EL also sets the important attribute of influence. After a certain round, players can use influence to set the overall development direction for the entire race (an empire strategic disc with many concentric circles), which is also the above four The direction, each layer of the ring needs to be unlocked in a different era, and the consumption of influence and the rewards obtained are also different. The strategy cannot be adjusted at any time, once it is decided that it takes a certain round to set it again. The attribute of influence can also be used for the fusion of the heroes conquered by the wilds. After the fusion, not only can you obtain special units, but you can also get bonuses to the characteristics of different tribes. Even diplomacy requires a lot of influence points, and the declaration of war and peace negotiations require public support. 4. Elimination (eXterminate): In EL, not only heroes can be upgraded, but various types of arms can also be upgraded. The battle is directly deployed on the big map after the two sides contact each other. Unlike Heroes, it does not need to switch screens. It has a strong sense of modernity and fluency. The battle tempo is very fast, and each round will automatically launch an attack after selecting the attack target and formation for each unit. In the absence of favorable terrain, fast melee units are the nemesis of long-range soldiers. Similarly, long-range units are also a nightmare for slow melee. With the unlocking of technology, new units will appear. It is reasonable to choose heroes with different units The key to victory in battle. Of course, players who focus on strategy can also choose to fight fast in three ways (attack type, defensive type, in-place type). The game's shortcomings: lack of shortcut key settings, racial characteristics are relatively small, and others are acceptable. The beta version is so fun, I look forward to the release of the official version! ",True,True

And we have to do something there .. Unfortunately, the game is not Russian, although the text is simple, but nevertheless. The game itself resembles 3D shooters from the early 90s. And it weighs accordingly - as much as 30 megabytes. You cannot jump, the camera cannot be raised up or down, it is fixed rigidly in one projection. Many objects in the game are not volumetric, but just a flat sprite / texture. I just remembered my childhood. Opponents are always turned towards you, stationary objects can be bypassed and seen from the side that this is a plane. Textures like 30x30 or so. Music sounds like midi. But pleasant by the way. True, the main menu has a completely modern looking picture and music, which is a little out of the ordinary picture. In similar games, I have PUBG and Assassin's Creed Origins hanging.

"Halcyon 6 is a 4X/Turnbased Strategy/Tactical RPG game with great elements but not delivering a longterm gameplay value. + Graphic design: Pixel art is good but not outstanding. Some parts even uninspiring. + UI: Well set, easy to understand. + Sound design: Even its repetitive, soundtrack is perfect. Goes amazingly well with the gameplay. Sound effects are below par. + Game mechanics: There's a lot going on there and they all connect with each other superbly. + Gameplay: For the first run, everything is new, suprising and addicting. (Second run... Forget about it, you have seen it all.) - Variety on game mechanics. Even it seems like the game deals and offers amount of mechanics to the player, when you inspect the parts on their own, they all crumble. For example; there are ships but variety and customization is very low, there's a tech tree but it is very limited, there are ground battles but every battle feels the same, there are factions but they have little to none impact on the run, there is a map but its the same thing sprinkled over everywhere. - Gets old fast. After the first run, i had no intention or desire to go back for a second. Actually, i did start a second run to see if theres a new element or a rogue-like mechanic is preset... and there is not.

"This is truly a fun game to play I also enjoy a game that offers collectibles, which you get plenty to find here. There were ""Morphing"" items to collect which weren't always very easy to find as some of them blended into the background very well! You also had ""Memory"" items to collect, which again weren't always easy to spot. Fortunately, the jump map has icons for each of them so you know if there are any in the area you are at, and the strategy guide itself also had a section that showed the location of each collectible in each scene. The music in the games was so peaceful...it truly was beautiful to listen to. There is also a journal that has a section for the current objective and also gives you more of the back story. I honestly don't usually pay too much attention to the stories in the games, but that wasn't the case with this game. I honestly was interested in the story and did read the journal pages. The graphics in the game were amazing! They were very well done and then when I started to play the bonus game, they were absolutely stunning! ",True,False

"The game so far 5 hours in has been a delight. my only complaint thus far was the weird setup at the beginning of the game were it was identifying the settings? That took awhile, but its been great since. The story is awesome, the audio and game play is great. it's running on ultra at or around 100 fps average and the animations are stunning. I really don't see what everyone is complaining about. It might be possible some people don't take good care of their machines? Idk, can't say. but I am having a blast.

"Yes, the Far Cry franchise is notorious for rehashing the same ideas and gameplay over and over again but... This *is* the best Far Cry game, hands down.   Short & sweet, about 10 hours of playtime. It's full of 80s / 90s references Campy, cookie-cutter dialogue and characters that ooze 80s action movie nonsense Unlike the later games, there aren't too many collectibles. Gathering them all won't feel like a chore An amaaaaaazing synthwave OST (and I usually don't notice music in video games), so good I bought it NEON COLORS EVERYWHERE *___* I got it on sale for about $5 during summer 2019 and at the time of writing these lines, it's priced even cheaper.

"Counter Strike is a multiplayer shooter. In the game, you play on the side of terrorists and counter-terrorists. Terrorists must plant a bomb and defend it until it explodes or kill all opponents. Anti-terrorists must watch the so-called ""Bombistes"" where the bomb is planted (so far we have 2 bombits A and B.) or kill the remaining team. CS: GO is a game known all over the world. The best Polish team is Virtus.Pro, which took 1st place in the tournament in 2014. The game is very fun and addictive. The game was created by Valve Corporation and Hidden Path Entertainment. There are modes in the game such as: Arms Race (After killing you get better and better weapons. Only one person can win), Demolition (5 v 5 where you also get better and better weapons), Tournament (5 v 5 you play for rank, more on that later) , Simplified (10 v 10 the same as in the tournament, but not by rank). In this game, the skills alone will not help. You have to know hiding places, tactics, and grenades. In my opinion, it is best to play with your friends, because after 1. You have better communication, 2. You dominate the psyche 3. You can create more complex tactics than the so-called ""Rush b"". There are weapon skins, knives and gloves in the game. In my opinion, if it weren't for skins, the game wasn't that popular. Personally, I like them, but some of them can cost over PLN 2,000, which is a slight exaggeration. Of course, there will be those who collect them and are able to buy them. Time for maps. There are many maps in the game, but the most important and the most famous ones in the tournament field are: Dust II, Nuke, Cache, Mirage or Inferno. The maps are not extensive, but very good looking and done. This game can be played on a weak computer which attracts a lot of people. Earlier I mentioned ranks. A rank can only be earned in tournament mode. You get the first rank after 10 matches won and it is optional. There are 18 ranks in total. Silver is for beginners: Silver I, Silver II, Silver III, Silver IV, Silver Elite, Silver Elite Master. The Golden Laurel can also be said for beginners: Gold Nova I, Gold Nova II, Gold Nova III and Gold Nova Master. Master Guardian are ranks for mid-level players: Master Guardian I. Master Guardian II, Master Guardian Elite and Distinguished Master Guardian. Legendary Eagles are ranks with a higher skill level: Legendary Eagle and Legendary Eagle Master. The two highest and the last ones are for the best players: Supreme First Class and Global Elite - the highest rank that can be achieved in CS: GO. Summary: If you like 1-man shooters, well-made maps, skins and tactics then this is the game for you. The game costs 13 Euro (Polish approximately 50 PLN). Thanks a lot for reading the review. I hope you liked it. ",True,False

"The Edgar Mitchel Overview Effect VR Experience by Immersive VR Education and the Institute of Noetic Sciences is a great short film in which we fly back to earth from the dark side of the moon and at the same time this film is intended to bring the viewer closer to the so-called overview effect. This program was originally shown to around 100 test persons who either lay in a salty ""flotation bath"" in a wellness facility so that the buoyancy in the pool can convey the feeling of weightlessness, or they experienced the experience as soft as butter in a bed. Now we can approach the overview effect comfortably in the armchair or lying in bed or on the couch at home. So it's about seeing the big picture, recognizing what needs to be done and finding solutions and this experience should at least trigger an aha moment if it goes well. The Edgar Michell Overview Effect VR Experience naturally offers excellent images of space and authentic audio material from the 14th Apollo mission. Edgar Mitchell himself speaks to the passive viewer and explains his views on the overview effect and how it affected him. And why he absolutely wanted that all people - especially politicians - should experience this experience. With the Edgar Mitchell Overview Effect VR Experience this can work a little, I think and Edgar Mitchell would certainly be happy with the result. R.I.P. Edgar Mitchell. An absolutely great experience! Everyone who has a comfortable chair and wants to find out something about the big picture should travel here. more abstract reviews, 👀 my curator page and thumbs up, if you at least felt the aha moment. 🛰👨‍🚀🌍🌑☀️👍 There are also down-to-earth reviews here: 👑 Powered by HoI 4 Deu curator group in German / English 👑⠀⠀ ⠀🎉 and discover more reviews from me 🎊 ",True,False

"Well, this is a take from someone who doesn't shy away from old games, even though I was still a little brat when this game came out. After investing 100 hours into the game, I can finally say that I'm ready to highlight some pros and cons. Pros: Cons: Overall, this game is a relic of the past even in its Enhanced rendition. I've played a fair share of the late 80s and early 90s games (Wizardry, M&M, Gold Box, and SSI games) so putting up with bad UI and other problems doesn't bother me too much, I can still enjoy the old-school experience, and that's why I won't leave a negative review. Would I ever consider recommending this game to my peers or friends? Definitely not. Honestly speaking, you can skip this one and go straight to Baldur's Gate II. That one is better in pretty much every aspect, albeit is more restrictive when it comes to world exploration. But that's for the best. ",True,False

The game is worth buying for the sake of multiplayer, which is very interesting to play with friends. But here you have to buy kits with West Germans, Anglopedikami and allies. The starting sides (USSR and Germany) are very weak and can only fight calmly with each other. The most annoying thing is the need to microcontrol the units, by themselves they just stand and ... that's it.

"As of now, regarding the genre of Tower Defense, this very game may be the ultimate rendition. Thus said I haven't played the later games in the series yet, so these may be even better - apart from featuring sometimes questionable changes in graphics style in the follow ups - but that surely depends on your own individual taste of course. What we got here is BY FAR the best balanced yet challenging one of it's kind. Furthermore all that gameplay goodness is wrapped up in absolutely tastefull graphics, totally athmospheric music plus fantastically punchy and rewarding sound effects topped off by state of the art and straight to the point funny and timeless voice acting. No matter wether you're a noob to the genre or a veteran of the elite. This definitely is the game you want to play.

"So, today I will review one of the games that is part of the series of legendary racing games of the last decade, standing on the same level of popularity with the series, and being one of the founders of the A bit of history genre. , developed by a Finnish company, is an improved version of the second part, created specifically for consoles. In addition to resolution and slightly improved graphics, new challenges and new opponents have also been added to it. For me personally, it is this part, and not the others, that is truly iconic. Beloved by me since childhood and replayable to this day - in my entire life I spent a lot of time in it, and now it's time to buy it, and after going through it for the hundredth time I was sure that I would write this text. Now for the gameplay. The highlight of this series was the very authentic and fun destructibility of everything, but at the same time it did not reduce the entire gameplay to a car simulator. You don't have to be the first to win the race. It is enough to make sure that other racers do not do this, namely, to effectively destroy all 11 bodies that ride with you on this track (about all the participants a little later). The best way is not to drive carefully on the road, but to go ahead, knocking everything and everything in your path and never put on the brakes. All this fun will be accompanied by an explosive soundtrack written by the ambitious bands of Foggy Albion (this whole playlist is still in my player and has been on frequent listening for 8 years already), as well as very decent graphics and physics. All cars are divided into three classes (and one bonus - cars with rocket boosters, created for special tests): The whole career is the passage of the corresponding cups on the corresponding class of cars. You go through the race, get credits for it, and spend them on buying and improving the vehicle. It's the same song with the drivers. In total, in addition to the player himself, there are 11 characters and each of them is not a faceless rider, but a well-defined racer with his own character. For example, Frank Malkov loves big and hardy cars - jeeps and pickups. Jack Benton and Lee Bing are typical leaders. They are always somewhere in the first positions. There is no motivation and plot as such. These are just vigorous races accompanied by brutal music and bright explosions. Now, let's take a direct look at the pros and cons that will replace the overall estimates and numbers. :: ",True,False

"It's a pretty good puzzle-y rogue-like where you pick strategic bonuses to build your character defensively and offensively and need to carefully plan your next step around the placement and damage capabilities of each type of enemy on the field. I think it's fun and makes you think, and is great for shorter sittings. I would recommend it at the asking price! That said, I've played like a billion rounds of Hoplite, the Android game this is inspired by, and I do prefer that over this. Hoplite is really hard, and often frustrating, which this is not. I think that's not a bad thing, but neither do I feel like it's really an improvement over the original. This game adds some more offensive skills (more ranged options, most significantly) and you can pick from the full list of special bonuses at the successful completion of every level instead of a random, limited list of choices like in Hoplite. That's nice because your build isn't as subject to RNG, but it makes the game feel less difficult (so the ""puzzle""/""strategy"" aspect is a little less satisfying), and some of the bonuses are clearly overpowered and more useful than others. I think the graphics here don't look very polished; I greatly prefer Hoplite's pixel graphics. I would also like to be able to turn off the persistent blood spatter. It's a super tiny game (only 67 MB!), but feels ever so slightly sluggish on my 5-year-old laptop. That actually turned me off the game a bit, but I tried it on my desktop before writing this review and the movement feels acceptably crisp and smooth. There are a few things I actually don't like about this game. One is the inability to make the window a) smaller and b) portrait instead of landscape. As a game inspired by a mobile game and that uses simple graphics, it doesn't need to be such a big window. I'd love to play this while watching a movie on the other half of the screen. The second is that 23 levels is too long for one ""round"". There are too many same-y early levels with the first two types of monster before a third one starts appearing. You get good at killing them/avoiding damage after you survive a few levels and pick up a couple bonuses.

"For quite a long time, I could not muster the strength to express my opinion about this creation from Dontnod Entertainment. But what is really there, I played the game for a year and a half, so probably everything is natural. But more to the point. After a great first part and an interesting story about a teenage girl Max, who knew how to manage time, which diluted the sticky gameplay quite well, I expected from the continuation at least repetition and development of existing ideas. Alas, the second part is not about that. The second part is a completely different game, with its main characters. There is no continuation of the question, although a couple of references can be found with a careful study of the environment during the game. In the story, we will play for two brothers, or rather for one of them - the elder Sean. The beginning is calm and measured, we are introduced to the main characters, a little show of life before the events that led to the escape of the brothers from home and their pursuit by the police. The plot is quite original, the first dull hour of the game finally gives way to decisive actions and it seems that now everything will start. The boys run headlong, hiding from the cops, cross several states, meet new friends and enemies. And again a significant ""but"" appears here. The thought of the authors is caught immediately. An attempt to show the player the relationship between the elder and the younger brother, clumsily pressing on pity. Unfortunately, everything is done rather sadly. The gameplay is corny boring. And if the first episode intrigued the plot and it was interesting to see further development, then by the middle of the third I was already yawning and thinking, well, when is the denouement. Frankly passing fourth episode drove me into melancholy and realization that I was disappointed in this project. Well, I think the final episode is a complete failure, with the exception of the last 10 minutes, which also raise a lot of questions that remain unanswered. As in the first part, they decided to please us with the special skills of the main characters. The younger brother has a unique ability of telekinesis, thanks to which he is able to move objects and around which most important events develop. But we play for the older brother and can only tell Daniel (the youngest) what to do, we are not allowed to indulge in force, as in the first part, and from this the visibility of everything that happens presses even more. Instructions to the younger brother usually do not lead to anything, he will still do as planned by the plot, and often these are just ridiculous actions that defy common sense. It is clear that Daniel is still a child, but so much selfishness, recklessness and aggression cannot be concentrated in one person. It is corny that you don’t believe in everything that happens, but you don’t get into your younger brother, on the contrary, you want to get rid of him as soon as possible. Of course, there were some interesting solutions. For example, at the beginning of each episode, we are briefly told about the events of the previous parts in the format of sketches, and the brothers act there in the form of wolf cubs. And they themselves often repeat that they are like wolves. It sounds silly, but it is written in an original way and arouses interest. During our trip, we will visit many locations that can truly amaze with their beauty and attention to detail. From a visual point of view, everything is very good here. The gameplay itself is standard for projects of this kind. We walk a lot, explore our surroundings, talk, and occasionally make ""important"" decisions. By the way, they can influence the ending, but not dramatically. Most of the characters that we meet along the way cause only rejection and negativity. Unfortunately, all worthy ideas and developments were ineptly implemented. That is why the game, closer to the middle, simply rolls into a dull thing and continues to fall down until the final scene. On the other hand, it is still an interesting road adventure with unexpected plot twists (predictable, but still) and a high-quality picture. I cannot say that the game is not worthy of your attention, very few projects of this kind have been released recently, and even less often they tell us at least some original story. The only thing I want to note once again for those who were delighted with the first part - do not expect something like this in the second, this is a completely different game and story. -High-quality visual design, beautiful landscapes, a variety of locations -The plot, despite the protractedness and illogicality of many decisions -An abundance of small details -Gorgeous musical accompaniment -The ability to feel like a hero of a real road adventure -Dull and drawn-out gameplay -Most of the characters are completely undiscovered and cause dislike -Totalness of many dialogues -Uniformity Gameplay: 5/10 Grafon: 8/10 Plot: 7/10 Music: 9/10 - - in some places an interesting story. Unfortunately, the need to stretch the game over 5 episodes did the trick. The second half of your adventure will be bored. Alas, there are few alternatives, so you can get acquainted with the project at a discount. ",True,False

"Ohh god, this is a long-standing sequel to Metro 2033. As a big fan of both parts and a lover of apocalyptic games, I really love the metro. And what was that tax? And exactly. So after the bad ending ""metro 2033"" we continue to play for our beloved Artyom after he sent the missiles to the black lair and after we found d6. We were kind of accepted in ""SPARTA""? : D The game is very atmospheric. The atmosphere of the destroyed city ""Moscow"", the crashed plane in which some, let's say, oddity lives. Pavel, Khan, Anna and other characters were just that these dialogues were very well worked out, an interesting plot. Well, this is not ""Vladimirsky Central"" from Metro 2033. Drawings, pictures, graphics - Creators of S.T.A.L.K.E.R - EVEN HAVE BEEN SERVED! On the creators of the Metro Games Series, on the other hand, the graphics were very similar to the stalker itself. They sued to steal the original engine. The game's sequel isn't much different from the original. The plot is the same, the weapons are the same, locations and everything else ... well, you get the idea. The graphics have certainly become better, but the original was released not so long ago, so the contrast is not so painful for the eyes. But my rogue friends are most indignant about the game - the game costs a whole 900 rubles for both reworked parts. And so the game is great. The plot, the atmosphere, many different opponents (both mutants and people). Quite a lot of locations, but most of all I liked it after completing the game additional tasks. In them you can find out why you were taken prisoner by ""Reich"", what happened to Pavel after your escape, Ulman, Khan, Khan's home station - it's all very interesting. Take your time for this game. It will pay off your time. And so the verdict: the game is 9.5 / 10. ",True,False

"Saints Row 3 ... Let's say that you can define yourself as a gamer only if you own or at least have played one of the 4 masterpieces of the Volition. In my opinion the game offers all those dynamics (not just fooling around) that GTA has never offered us, with a fairly varied gameplay, an engaging and overall well-structured plot. The game itself is very long-lived and has a fairly ""standalone"" storyline, ie it does not require the knowledge that would be provided by playing the other three titles. From a technical point of view it is very solid, with pretty good graphics and a well-done optimization. It runs on almost all machines, even the oldest. If I had to rate the work done by the volition I would say ... 8.5 / 10 considering the small and occasional bugs. ~ Trane_LoneWolf ~ [ITA] ",True,False

"Considering I've always been a dedicated naruto fan and considering it as a memento that's a part of my childhood. I bought the bundle pack, so as for Storm 4, in particular. I would say in terms of its grandeur of battling I'm just left for words, speechless as that being the suiting descriptor it's just on a whole different grand scale. An echelon of high tier badassery if you ask me. The action and battle scenes are the best I've seen out of this game comparing it to the previous storm titles. Now in terms of narration and storyline (adventuring), it may be formatted differently, and brief, the antithesis sort of to the previous storm titles but, I still sobbed and yet couldn't have been more attached to it. And that's not to say the inclusion being that we also have the dlcs (Boruto expansion and the Ostusuki characters, Momo and Kin) (Adult Sasuke is badass naruto too). I know I'm pretty late on this and also I've finished the series too a while ago but, this is an all-out amazing game but, of course, long it has been obsolete considering not that many players are playing it since the game is kind of old.

"The first Evil Within was, when all is said and done, a mish-mash of just about every ""survival horror"" cliche under the sun. The game had no compunctions, whatsoever, about proudly flying the influence of every major horror game released since the early Resident Evils and Silent Hills...all the way up to the latest-and-greatest released in the twenty-odd years since, such as Outlast and The Last of Us. It got away with such brazen plagiarism for one reason and one reason alone: it was good. Real good. Probably as good as the best games which helped spawn it, and better than all the rest. Anyone who enjoyed that first instalment should be pleased to hear that not that much has changed for the sophomore outing. I mean, sure, no one should be surprised to hear that everything's a wee bit ""bigger"" this time around. More action, more gore, more stealth, more weapons, more crafting, more ""open world""-ish elements, and two - count 'em, TWO - different types of safe/save rooms. We all expected this. The good news is that they haven't gone ape♥♥♥♥♥♥with any of it, and the basic charms of the original game remain intact. It's much the same thing, with just a few more mechanics and options, and an ever-so-slightly darker (and, arguably, superior) storyline.  Heck, I was happy. Extremely happy. As I'm sure most fans of the first will be. Clearly one of the best horror games of the year, in a very, VERY good year for such things. ",True,False

"I've really loved Destiny since the first game came out and I do still love the series. Since the move to Steam I've found the game to still be enjoyable but with constant crashing on the friends & chat app from steam it's exhausting to try to play with friends. Aside from this, like the original, the game still has it's problems. At the time of writing this review we are witnessing the final days of The Guardian Games. Bungie has shown with this event that they are not even really sure how to properly balance the game so everyone can have fun by nerfing Hunters way more than they should've and literally giving Titans the upper hand during the whole event. There are broken bounties in which you have to do what it says hundreds of times before it actually registers and the whole event being based around bounties is kind of dissapointing. Season 10 is the first season where I've really sat down to play this game and aside from lore and other bits it's been partially boring. I feel like the game can really only be enjoyed if you have a fireteam to run activities with and all the DLC's bought. Another problem that this game legitimately has is the ""skill based matchmaking"". Half the time I feel like my whole team is braindead while the other team is a full clan that's been playing the game since it came out and it ruins the fun aspects of PvP. Aside form all of that I'd still recommend the game. Every game has its flaws and this game sure has a lot of them but it's still playable and very fun even if you're playing alone ",True,False

Sounds here are just terrifying, It's a mix of horror and mystery but it's always a mystery pulling you through, it's hard not to sink into this game. It's a very enjoyable experience, gimmick with regenration is something I haven't seen often. And SWERY65 made sure to not use it to much unless you like screams of agony. This title is good at showing you pain. Beat me up, but most of his games are very detailed in unexpected stuff if you ever seen Deadly Premonitions or D4, you will know his ropes around characters and world creations. And he is very wild with his works and imagination. It's also visible here. His works are very distinguishing. Plenty of ideas were implemented to keep the gimmick and story interesting including phone calls and SMS, even if some sections were a bit annoying with checkpoints / riddles. Repeating some sections was not fun... but (!!!) going in deeper the ending was worth it. I really liked this interpretation and closure.

"When I played Neil’s Weekly Objectives, I didn’t watch any strategy videos. I did few missions and I hated 9S. I felt 9S nagging, especially hate. I didn’t do much of the side missions and didn’t do much. Impression (English scum), when the main line is going on, I feel that the plot is not particularly tragic, but a bit pleasant (BGM). When Adam and Eve played, the impression was very deep. I felt that the two people fit the image of Long Aotian in my heart. Handsome and cool skills! When Eve died, he said a word, the impression was very deep, death is so cold, (I am a bit depressed), at that time, I began to think, could it be that Eve himself came to die, and didn’t want to kill 9S at all, just using 9S continuously stimulates 2B, making 2B's heart shake or become stronger. Pascal, Emiru, and Devola/Popola were very impressed, and I discussed them in detail for three weeks. Finally, when BOOS Adam played, he kept repeating, Nissan, why did you leave me (gay guy), maybe this is my brother control! At the second week of the week, because I took into account the side missions, I applied a Chinese patch. At the beginning of the second week, I made a plan, props and tasks for myself. If I can do it, do it quickly, and drag the main line first. , Prioritize the branch line,, When playing 9S, I was tortured to death (invasion to hide the barrage), I was a handicapped party, I once considered not to invade, just rely on basic attacks to kill monsters (unrealistic), when playing 9S , I’m more tired than when I played 2B. I kept reading files. When observing the plot from the perspective of 9S, you found that 9S and 2B’s inner thoughts are quite different. 9S’s inner hope is that I have been completing tasks with 2B, even if Reincarnation doesn’t matter. He hopes for the company of others. He has always been lonely. No one has ever walked into his inner world. When Eve took 9S, and when 9S repaired his body, Eve said a classic thing. , To describe 9S: Don’t you want ♥♥♥♥2B! 9S was silent, and kept crying in his heart, who would help me. When he invaded Adam, Adam said, in fact, I just want to stay with my brother. A young lady who came from the beginning just to take care of 9S was afraid of hurting 9S, and hoped that 9S would not know the truth of the whole world, let 9S always complete its own tasks, repeat the cycle slowly, and tell 2A when she is about to lose control, 9S is left to you. The truth has been concealed from 9S (I am actually a 2E model). From dislike to obsessive character, at the end of the 3 weeks, the favorite character changes from 2B to 2A, to 9S, 9S can be regarded as the protagonist, 9S is the real flesh and blood character, because when you start from one week When you observe the 3-week objective, you find that 9S has undergone a huge change in personality. At first he was lively, innocent, and had good ideas for the future (when the war is over, go shopping with 2B), and then change He has to be calm and sensible, and at the same time from the initial incomprehension to the hatred of the mechanical lifeforms (in fact, he knows best that there is nothing wrong with the mechanical lifeforms. At that time, 2B died and he could not accept it. He had to transform his goal of living into Revenge for mechanical life forms, a kind of blackening), the most 9S description has ended in one sentence, 2B, it turns out that you have been there all the time. A character that is close to invincibility, the front is tough. When you run away with blood sucking chips and iron rods and wooden sticks at full level, there are no monsters, even BOOS, and you can’t hold on to 3S in 3S. ,just. 2A just wants to end all reincarnation, and has no interest in this world anymore. When all reincarnation is completed, he will return to his original partner. The character with a miserable ending in this game feels that everything is going in a direction that he does not want. All the villagers in the village have been killed. Even the children that I have always wanted to protect have ended up killing each other. I really regret it. They were afraid. I originally wanted them to know the fear and stay away from the village to reduce their harm.

"Wow, this game, how to start. Well, just I have to say it was an extraordinary experience to play. It's a very emotional game with a fantastic narrative, exceptional music and a very touching and sentimental at the same time history. Regarding the gameplay is quite simple. It reminds me of the games of the year’s 90. Establishes such a deep connection between the game and the player who will make you feel many sensations and emotions, and perhaps even eyes moisten. At the same time it has some touches of humor. Well, I will not give more details, simply if you want to experience a different feeling and above all very human need to play. Pure love story.

You can try solo if you really love the game(cause it will be hard, you will eventually learn to play better in solo) I have lost hours of work to someone cause of my poor aim or I got greedy to loot.

The graphics are more detailed, the location much more interesting and in the story I was fascinated by the sexy Succuba, a demon of passion from hot hells. Unlike number one, I was not bored. However, it is necessary to point out one problem when searching for hidden objects - some objects need to be clicked multiple times. It's such a small glitch, but I'm used to it. Another inconvenience is the infernally difficult rotating puzzle in the bonus chapter, with which you will have to worry for maybe a few hours and then give it up. :-D I have marked the solution, so you can contact me.

"(Full review follows below) 	  is a very soulful game. That’s probably its most defining feature.  It's in the style of an isometric hack-and-slash, drawing from arcade roots and presented with a poignant atmosphere.  It is definitely a very easy game to enjoy; and it should appeal to wide variety of gamers.  And since it is medium length and has a wide range of difficulty options, it is a good game for anyone who may want to take a step out of their comfort zone and try something different. Probably the first thing that jumps out about   is the gorgeous, hand-painted artwork. But that only scratches the surface.  The whole atmosphere of this game is incredible.  The world literally unfolds around you as you make your way through the environments. The soundscape is spot on and the music is great. It is a very aesthetic experience. The gameplay is strongly narrative-based.  In fact, there is an actual narrator that guides you through the game.  This nature of the game does lead it to be semi-linear, although you do have a fair amount of branching options to work with in some aspects of the game. The gameplay is pretty simple and intuitive, but also offers a surprising amount of depth.  There is a decent variety to your arsenal and to the enemies you face.  And the baseline difficulty is very easy, which is the proper way to design games so that everyone can enjoy them.  Nevertheless, the innovative difficulty system in the game allows you to tweak various specific options (enemy health, enemy damage, player movement, etc.) to meet your preference and tackle the most extreme challenges/achievements. Now the game isn’t really that long if you were to only do a single playthrough of the campaign. However, there are the aforementioned challenges and achievements to tackle, a  , and also an   where you get a running score throughout your playthrough and can compete on leaderboards, if that is your thing.  So you should be able to get a good amount of playtime. So, in summary, I would say that the synergy of the soulful presentation, the intuitive gameplay, and the unique narration makes this game more charming than a Disney prince.    is a great gaming experience, and a modern classic.  Unless you are adamantly not interested in this genre, I recommend you at least consider giving it a shot. ",True,False

It is both accessible to everyone and finishable in a few tens of hours, and terribly difficult (the base game is not so hard, but mods make it possible to make the game more complex and extend the life of the game).

"But my biggest question now is, is this game really a global battle? When the game just came out, people can be matched in an average of 1 minute. (All national TC) Don't guess here that I haven't changed any regional languages, I have tried them all. When there are a lot of people, more than 18,000 people are playing games. Searching for self-built houses can only find a few, and they are all Chinese. It stands to reason not to mention the United States, Japan and South Korea play a lot, right? But none of them can be searched, and none of them can be matched. If the search results of the country matching are all the same country, the matches in the E area are all Chinese players in the E area. I bought the global Why is the version still unable to find people, or all of them are TC (City Dynasty). When I really searched for a self-built house, there were only a few rooms, leaving a large blank space too shivering. In my imagination, the match should not be fast. There are dozens of self-built houses, and it is also global. I don't know if I am the only person with this problem, or if many people have the same problem with me. It's like I bought a stand-alone version of Tekken, which feels weird. ================================================= =============== ================================== =============================== 1. Iron Fist's series of blows feel nothing like, first class. 2. The screen, the details are really good, and when you look closely, you will sweat and stick to dust.

"The game finally came out of early access in August and the first 2 episodes of the story mode, which will total 5 episodes, have been released. The story mode is satisfactory but repeats itself after a point. Now you keep repeating the same things to gain the trust of each different character. I can count this as the negative feature of the game. The atmosphere will immerse you, whether you play the story mode or the sandbox mode. As you have just survived a snowy storm and threw yourself into a warm shelter, you will get up and put yourself tea / coffee simultaneously with the game, you will feel cold at the computer and want to light the stove. Especially at night, both the outside sky and the stars are perfect, and if you have a stove inside, the shadows reflected on the walls from the openings of the stove are perfect. It reminded me of the house with a stove in my childhood. The lights coming out of the stove cast shadows on the wall, I would watch those shadows for hours. This game gave me exactly the same feelings years later. Absolutely play. Positive sides - Especially the soundtrack in the sandbox mode is great - The atmosphere is amazing - The map designs are very nice - It receives constant updates. New items, creatures, mechanics are added. Negative Sides - Repetition after a point. (Actually it doesn't pose a huge problem) - Some items to add are missing.

However, even tutorial left me with much to look for from the game. First of all let me start with atmosphere of game. It's almost like Far Cry Blood Dragon(cyberpunk 80's or smth). The soundtrack with drum makes battles even with A.I. pretty epic. The gameplay is based on handball kind of game, with deathmatch build in. U catch the ball, u throw the ball, while trying to survive or eliminate all who will try to destroy you. I tried only 1 vs 1, so can't say for other modes. What I did like is the various abilities, for example u can use shields, shoot or supercharge ur laser cannon and perform a 1 hit k.o. to ur enemy. Video, sound is superb for this kind of 2d game and sport theme with destroy or be destroyed kind of gameplay is a good approach to 2d world. Wish to see more active player base to test other modes in future. ",True,False

"The game is simple and quick to play - ideal to while away the evening :) Parthentius comes from town to village and raises authority in front of local cats, carrying out their orders. Expect him: fish trade, races, clashes with dogs and boars Although the game is colorful, but not very convenient control: sometimes it is very difficult to jump somewhere and not fall, you have to tinker; you can also get stuck between objects of 10 village cats out of 10!

"Where do I start. At a young age I was addicted to the first game. I would play it for hours on end finishing the game with each unique character and mastering their specific play style. This game to me was ""Icing on cake"".  When it comes to harsh survival situations, resource management and fast paced hand-to-hand combat, this game ticks all boxes.  This game also involves personal strategies when it comes to kill Zombies/mutations: Do I attack the group of mobs head on? Or attack them from a distant with explosives and firearms. The storyline is interesting to say the least, when it comes to crazed tribe men to rich military bastards, you can't help but have an envy to kill them and get off the god forsaken island.  I would highly recommend this game to anyone that can swallow high levels of gore and get entertained as much as I do from heads and body parts flying and staining a beautiful but deadly beach.  SCREAMER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ",True,False
"Thank you again for the royal fit. Without you, these reviews would not exist. In I talked about big ambition, a new format, a scenario that forces the player into the position of a character in order to combine suffering and overcoming. How could a sequel to this experiment come out? Quite entertaining, I ask you to say ... from a general point of view, it is an excellent sequel and a real gift for people like me. ROTTR fixes all the flaws of the original (whenever possible) and is a larger game. To summarize ... I really liked the game. Of course, I did not stay in it long enough, but it is still worthy of your attention. It requires concentration, patience, a desire to explore and poke around in every corner, and in return gives you a good plot with twists, good characters with character development, an epic conflict in a new setting, and new mechanics for interacting with the world and the main character. How can you do it? ... 8.5 Sick immortal warriors / 10 ",True,False

"Note: The review is spoiler-free, written based on keyboard and singleplayer gameplay. Table below for quick check, scroll down further for detailed pros and cons. :) Whoa ho ho! Cuphead.. I picked up this game the moment when I heard that it feels just like the classic Contra run-n-gun shooting. But in perfect 1930's Disney cartoon style!! Where else can you ever find another like this?!  So here I go, became cuphead boy dressed in red (or mugman in blue if you play local co-op with your partner), shooting magical droplets out of my bare fingertip, bashing in an ""Alice in Wonderland"" style cruel little damned island. I used to stay up all night beating Contra with my dad when I just started primary school, this game for what it is, went immediately into my collection.  Where should I even start?! For a game developing team that's made of 3 people, after 3 years of development, they've really made sure that almost every aspect of the game, for its own genre, is done  .  Here's something I almost forgot to mention: For every game section in Cuphead, there are   difficulty settings for you to choose from:   and  . By default, the game will always run on the Regular difficulty unless you select Simple otherwise. Simple mode excludes your ability to fight certain bosses whom you can access in Regular mode. So it's completely up to the player which difficulty they want to beat the game on..  For such quality of art design, character design and battle design, if you enjoy dying your way to perfection, this game is for you. You're prolly gonna die a lot, but if you don't mind such means to achieve faster reflex and having sense of great achievement in having perfect runs (even with your partner!), then go grab this game NOW.

"Finally overed almost all game of 2012.. but this one was due. couldnt play this at that time. Swear,this game really another amazing game from UBIsofT just before it becomes trash. Very nice post apocalipse game. U have to decide , find shortcut routes, same time find ur family. The game is nearly 6hours played and overd.Really loved it.Loved the character quickly.Realisticity well maintained. Found no glitches or bugs. but two times game crashed.Still this game is well playbale . not like stupid Ghost recon future Soldire which is cant be played cos of continuos Crashes. Graphics is Fine.Gameplay is Fine too .Overally really a great expereince. its like almost sad at the end. The name really goes with the game. Ubisoft should really make a next one.

"I've tried all of the pubg and its clones so far. There is only one thing I can say, this was the most refined gameplay among them. Even the broken vault mechanics in pubg can't work smart, this game is officially running like oil. weapon parts are automatically installed. This saved him from labor. If we want to replace it with another part, we only install it manually. Choosing where to start on the map directly saves 10 minutes. Like Pubg for 10 minutes, let the folks connect, fall with a parachute, die after 2 minutes. Starting a new game does not tire you. After a house or two, you collect enough loot to compete with the worst others. The wing suit, skateboard and zipline mechanics work great and seriously gives you an advantage if you start the game at the right spots on the map. the feeling of hitting is not bad. If we compare it with the pubg, it is a bit more arcade. The biggest minus of the game is the helicopter issue. If you want to win the game, it seems more advantageous to go to the helicopter area and run without haze. I managed to get on once and that game didn't shoot a bullet. When I went from places that wouldn't be seen in mountains and hills and when the helicopter came, I ran and climbed whatever God gave and I won the game. The bullet tracks are very good for players like me who cannot travel a long distance. You can see the bullet drop and better predict where to shoot. Although the system requirements are not as high as Pubg, he still wants a good computer. as I understand it, a good processor makes things a lot easier. In short, although my system is quite good (gtx1060 6gb), this game has managed to fill my body, tired of fps drops and general clumsiness in pubg, with the excitement of battle royal. I hope they will work harder on it and cheer up the environment with a couple of map extensions. very successful. The game turned out much better than I expected. (syozkn) moreover it's free .... The game has a nice snow map and the playground is closed due to a blizzard. When the time given before the game area is closed, we are directly in the blizzard, but compared to other Battle Royale games, this time is quite sufficient. In order to understand that you have attached a bullet to your opponent, for example, if you have played Battlefield before, there is a ""Hit indicator"", that is, a hit indicator. Weapon attachments are automatically added to the weapons and for example, when you switch to a different weapon of the same type, all the attachments of the weapon you have are replaced with the new weapon you have bought. The loot system of the game is quite good, you can easily find your health packs, weapons and armor. You can have 3 weapons at the same time. You will see the map at the beginning of the game and you will see the place other players have chosen to land. You will choose the place you want to land on the map yourself. A helicopter will come in the last closed area of ​​the game and you will have to get on this helicopter to win. Whether you are the last person left or 10 more in the game, you will win the game the moment you manage to get on the helicopter. ",True,False

"This game is AMAZING!!!!!!! But the community is trash. If you want to play the story, you'll have a great time. Getting on online is a different story. People will go out of thier way just to mess with you, and when you call them out on it they just say your being ""salty"". Don't get me wrong though, its an awesome game.  Did I mention the modders? Oh these guys are the best. They do things like Fly, be invisible, spawn objects. But even better, they can give you in game money, that can get your account banned. Rockstar did an awesome job making an entire gaming community into huge a$$holes. No one cares about helping each other out, its just shoot and get angry that people shoot you back. All in all I would love this game if the people who played it took two seconds to think. Maybe that guy spent a lot of time getting those supplies, I should leave him to his buisness. Or better yet lend a hand, maybe make a friend. But no, this game is every man/woman to themselfs and if you can make someone else day worse than yours, you win. ",True,False

"This game is really a love letter. Many people may think of a romance reading this sentence but I don't mean to say it in that way, or maybe I do, who cares. What's this and why does it look so strange? Why would a buy a game about a sloth with Trump's hair and a guy with big tumours in his head? That's what I've come to answer! First of all I want to start talking about why I said this game is a love letter. Many of you, grew up with the point and click adventure games (most of this people can't count their age with their fingers of the hands and feet together), and well, there goes the love letter part of this game. You can find tributes to some of the most popular games of this style like Day of the Tentacle, Grim Fandango, and even the Neverhood! As those games playstyle, this point & clicker emulates them. You can Use, Talk to or Pick Up all the things you have at your disposal, or at least try to :) . You have your inventory where you can try to do your must stupid item mixes your mind asks you to do, and you can not advance until the ♥♥♥♥♥ ass puzzle is solved (except the last one, which has a #### stupid method to skip it, lol). We're running late and have to answer the last question, why is it worth it to buy a so strange looking game with this weird characters telling me I will feel awkward playing this? That's an easy question to answer! As another effect from the blast from the past you can feel, this game has awesome humour that will make your burst out laughing at how stupidly it is sometimes, all the characters have a high degree of charm that will make you miss them when you finish. Aside from that, you have a superb voice acting very well done that gives some cool aesthetic to this hilarious characters that gives them the right touch of flavour to make this an even greater game. Even if it's based on some of this oldschool adventure games, you will see that this game is not as long as those, and you can finish it in less than 10 hours, which can be different depending on you capacity to solve puzzles. If there's a part that you don't know what to do, or you have returned to play from a few weeks of hard work you can just go and that's your tumor (that's why people have one, right? Really, you can do that!) even though the game is very easy and simple in the puzzle section, Hope you enjoy the game, and as cheap as it is, I don't think it wouldn't be worth it! ",True,False

"""Death End: Trial of Reincarnation 2"" is published by Landmine Club and is the second work of ""End Death: Reincarnation Trial"". The fly in the ointment is that this time the landmine agency also raised the national price to 199 yuan against the demeanor of the most conscientious day factory in the country (but as long as the discount is as usual, it will be a problem of more than ten yuan in the end. jpg). In addition, the game also adheres to the tradition of the mine club, providing krypton gold weapons that directly break the opening game experience (I don't recommend using it for the opening experience, the game is directly without difficulty after use, and the game is automatically finished). The game is considered to be a fusion of certain AVG elements. Every day in the game is divided into day and night. During the day, players can talk to the girls to investigate or learn more about them. The fighting part and plot promotion in the game are concentrated in the dark night-to be precise, after 12 o'clock. The UI and art also reflect the dark part of the plot. The initial interface will flash with dark shadows, and the UI adopts the dark (referring to the plot or art style, non-game play), the medieval slightly metallic UI commonly used in games. And the game's cutscene directly impresses players with bloody handprints that constantly appear. The plot style of the game is somewhat different from the usual style of Landmine Club, full of black and deep elements. If you want to relax in your free time, I would recommend other games from Landmine Club. The game begins with the heroine Dongshan Dance being abused by her father, and after finding the opportunity, the game officially enters the subject with a scream from her father. Wu was sent to the orphanage because she was found not guilty of justified defense, but all this has just begun. The girl who bullied Wu was killed at night (and Wu believed that she killed the girl), but the administrator told the girls that she was adopted. (The initial plot of the game, so I don’t think it’s a spoiler) Landmine Club has always been able to explore the strange RPG gameplay. Although the battle of ""Death Endgame Trials 2"" takes place in a more conventional circular area ( Depending on the situation, there will be different sizes), but the existence of the ""knock fly bug"" makes the game change from a regular RPG to a pinball game. In the game, the player can enter up to 3 commands for one action. During the battle, the player can trigger the knock-to-fly BUG through 3 attacks or use the skill with knock-to-fly effect. After the trigger is triggered, the monster will fly out like a pinball and touch When you hit the wall, monsters and characters bounce back, and when you hit a monster, it will also drive the monsters to fly together. The game also introduces a weight system. It is not only difficult for heavy monsters to accumulate fly bars and the distance they fly is very limited. Players can increase or decrease the weight of monsters by some means. In the battle, there will be various colored circles in the center of the field. If you control the character to touch the circle, you will not only get BUFF but also accumulate ""pollution value"". Attacks will also accumulate during battle. Once the pollution value reaches 80% or more, the character will enter the plug Form, the character has new skills to use in the external form. It is also worth mentioning that hitting the circle with the knocking monster will also increase the BUFF to the character but will not increase the pollution value of the game. In terms of scene exploration, each character has different abilities. For example, Wu can control the PC to view hidden channels. Rorty can overcome obstacles. With the development of the plot, even the same scene will appear new treasure chests. Dark shadows in the plot will also appear from time to time. At this time, players need to escape as soon as possible. Once caught, they will go directly to Game Over. The normal game ending method is indeed very interesting. It is a pity that as long as it is a sound person, it is impossible to be Sombra caught. Although it is not a horror game, the game still has a certain degree of spiritual pollution, so players who cannot accept it in this part should be cautious when buying it. The unique RPG combat system of the game is also quite interesting, and the character design and art also uphold the high quality of the landmine club. Landmine club fans, RPG players, and day-stay players can buy it. ",True,False

"I am writing this comment 5 minutes after finishing the game in 15 hours, I am still in the effect of the end ... Every man wants to be fearless, warrior and strong like the character in that movie while watching a pure action movie in a period of his life. After the movie is over, the person lives with the dream of that character a little more and then returns to real life. I watched many movies with this kind of emotion and then I was impressed. Especially if it has a story and a solid narrative that deeply affects you, you cannot get rid of the influence of that movie, but when you return to real life, you realize that you are standing far away from that character. I still think that most of humanity does not do evil willingly, believes that killing a person is the worst thing that can be done in the world. Just like Jason Brody. Restarting life Jason Brody is a young man in his 20s loved by his friends. He has an older and a younger brother. I'm sure Jason never thought about the issues I mentioned above when he and his two siblings and four friends went to an island in the South Pacific for vacation and fun. However, life can sometimes be seriously dirty and turn even the best man in the world into a psychopathic killer, so just imagine what he can do to a man who is already crazy. After a holiday with sky diving, waterfall jumps, parties, crazy fun, Jason and his friends did not have to meet the psychopath Vaas and other crazy pirates, of course, but after the funny images we recorded on our phone, we recorded ourselves in a bamboo cage with our older brother Grant and our hands tied Vaas' When we find him listening to, we feel that this job will not end well. Ubisoft is preparing to appear with the third game of the Far Cry series and has been preparing us for this for quite some time. When we say videos, visuals, interviews, we all know a lot of information about the game now. Therefore, there is nothing I can do more than convey my experiences to you. On the other hand, considering that there will be a separate review of the game for the PC version shortly after the PS3 review here, it is possible to say that there are many things to experience, not to be told in Far Cry 3. I would like to say. Just beware! It's not a story, it's a storytelling. As a matter of fact, our story actually comes from a cliché subject, but the narration of the events, how the characters reflect their personalities, intense emotional confusion is the biggest element that makes the game immersive. Jason is naturally shocked when his older brother Grant, a soldier, kills a person for the first time in front of his eyes, but when Jason kills someone for the first time he hardly learns how quickly and emotionally things are developing. However, Jason didn't show the acting that really impressed me. Indeed, since Jason's face is ""absent"" for us, we cannot bond with him very tightly, on the other hand, as you watch side characters such as the strange character Denis, the tribal leader Citra or Vaas, a serious psychopath, you seriously experience the intensity of emotion the game offers you.

You don't have direct control over what skills to upgrade. Action portion is a pretty standard affair. Zombie smashing feels satisfying. NPC behave in a way that you would expect. They are actually very helpful. Base management system is robust with plenty options; yet, it's not overly complicated. Survivors interact in very basic ways. Supply runs take a lot of time and effort. Completing missions becomes secondary to building up your base. Missions are varied and interesting. The story is decent. It doesn't feel too restricting.

"What an excellent time spent discovering and playing at Lancelot's Hangover! Yes the game was made by a single amateur developer, and it's the first time, but years of work and polish give it a look worthy of the best independent works. Be careful if you like P&C with hairy, cerebral and seriously long puzzles, go your way! Lancelot's is very quirky humor, sometimes very trashy (but within the limits of good taste), a concept more than a story and puzzles that will not give you too much trouble but will allow you to enjoy full storytelling for one or two evenings. You could have problems with the house cursor which is not very intuitive, so do not hesitate to use the space bar to display the hot-spots, the interest of the software not residing in the hunt for objects. Indeed Lancelot's is an ode to the P&C of the 90's (many easter eggs are present without overweight) but we old men of the adventure unfortunately no longer have the time to embark on such a Long Voyage, so that the short time spent searching for the Grail is still a good thing. However, you will find the principle of the three quests à la LucasArt, an inventory filled with objects more eccentric than each other including various more or less lawful products (admit I have just drawn your attention), a grimoire to ""decode"" and full of guaranteed GMO-free, gluten-free, inclusive trials promoting small businesses with a low carbon impact and just for that, it's worth playing;) Looking forward to rediscovering the game with a very possible French translation ( a future Christmas present from baby Jesus?) and who knows may one day be another part of the peregrinations of the sexiest knight in the Kingdom of England although The Quest for the hooly booze has a more than satisfactory conclusion .

"Dadcal's 4 is the solution to all of life's problems. All jokes aside, I think the game has one of the most welcoming community. Granted, players doing raids aren't always very nice (as well as people on region chat), but other than that--in my experience--the community is overall very giving and helping (especially the veteran players). I've been given numerous items from MR 20-26 players--weapons, rare mods, a complete set of a Nova Prime--for free). Most of them also wouldn't mind helping you on missions you find difficult, if you'd just ask. Almost to the point where they're eager, really. There was a time where I kept failing this one assassination mission, then a vet joined in, stomped the boss and asked how long I have been playing. Told him I was new, guy then played with me for a while, told me what things I should look for first and where to farm them, etc. I asked very basic questions, but he answered all of them. If I'm being honest, nothing like these ever happened with me in any game in my life. Whatever these developers did was magic. ",True,False

This is also one of the few games where the developer himself has commented on my screenshots to offer advice on how to fix certain problems.  The only kinda like bad thing would be that the game is rather short in general but there will be a Episode 2 in the future.

"The story is marvelous the fact that you can choose the ending of the playthrough is another bonus. Graphics are definitely a work of art, it's incredible. Just like in The Witcher 2, at that time no game could get near the level of detail like it had. I still haven't finished the DLCs because I don't want to end this beautiful franchise.  Game has decent RPG elements not too complicated. You can easily get connected in this universe because every character in it feels alive. Which that leads to immersion, if you're into roleplaying and some realistic stuff this game is great at it. Also side quests are not some repetitive boring fetch quests that makes you feel like you're grinding, they have pretty good storylines just like the main story.  The world is huge so there's lots of things to discover to make you feel immersed in the world. With the ultra graphics your mind will be blown away, it's a work of art. Witcher Contracts are pretty good it has the feeling of that you're really like an hunter that does research and gets prepared for the hunt but some do get repetitive. This game has background music like nothing else it gives me the chills every time. So the conclusion is pretty much this game is a must have game in your library there's always something to spend your time in. And I think it's the game of the decade, CD Projekt Red really does know what they're doing. ",True,False

"Planet Coaster is a truly outstanding game that provides both a visually impressive and rewarding experience for the player. Although, there are few issues that I have with the game, as a creative type this game is exactly what I had been looking for within the tycoon genre.  - 100% modular building system.  - Hundreds of building pieces and scenery items. - Blueprints and Steam Workshop support.  - Advanced movement tools; very handy for design.  - Basic micromanagement for staff and shops.  - Ability to choose where entertainers or staff members patrol e.g. janitors looking for rubbish.  - Intuitive coaster construction and ride customisation.  - Challenge, Career, and Sandbox modes.  - Stunning graphics and artstyle.  - Calming and unique musical score.  - Amazing sound design.  - Framerate gradually starts to fall over time due to prop detail.  - Management aspects of the game is considered quite basic by some players, however this can be looked past if you are not looking for an in-depth management experience.  - A lot of the management parts of the game are hidden away in menus that can be confusing for first time players.  Planet Coaster is a game that you can spend hours with without even unpausing the game, just to get all those tiny details ready before the guests experience your wonderland (or hell!).

I also doubted whether the game can be played comfortably without a gamepad, but I play it very comfortably. Most of the game's record holders were already playing with the keyboard. It is worth every penny, although the discount amount is generally small, I think it can be bought even without discount. ",True,False

"Highly recommended, one of the best-executed remakes there's ever been. I didn't play the originals, but it's clear there was an incredible amount of work put into modernizing the games and even improving them. I'm definitely a Spyro fan after playing this and I hope they port more games over to Steam. I'd only played one Spyro game before, Enter the Dragonfly on PS2. That was long ago, so I don't remember much of it. It was very interesting to see how the games evolved through the trilogy. He REMEMBERS all his abilities from the second game to the third game. Spyro has a lot of lines in the first game, usually some (not so) witty retort to everything; that was majorly tuned down for the next two games, which could be good or bad. The flying courses are a lot less troublesome in the third game, which also greatly reduced the amount of time to get through the story of each world. The second game is unique with pre-rendered scenes before and after each world, but it gets annoying that you have to go through everything again each time you revisit each world. Thankfully, all scenes are skippable. Also, the second game improved almost everything I didn't like about the first, especially the ability to ""hover"" at the end of a glide. Graphics are fantastic. Gameplay, well, I love collecting things and getting all those 100%s. The platforming and everything is very smooth for the most part. The games do start out very easy, but the difficulty increases nicely as they progress. There are also plenty of extra challenges to take on. It's also cool that they mix in different genres, especially with the sub-worlds in the third game, so the gameplay is more varied. I'm not sure if the Sparx challenges in the third game unlock as soon as you leave the world; I didn't do them until the end, so the upgrades they gave didn't get a chance to be very useful. Would recommend doing those as they become available. Also, make use of the nifty ""point to treasure"" feature that was added. Very helpful for cleaning up the last few gems, which can be hard to find. There's a lot more to say, I really skimmed over reviewing the gameplay. But I would recommend experiencing it for yourself if you have even a mild interest. Having a whole trilogy of games is a great value. ",True,False

"This is arguably the same as the masterpiece Quantic Dream released in 2013. This game is close to my heart as a good example of what movie storytelling should be. There is a well-made story, the elements of the story are wonderful, providing thought-provoking details, and the characters really make the story impactful. The performance of this PC release is really solid. I didn't play the Epic Games Store release and waited for this Steam version to be released. I can be proud that this is not my problem. The game can run 4K 60FPS without stutter and less than 30FPS in pre-rendered cutscenes that don't run in the actual game engine. This release was definitely worth the wait. If not everyone else, try this game. The release price of this game is solid and very good at 1800 yen. When I first defeated this game on the PS3, I thought a lot about the concept of life and the relationship with loved ones and caretakers. And how should life itself be cherished? I like this game.

"Yu-Gi-Oh Legacy of the Duelist is a duel simulator very faithful to the anime, produced by Other Ocean Interactive and Konami Digital, delivering to players one of the best singleplayer card games which makes it mandatory for all fans of the franchise . The first positive point of the game is the number of cards and the way they are acquired, here we have more than 7 thousand cards available and there is no need for you to put money in order to obtain them, all the actions you perform in the game, winning or losing will guarantee you some DP (Duelist Points) that you exchange for boosters of 8 cards each and thus increasing your options. The deck manager is also formidable, you are free to build the deck you want or play with a pre-defined deck, just purchase the cards from that deck, I spent hours building an infinite variety of decks and it is a very fun process. The game modes are very rich, you have the campaign where you follow the anime line and you can choose to use the original anime deck or a personalized deck, in all there are 5 campaigns, however the last one is only unlocked by DLC, in addition of that we have the challenges that are challenges, where the player chooses a duelist and plays against him. Also as a singleplayer mode it is possible to play sealed mode and draft mode, both very fun, but it is necessary to pay a Duelist Points fee to play it. In multiplayer mode, we have both single and ranked matches, but while I played I found very few players. In general the game is very faithful, but they have some mistakes, first a bug that bothered me well, sometimes the game just closed itself, another very weak point is the animations of the cards, it is fun to see the monster attacking in 3D, but in every duel it ends up being boring and you don't have an option to disable it, another point is the excessive number of DLCs and unfortunately the experience is only complete if you have all of them. The game is also not updated constantly, as we do not have the new types of summons and the banlist is still delayed. On the other hand, I take my hat off for the game's performance, 60 spiked spikes, without crashes or problems, the game loads very fast and the performance on the SSD is fantastic. Unfortunately the game is not in Portuguese, so anyone who doesn’t know English very well will lose interest, but the game is a full plate for those who played Yu-Gi-Oh in every corner of their city, the singleplayer experience is phenomenal, which I think is missing in card games today.

"I bought Europa Universalis IV because I was bored with Civilization 6. When I first launched the EUIV I started the tutorial right away and ... I was overwhelmed by a lot of information. The game has a lot of mechanics that you need to get to know. I must admit that at the beginning of my ""career"" I was used to the turn-based game, I couldn't get used to this way of passing time. Fortunately, I learned this after getting to know the game. EUIV is one of the games you have to spend a few hours before your ""longer game"". It's worth watching a few guides and having fun with the game at the beginning, testing various mechanics. Once we learn the game, we can start trying games seriously. It is also worth getting to know various events of a given nation or the way of playing it. When we get bored with regular gameplay, I recommend that you buy different dlc. It's best to see it on YouTube so as not to buy one that will not suit our taste.

"Depending on the path chosen, this game can be incredibly lighthearted, or incredibly...bleak. In the pacifist route the game is fairly cheerful, and the player earns the trust and respect of everyone they meet, and relying on these friendships is shown as a strength. The game praises players for pursuing a peaceful path. The genocide route is not something that can be done by ""accident"" much like it is hardly an ""accident"" to be a pacifist. You must hunt down and kill off each and every single monster in the underground. The background music changes, and the characters react with fear to you, and warn you to stop your actions many times. It quickly turns pretty creepy, but there's nothing inappropriate about it. The only ""accidental"" path is the Neutral path which happens by not meeting requirements for Pacifist or Genocide. Something else to notice while playing this game is that it leans heavily on players assuming things based on common video game tropes. For instance, if you screw up and restart quickly a character may call you out for restarting. In a second play through there are definitely characters who will say you look ""familiar"" at times, as if this has all happened before. All in all this is a wonderful game, and my only real complaint is that I wish there was more to love! It may still be a bit early to declare this an ""instant classic"" but I hope it sticks around for gamers to cherish and remember for years to come. For kids and adults, I think there's something we can all learn about ourselves from this simple indie title that the internet won't shut up about lately.. ",True,False

"How should I start to praise and explain this beautiful game? I've played many open world games before, open world and story games were my favorites, but I never thought of Witcher 3. One day, when I got hungry from lack of games, I was hungry and started Witcher 3 e. And at that time that day, I asked myself: WHY I HAVE NOT PLAYED THIS GAME THAT ULAN. The game and the story of the game got me so tied up that I cannot tell you. The characters, places, monsters in the game are all a masterpiece. My favorite feature of Witcher 3 is that you experience the final of the game in line with the decisions you make, or you may encounter different in-game results before the game ends. Who else offers you this opportunity? The game offers you a level suggestion before going on the main quests. You can reach these levels by doing side missions or by getting Monster contracts. Since I hadn't played Witcher before, I thought, what are the side quests? BUT it never was like that. There are some side missions that are much better than some of the missions in the game. Side missions have their own stories. And the end of the stories in these side missions again depends on your preference. So this game, apart from the main story, offers you a huge world and TONS of tasks you can do in that world. I adopted the character of Geralt as if I was doing the tasks in the game as if I was doing the tasks in the game. While searching for CIRI in our story, I was always curious that I adopted the circus so much that no matter what the results were, let's find it comfortable. I want to tell you the following: I have been playing games since 2006. I've done a lot of Open world RPGs, I've done a lot of story games. But this is really another game, give this game a chance. Also, I must say without any shame that it was the best series I finished and immersed myself in my acting history. I hope it stays that way. I can't help but finish the game by playing a total of 60 hours in 7 days. Besides, you not only feel the Witcher, but also the world, the lore, and the side missions. There are so many things that I cannot put into words here, I cannot explain. If I tried to write everything, you would only read it in 1 hour. GOOD GAMES. I WISH I WOULD START THE GAME AGAIN IF I LOSE MY MEMORY. IF I DON'T LOSE AGAIN AFTER COMPLETING THE GAME. If you are worried about whether or not to take it, take it without thinking! ",True,False

"When I saw that this game was avaible to buy again, I was over the moon. And yes, if you are a fan of the series, it's worth the money. As we know with other Telltale games, the choises doesn't really matter, for the most part. The story takes us on the same road, whatever your choises are. With minor details, of course. Hate it or love it, it's the same deal in this one. And speaking of the story, there will always be people who love it or hate it. And there will always be things that you can nitpick on or things that maybe aren't really that logical from a real point of view. So, those people who point that out in the forums are right. But, I personally wasn't really bothered by that so much. It isn't anything new. There's always been things which aren't logical or how they dealt with different characters. Some I didn't care about and there been others which made me angry for wasting a good character etc.  I personally have overlooked those things because even tho there has been some shady and hasty decisions in the story or to a character, like Kenny, for example, I always have enjoyed the ride while playing the Walking Dead and it has given us some amazing characters and stories for which I really feel strongly about. It's crazy how you can love imaginary characters/people, right? As I said, you can nitpick the story or why the devs did some things but in the end, I think they really made an amazing ending to this series which is up there with S1 and 2. S1 is still my fav, tho.  Otherwise, visually the game looks absolutley fantastic. The characters, the environment, the lightning is fantastic. Music is great too. It does a great job setting the mood. But I didn't expect anything less. The camera angle is a but weird tho. It took a little while to get used to. In conclusion, if you liked the first two seasons, then you most likely will like this one too and you will get a ending to this amazing character that we have come to love over the past couple of years. Storywise you will have to be the judge if you like it or not, the ""choises matter""- thing hasn't really changed so if that has bothered you, it still will. If not, then great!  But whatevere you think of the dev's decisions about the story I think it is worth your money because at the end of the day, it's a good conclusion to an amazing story & game!

At the same time, after buying a house and renovating it in the same way, it is a game that we list and sell according to our own creativity and taste.

"Screencheat is a crazy game about looking at the other players' screens to see where they are, and then proceeding to run them over with a toy horse, shoot them through a wall, blow them up with a teddy bear, or whack them to death with a fish. As you can tell from the name, the videos and the screenshots, the game is splitscreen, and everyone is invisible. You have to locate the other players by screencheating, and then go and kill them. Every kill is satisfying. A ragdoll flops into existence when someone dies, and the ragdoll models include fish-people and chickens. There is an announcer, whose accent can be changed in the options. My personal favourite is the Australian announcer :D There are 10 maps, which are well designed and colour-coded so that you can easily tell which area someone is in. There are 10 weapons, which are all unique. There are several different gamemodes, such as CTF (Capture the Fun), Deathmatch, KOTH, Murder Mystery (you are assigned a target that you must kill to gain points), and Juggernaut, to name a few. The gamemodes can be played FFA or in teams. There are also several server mutators which can be activated to create an even more hilarious/weird experience, like huge ragdolls, and Australian mode. The game supports up to 8 players on a server. 4 players is a nice number, but a full server of 8 is pure insanity, and it's wonderful. You can play local or online multiplayer, or both at once. You gain exp by playing, and as you level up you unlock bonus ragdolls (such as a hotdog) and weapon skins (such as the Cod of Duty skin for the melee weapon). Overall it's a really fun game, and it's even more fun if you have friends to play with. It would probably be a great party game. There are so many funny moments, but it can be quite competitive too, and it gets pretty intense sometimes. But it's always fun! The game needs more people playing it, so buy it sometime!

"Here, like most other games of this developer, which begin with ""Harem Girl"", and after the colon is the name of the new part, everything is according to the standard. The game starts, you are shown the basics of control in the dialog box, and then the first art that is assembled is automatically turned on 3-5 seconds and so on. Further, everything is according to the classics, probably, like all games of a similar genre, at the beginning dressed as a chan, then as you collect art, you get her half-naked and then already naked, that is, in total there are only 3 art of one girl, and all of them are in the game 20, in fact, it is not difficult to guess from the achievements of this game. Speaking of achievements. They are here and go to the main global statistics ""Steam"", which is very cool! I would like to note one art that took 3-5 minutes, namely the alchemist girl with a cauldron. You can see this art on the main store, where she pours some kind of liquid into the boiler. So, when I first assembled the boiler, I really looked and tried to understand what was wrong and how it was correct, because the center of the boiler looks too monotonous and there are few distinctive outlines in it to understand the correctness of the collection. The point is that the parts can not only be moved along the artwork and twisted, but also turned over (That is, mirrored), which complicates the collection of the ""Cauldron"". There are hints, but they are spent and given for collecting each art. I almost never used them, and some were of little use. Against the background, a depressing and sad ""OST"" is constantly playing, which you cut right away, because it introduces you into some kind of depression ... We could have done something positive. All artists have their own style of painting. The art here is very beautiful, with clear outlines and bright characters. There is also an interesting point here. It is worth remembering that if you have collected several arts, and then decided to exit, they are not saved, because you need to save the game yourself, as in a visual novel. ★ ☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆ 0.9 / 10 ☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆ No / 10 ★ ☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆ 1.2 / 10 ☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆ No / 10 ★★★★★★★★★★ 10/10 ★★★★★★★ ☆☆☆ 6.7 / 10 ★★ ☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆ 2.5 / 10 ☆☆☆☆☆☆☆ ☆☆☆ No / 10 ★★★★ ☆☆☆☆☆☆ 4.1 / 10 ",True,False

"""XBlaze! Activate!"" (Updated Review as of 7/6/16) If you ever thought to find your normal everyday life wasn't normal, then you've come to the right place, we start out our story of the Azure/Blue/etc. with Touya Kagari, a normal High School student with his pals Hinata and Akira, but when Touya comes to a place of remembrance, he meets a mysterious girl by the name of Es, and the two start their journeys together. As it is, XBlaze is the prequel story to the popular fighting game series ""BlazBlue"", the lore you'll seek from BlazBlue will also be mentioned here as well, including some characters within similar familiar names and other viable info. Originally available on the PS3/PSV, the Steam release is more or less the same as it is, with a few PC options to tweak to your style, along with the option to have the subtitles either in full English or Japanese. The game is pure Visual Novel, so the game relies on its own system called the ""Toi"" (which also has Character Bios), using it wisely will decide your fate, from getting the good, bad, or even the gag endings. Using ""Tips"" will let you know on info of the XBlaze world, though some of it will differ depending on which character route you're planning to clear. Either way, the port is great, and it loads scenes and such faster than the console version (also, bonus extras if you happen to clear all routes in the game), but yes, as usual with majority PC players, there will be problems with people trying to run it, it happens to some, but not all, but it happens. That's what there's the forums/discussions are they for people to check out the issues and for users that can help out on it if at all possible. As of 3/3/16, a 9.1MB Patch/Update/Etc. has fixed some of the game's issues as I've originally mentioned before, that being the A.O.S. crash, the half and half localization errors, and probably crashes when trying to continue certain chapters/routes. There still might be some bugs in there, but will be known whenever necessary. As of 7/6/16, Aksys Games announced at Anime Expo that XBlaze Lost: Memories will now get its steam port, so yeah! \^^/ ",True,False

"For me personally, everything is white, fluffy and frosty already pretty good .., ostop ... and osto ... But for those who are still ready to see snow. Welcome to the Himalayas. Following in the footsteps of an eerily secret expedition organized by Yumi in search of another unknown shit. So, Ajay Gale continues his fascinating Asian tour, combining hunting for rare species of animals and strengthening the camp with all sorts of fashionable chips. Although, judging by the loot in the boxes, the previous hunters have multiplied everything more or less valuable by zero a long time ago, and put the skins in boxes and forgot. Local natives, for some reason, do not like guests at all. Airplanes / helicopters shoot down, prisoners are fed to Himalayan Bigfoot. They live by hunting and gathering unknown henna, from which all kinds of substances are then produced. Substances devour and go to nirvana. There are plenty of weapons, but everything is old. New copies in the DLC were not delivered. What didn’t please, I categorically didn’t like the absence of helicopters. If you can still get used to resetting the skill tree, then you can't live without helicopters. Fortunately, the map is small and you can drive it from end to end very quickly. I liked the process of equipping the station. And immediately there was a lack of all sorts of cunning traps in the style of John Rambo, both in the main game and here in the valley. I liked the process of searching for additional stationary weapons. Grab the truck at point A, take it to the base. And in the part where you need to think and climb the rocks. It's a pity these tasks are few. From nit-picking transport, in addition, rushing through the snow like a dry highway. It was probably worth tightening up the mechanics of the moving process.

"The new DLC is too expensive, please beg for a discount~ I strongly recommend this game, it is best to find a small partner online, you can trade to each other if you don’t need equipment (but why don’t my friends like this type of game and don’t eat me Amway) The connection is not bad. Basically, you and your partner are the same network operator, and you can connect or not card an excellent ARPG game. The key point is to swipe, swipe until the sky is dark. (Although I have only cleared a character, the equipment is not good, and I have not graduated yet) If you like this type of game, but still hesitate between entering the game and piracy, I hope you can give developers and small workshops some support. (Personally looking forward to the next game) 1. The diversity of occupations + skills + constellations gives this game unlimited possibilities and freedom, which is also the biggest feature of dark games. 2. The game screen is slightly dark, but it fits the background and theme. 3. The percussion feels the hammer to the flesh, and the music can also be considered in place. 4. In the game, we will encounter a lot of choices, some choices will lead to the death of NPC and influence of influence, but we do not need to be intimidated in the novice period, after all, there are 3 weeks, the last week Just choose it carefully. 5. Don't look down on the green outfit. A green outfit with a good prefix is ​​better than a blue outfit or even a purple outfit. 6. This game can also be called the Dawn of Resistance. Personally, I suggest that armor should not pursue any attack attributes. Honestly pile up all kinds of resistances, and spawning monsters can be a lot of peace of mind. 7. The character build can refer to others, but copying is not recommended. Only by researching on your own can you better understand the game. 8. Grim Dawn-Crucible Mode DLC, this DLC is almost necessary, allowing you to quickly have 10 constellation points in the early stage (although it can be more, but the first 10 are cost-effective), and it is also the most important source of purple equipment in the later stage. 9. Grim Dawn-Steam Loyalist Upgrade. This DLC is just a few skins and does not affect the game experience. 10.

"Amid sonic reverberations from a gloomy symphony orchestra, made up of steel beams and sheets that dance to the beat of the ocean current, a man in a diving suit wanders the rusty and empty corridors of a colossal corpse, buried in plain sight deep within the ocean. bluish canvas. A nineteenth-century steamship, sunk in forgotten territory where sunlight no longer penetrates, a gloomy and supernatural secret that awaits to be solved before it is too late ... It is no coincidence that the name of the vessel to be explored is SS Eurídice, because in Greek mythology, that name corresponded to a nymph who suffered a cruel fate in a tragic love story, as well as it was the name to which the HMS Eurydice responded, a vessel that suffered one of the most naval endings. tragic of England and of which it is rumored that it can be seen still sailing in the distances, in the form of ghost ship. Although the SS Eurydice from the Lazy Monday Games work is not shown as a wandering apparition, it does respond to the Greek myth, since this is the story of an explorer who, not being part of the crew, gets his place in it to be able to travel to England and thus reunite with his beloved. Unfortunately among the cargo that the ship was carrying, no one suspected the inclusion of a dangerous object that accompanied them on board. Everything would therefore remain in the hands of the explorer, since he would be the only one capable of preventing the threat from reaching port. There is no word that better defines restlessness, that uneasy expectation that takes hold as one wanders through the labyrinthine architecture of the sunken ship that does not stop screaming in twisting of metal that sounds in the distance. Without music to acclimate the progressive descent, the setting is based on the solitude of the void that is the bottom of the ocean. To do this, he uses a mixture of his pixelated art, whose surfaces create a play of light and shadows when interacting with the protagonist's flashlight, and in the background he projects a perpetual echo that helps to maintain a satisfactory mix between immersion and discomfort. Among those narrow corridors that end up leading us in circles to lead us to the loss of physical notion of the character, there is an interesting detail, because it is not a design flaw. In the letters found as you advance, the history of the crew will be unraveled, of how they began to get sick and get lost in the passages that later they said, disappeared. Said writings, wet and illegible, will be understandable when turning off the flashlight, as if time and space were twisted until they brought the protagonist to the point where they were written. What actually happens when the flashlight is turned off? That light that emanates from the diver's helmet reveals a second use when it is turned off, allowing the lamps in the corridors - still functional - to warn of a different version of the facilities, as if it were another reality. This mechanic is necessary to solve different puzzles that block the way on certain occasions, blocks whose resolution will not oppose great interactive or reflective resistance, but will allow us to realize details such as the appearance of previously non-existent surfaces, changes in the environment, supernatural events and on certain occasions, the sound of voices that are heard through the echo. These details seem to converge the past and the present in an embrace, like a memory that is brought up and remains weakly, or like a skein of hallucinations that seek to convey a message. Thanks to the insertion of this mechanism, the restlessness of the experience is increased as well as its attractiveness. It is thus, as if making use of a satisfying and enveloping setting, hand in hand with a striking mechanics, like a small title, from which little and nothing could be expected in the first instance, it ends up delivering a pleasantly gratifying game once all its ends are tied together, allowing a glimpse of the fabric of love and last will of a man in his battle against forces beyond his understanding.

"The social deduction genre is increasingly gaining space in the games market, mainly for presenting extremely fun gameplay and a high replay factor. So, with Among Us it was no different, the title that was originally released in 2018 for mobile version and later for computers, has been conquering several players for presenting a simple proposal and with a lot of strategy. The objective of the game is to participate in a lobby with 4 to 10 players, in order to find out who was chosen randomly among the crew, to be the imposter, and can be one or even three imposters depending on the settings selected by the creator of the living room. During the match, the astronauts will need to perform the puzzles on the map, in order to complete the objective bar that is completed according to the tasks done by each one. If this bar fills up completely, the crew wins and the fraudsters lose. However, this will not be so easy, because at all times the person who has been designated as a traitor will be sabotaging the locations on the map and killing the other crew members. At these times, it is worth using all strategies to unravel the liar in the middle of the team, through accusations, blackmail, espionage or even with proven facts. If all the assassins are expelled, the crew will win the match. Impostors can also win by killing 80% of the team or by sabotaging specific places, such as oxygen chambers for example. In addition, they can use the duct system of the scenarios, in order to move quickly or hide from possible accusations. Because it is a title for mobile phones, the game has extremely easy gameplay and quick puzzles. In addition, his cartoon graphics in 2D are super light and manage to be satisfactory by the proposal he addresses. Unfortunately, a chronic problem in Among Us is its bad connection, due to the fact that it does not provide servers in the South American region. This ends up causing sudden disconnections and high pings. Therefore, those who do not have a stable internet can suffer a lot when trying to play. In view of the aforementioned arguments, Among Us is a title that can be played by all audiences, even for those who are not familiar with the genre, because it is a super fun title that encourages socialization, as it contains an easy-to-learn mechanic. and the free version offered to both IOS and Android. Other than that, this game is recommended mainly for playing with friends, because it provides great moments of entertainment. • Contains 3 different maps; • There are 6 languages ​​available, including PT / BR; • Active community; • Practical gameplay; • Satisfactory sound effects; • Dynamic and strategic. • Make servers available for other regions; • Correct color bugs, it can happen that two people get the same color; • Add achievements.

"I was afraid that it would be difficult to play such an old game, but, surprisingly, the pixel graphics turned out to be quite pleasant and you quickly get used to it. And the other aspects of the game are good even by modern standards, a convenient and intuitive interface, it is even easier to understand the arrangement of the base and the equipment of ships with fighters than in the 2012 remake. On top of the Steam version, I rolled OpenXCOM (a modern open-source implementation of the game, which is actively supported by developers), so for the entire time of the game I did not encounter any problems or bugs, everything is licked to a shine. I don't see much point in talking about the gameplay, it is completely the same as in other games of the Xcom Universe that I have played at the moment (except for the disgusting craft called ""Bureau"") - there is a global view of the planet, there is the arrangement of bases, there is research / development, there are turn-based battles between a squad of soldiers and aliens.

"One of the most hardcore collectible card games in the new 2014 version. If you want to familiarize yourself with the board, then this is one of the cheapest ways. One of the friendliest trainings. Even a person who has never seen such games will be able to learn how to play without much effort. Of course, there are nuances in the rules of the game that a beginner will have to learn, but the game makes it possible to get acquainted with them. By the way, I wrote down my training -. A little about the cons: 1) bugs and lags, unfortunately, were not completely eliminated even by the 2014 version; 2) you cannot play with decks from previous versions of the game (2011-2013); 3) the game does not welcome third-party (unofficial) decks that can be downloaded and even installed, but it is problematic to play them online with others; 4) the idea of ​​sealed decks, of course, brought the game closer to customization, but there is no way to play sealed decks against, say, classic builds (only against other sealed ones), as well as there is no way to play them in two-headed mode, which almost completely kills the idea with sealed decks; 5) you cannot completely collect your decks (customization is limited by the framework of decks and various tactical decisions within them - booster packs); 6) it's a pity, they didn't even think of implementing the game in a circle in the 2014 version. On the pros: 1) the game has just a gigantic number of tactics, limited only by the imagination (this, of course, is an illusion, since the imagination here means that of the authors, but the fact is that it is simply immense for them); 2) left my favorite two-headed giant mode (2v2 game, in which 2 partners play against two others); 3) design and simply fantastic art (talking about the drawings on the cards and their correspondence to the names of the cards - again, the imagination of the authors is simply amazing); 4) the classics of the genre of card games, the basic rules of the game, the thoughtfulness of the process, Magic is just fun to play; 5) a large number of decks, 1 deck of board games will cost you much more than this game.

"- You tried to kill me! “You're alive, so don't complain. Hitman: Absolution is a stealth action game not for the faint of heart, the fifth installment in the Hitman series. You play for the well-known to everyone from the previous parts, Agent 47 - a clone ""Hitman"". In this game, you decide how the kill will be performed, either you kill stealthily and try not to be seen by the enemy, or you kill effortlessly and go straight (this is not possible on all difficulty levels.) Throughout the game you will try to get through difficult levels, where you will not be allowed to rest for a second, the slightest wrong movement and you have already been discovered. Very exciting passing in stealth, makes you think how to kill without being noticed. It is a pleasure to earn achievements. You are given a task to pick up a certain girl Victoria, who the agency needs. 47 agrees to the contract, even though deep down he does not want to kill Diana. She turned out to be a new project that really needs to be returned back and he will protect her with all his efforts. This game is designed primarily for stealth. A large selection of weapons will not let you think long about what and how to kill. The powerful game engine gives a very beautiful picture. You can create your own contracts and play already created by someone. For completing contracts, players receive money, which they can use to modify weapons or buy suits. The main game has a so-called Hitman: Sniper Challenge mini-game. To prevent players from getting bored, the developers made a special table that displays the progress of other players. Whoever thinks to take it for the first time and does not like games where you need to hide and disguise, then I do not advise you to take it. Decent fifth of the series. P.S. Thanks for attention.

"Not a bad platformer in which you need to bring the ball to the end of the level through numerous obstacles. All this is played better than it looks in the screenshots - I expected to see gloomy trash, but in the end I went through the whole game. In Spectraball, everything is tied to physics, you need to be able to accelerate and choose the right trajectory, any wrong movement is sent to the last checkpoint. The game is moderately difficult, but there are only 8 levels, not counting 3 bonus tests, so you can complete everything in a couple of hours. However, if achievements are important to you, then don't even try to play it, because because I can't imagine how you can complete all the stages in this game without a single mistake. So getting the ""perfect game"" in your profile will take a lot of work and exponentially longer time. In general, Spectraball is clearly not worth the full price, it is interesting to play, but the content is clearly not enough. The levels have a completely different appearance, but I would like the difference to be not only visual, but also gameplay. For example, I expected that there would be lower gravity at the ""cosmic"" level, but as a result, the physics of the ball did not undergo any changes. But if you take Spectraball on sale, then as entertainment for a couple of hours it will come off - fortunately, the game gets -90% discount quite often. ",True,False

"""Assassin's creed"" basically became derogatory words around the 3rd-4th installment with people saying it's another Call of Duty in terms of differences between each installment and I guess Ubisoft was afraid of changing their ways, after all why alter something that already sells well, right? But oh boy, have they outdone themselves with the latest two games (Origins, Odyssey). They finally mostly dropped the real world story parts and focused on telling the Animus - the recollections part, which makes total sense considering no one ever actually cared about the real world narrative, when people think Assassin's Creed, they think Altair's and Ezio's stories, not Desmond's. Talking about characters, I only played Cassandra thus far out of the two character choices, but I gotta say she almost instantly became one of my AC favorites. They somehow managed to comply the SJW/feminist propaganda by making her a strong, self-dependent female individual while she's also very attractive, charismatic and powerful - truly an impressive feat. They also finally realized that unless they keep revealing major story plots throughout the playtime rather than only at the beginning and the end of the game, the playthrough would become repetitive and eventually boring. In Odyssey, one of the main mechanics became available after nearly 20 hours (!) of my game time. Obviously if you rush through, you'll progress way faster, but who doesn't explore and mess around in AC games..? The story itself is pretty good, it's not revolutionary by any means - good old revenge trope, but it's interesting enough to keep you engaged and there're some twists here and there. I'm not anywhere near the end of the game, so I'll refrain from commenting on this topic any further for now. Now the game isn't perfect, some people don't like the presence of an ingame store which lets you purchase ""time savers"" (cheats), but I simply choose to ignore those features - they don't really add anything meaningful to the game and it's easily playable without its usage, even on the hardest difficulty. Talking about difficulty, some fights seem to be really unbalanced - legendary creatures (such as the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pig) force you to fight in a certain way so if you chose to be a full on assassin, you literally have to respec and even then it's tough. So far, the pig fight and the fraction battles were two situations I found really frustrating, other than that everything was doable (on nightmare difficulty). That being said, I'm quite impressed how good the game is thus far. 9.5/10 easily at the point of writing this review. ",True,False

"Warning - it will take you several hours before you can have wild fun like they've presented the game in the gameplay trailers At the start, your map has marks of several Arks, those contain new abilities and guns, but after you finish them, they don't show up anymore, you have to progress through the story, without idea when they're gonna show up again and then you have to either randomly look at every Question mark ? location, to see if it's an Ark or not , when I was one mission away from the end of the game, I had still 3 guns missing and for abilities I went through half of the game without most of them, simply because Arks are stupidly hidden in world map clustered with nonsense of ??? icons ...I literally finished the whole game, all NPCs were lvl 15,16,15 as I spent ton of time doing all side missions, I had 32 gun upgrade tokens and 20k feltrite and the nonsense upgrade system made it so that I had only lvl 2 guns, the entire game, on hard difficulty, so most of the tougher enemies felt like bullet sponges ! , this way you can actually use it, unlike the original terrible keybinding. By pressing Shift once, you'll warp into direction of the key that you hold (for example you hold A and press Shift, you warp to left), by holding Shift, you'll see enemies, your car and with later upgrades, chests, Ark chests and PDAs +plethora of weapons, shotguns, pistols, rocket launcher and more +interesting abilities like warping forward, powerful ground slam, little black hole +variety of vehicles to drive and upgrades for your main car, weapons and armor +the Overdrive mode basically allows you one shot kills, great for horde clearing +the gunplay is solid and taking down huge monsters, especially at the start, is a blast -pointless NPCs in cities, that you can talk with and they give you quests, for which they often don't give you anything -story is very straight forward Revenge type, with not many twists, often it felt like a chore -map is littered with icons for millions of things to do and it doesn't feel like you have real impact on the world -the Authority turrets are annoying bullet sponges that don't fit this game, you have to take cover and basically spam assault rifle shots at the blue part, then hide behind metal crate when it fires, do this for literally few minutes... -only your car can be upgraded, no other vehicles can get upgrades -the racing minigames on the track are quite bad, as the cars handle poorly -there's no real payoff for killing the spy drones, just another wasted chance -after you finish the game and credits roll, there's bit of cutscenes where all the major characters tell you how This isn't the end, and how you're needed very much in this world...this is sadly nonsense, there's nothing new once you finish, so no point in playing more ",True,False

"To begin with, I'll say that before us is the same Far Cry 3, which changed the map and made the game more cinematic. The gameplay is essentially the same, but not the best console port. Optimization pleased me, because on my ""bucket"" the game runs at a stable 20-40 FPS. Pleased with the study of the open world. It is really very large, but, as in Far Cry 3. the second part of Kyrat is not available immediately. It hurts. Nice graphics, but shadows sometimes spoil the whole picture. Let's walk through the characters. I remember each of them. The fate of each of them is very interesting to watch, but the fact that you are being reprimanded for wrong actions (according to the personal opinion of Amita and Sabal) is simply amazing. Feeling as if you screwed up in life. As for the main villain ... well, how to say. Although his appearance is ambiguous, he is incredibly charismatic. Music. Of course, the soundtrack is not as good as in The Witcher, but these are completely different games. about Far Cry, so here I was pleased with the sounds of the surrounding nature. The music in the car was chosen very well, the developers realized that most of the time, we would be moving around in cars. Rabbi Ray Rana. His radio appearances are not well developed. Very often he repeats the same phrases in the interval of 3-4 minutes. At first it is imperceptible, but then it starts to enrage. When you vacate the towers, it is often fashionable to hear new messages, which are quite interesting to listen to, but again, not 3 times a day. A lot of additional tasks, a huge number of weapons, a lot of outposts, etc. Actually, I haven't seen first-person shooters with an addictive plot for a long time. Let's walk through the plot. You come to Kirat to dispel your mother's ashes. At this time, a civil war is raging there between the ""Golden Way"" and the ""King's Army"". Pagan Min, the main villain, sweetly invites you to dinner, shooting the floor of the bus, where he politely sticks a fork in the back of your friend, and then leaves to apologize to him ... by torture. You ... being frightened, run away from the place where a dumb fanatic intercepts you along the way, who will later introduce you to the ""Golden Path"" and you will play a little bit there, and then you will have to save Kirat, etc. ... well, everything is in yubisoft style. This is just the beginning of the game, I will not go into details of the plot further. Pros: 1 Great plot. 2 You quickly get used to the controls. 3 Convenient system of points distribution, crafting and more. 4 Great music. 5 Well-developed characters. Cons: 1 Not the best port from the console is immediately visible. 2 The game rarely, but still sags, especially after death. 3 Artificial intelligence.

Zombidle: REMONSTERED is an indie clicker game. In this clicker game you play as the zombies/monsters burning down and pillaging the villages full of people gaining skulls along the way. You use those skulls as your currency for upgrading your amry of darkness. Every once in a while you also run across a scroll that will randomly appear on the screen. These scrolls give you extra things such as chests that have skill upgrades inside them or you can increase the value of the skulls that drop for a few minutes at a time. All in all this is a very well made clicker game and I would definitely look into it if you're interested in something new to help pass the time. ,True,False

"Actually as of today 11/20/2019 the growth that Project Zomboid has had compared to previous years is brutal. For all those who are with the prejudice of ""it is a 2D zombie game and without very crappy animations"" or ""Very realistic but few players"", people give the game a chance, since they added in the BETA phase to the animations it is a game totally different, it is a new way of playing, thinking, adapting. Features that you thought were extinct in survival games like SCUM, Rust or others, are here. It is a singleplayer and cooperative / multiplayer (I recommend singleplayer thousands of times) with many forms of gameplay, a way to customize world creation and above all, create your character (Character creation is not a great thing but it is not so prong as before). I think that all the survival of the most intelligent or fittest turns into Project Zomboid, strategies to divert hordes, create sound devices to distract zombies, that there are countless clothes with their protection against scratches, bites, protection against the wind, isolation. People are nonsense that one will say, good to fart so many items but that is what makes the game unique and so attractive, stupid things like bathing with soap since not bathing you get dirt and in case of having a scratch or laceration you have less probability to survive than having moderately clean clothes. That there is a temperature system not only environmental, with storms, inhuman heat, winter and blizzards, there is also a body temperature system, what does it mean? That your actions within the game indirectly incur consequences to the character (NOT ALWAYS HARMFUL) that would be like sweating, being overweight under physical condition, sudden thirst attacks, etc, etc. I invite you to try this wonderful game, highly recommended and for those who are hesitating to buy it, do not hesitate to add that I will be a source of doubts. PS: After finishing the animations the price increases, so take advantage. ",True,True

You can go fishing, you can also complete quests from a fisherman and get a reward for them. You can create and build anything you want, anywhere.

"One of the few games that I decided to do an analysis. EoA, from the same producer of the excellent Skyborn, for those who played, already knows what to expect in terms of quality. The plot, without giving too many spoilers, in the marriage of his brother prince to the princess of an enemy kingdom, everything goes wrong. The princess is kidnapped and it's up to you to run after her but soon you discover that the story is not that simple and it's up to you to solve everything. The plot is very well worked, with charismatic characters, now it has a menu ""LORE"", talking about each character, which is very cool, in the course of the game you discover new places and learn more about the kingdom. The big change is in relation to combat, with the grid system, it was VERY good. The list of ACTIVE / PASSIVE skills is huge for each character, giving more space to different strategies, at the level 11 I am in, I have 5 tabs for active skill and there should be about 12 skills to choose from = D. A nice thing about combat, which has no MANA bar, skills need TP, which is accumulated with the battle and needs to be recharged (I thought it was cool that the first ""healer"" on the team, for you to heal someone, you LOSE the character's HP, very nice), and at the end of each battle, your HP returns to maximum. Craft always present, but again there was a ""compare"" to compare the items equipped with the craft item. The augments are better, with the option to remove \ o /. Very cool graphics, even though it is a RPG MAKER game, the world is very alive and worked, very positive quality of the devs. Music is out of the series too, orchestrated. I just didn’t like some of the menu that are kind of boring. Overall, I score 9. I recommend it to anyone who likes an excellent RPG. ",True,False

"Ok I am biased on this review considering I am for REAL an actually Ghost sniper or so they call us that... civilians... enemy... haters... the US Government. The game is OK the state of play they use reminds me of Columbia just a different Cartel back than... we were fighting. Overall the missions are ok the timed missions suck unless I have C4 or I am blowing an entire base or compound I should not be given always 2:26 to do the stupid deed. That is funny the stupid timed missions... everything is timed down to the sec yes but I will be home eating a freaking Taco while your body bags are being loaded not waiting for my watch to hit zero trying to move a stupid truck up and down a road a mile whatever in always 2:26 drop this crap its stupid. Thats the only problem with the game I have. The AI is impressive not stupid can flank and even at times hunt you very smartly and if they dont get you especially Unidad soldiers they bring everybody and I mean EVERYBODY! twice I have actually fought Unidad soldiers over 200 in one game and playing solo just the other night easily 300 until yes they hunted and killed me and my squad by air and by ground. it appears the AI does not like the Unidad soldiers killed off it actually gets pissed off because they respawn like roaches,,,you kill 3 6 appear..you kill 6 12 appear and so on the AI gets angry. The stats kinda suck on elite soldiers, they are kinds confusing and hard as hell to understand how and when they raise...My Tactical I understand...My stealth Ok have no idea how you figure that one out because I have cleared major bases and compounds without ever being noticed and after %80 it does not move go figure and precision man ok every round has to be a confirmed kill I quess because that must be bullet to kill ratio but whatever still figuring that one out. KIA should be a stat on your player profile always good to look at a number showing enemy killed its motivating. The game is awesome graphics wise beautiful and crisp... couple hole traps where your dude falls in and you have to restart but minimal. Overall gameplay is super fluid and smooth wonderfull scenes and landscape just awesome in that department.

"The final game in the Desmond series. American Revolution, a new main character in the Animus, a change of scenery, a bunch of goodies and significant changes in the gameplay. Why not just stuffed into this part. And the arrangement (though indirect) of his estate and naval battles (looks and operates perfectly) and the change of weather, time of day and seasons. All this, however, is not perceived as a whole, but as pieces of a general structure, which often does not work quite correctly, with malfunctions. Quite a lot of bugs for a project of this level, glitches, people appearing out of thin air, hero failures under textures, invisible walls, annoying jumps past targets. Sometimes it all looks mediocre, because the management or environment banal does not allow you to fulfill your plans. But overall, the game was a success. The story of the formation of the American state, told with humor through notes in the Animus, is not embellished, as the Americans themselves would have, but more caustic, true or something. Good plot, characters and addictive gathering do their job. In the end, the truth of ""Assassin's Creed III"" falls on its side, gets bored, the ending is disappointing. You play out nervously when it's over. The extended duration did not go to the advantage. The main character, Conor, is also annoying, I want to give him a slap so that the elders are not rude and behave normally. Although the guy survived a lot, he grew up as a hypocritical nervous psycho, moreover, he was also driven and not very smart. But he handles an ax perfectly. Despite the shortcomings, it is still interesting to play, the project is made at a high level. Fans are required to pass, others, at will, may get bored with hours of running through the forest.

"The game is really fun and hilarious, all of the guns feel great and there's a bunch of different weapons/items, it includes all the standard guns you'd expect, M16, AK, AUG, Mac-10, double barrel shotgun, Winchester, MP7, and a bunch more, and all the standard attachments and grenades, but also a bunch of more wacky over the top stuff e.g. A handcannon, that is literally a cannon you hold in your hand, banana suit Armor, implosion grenades, and so on. You can hold your gun sideways and beatbox. The over the top physics are great. Guns work similar to Pubg, having single fire, full auto and occasionally burst.  Your character has some ragdoll physics so you can do things like jump through small windows, it's pretty satisfying being able to smoothly jump out of a building window into another. There are vehicles, but right now I think there's only one type of car (?), though I'm not sure I've played enough to judge. Players in this game are essentially wacky inflatable tube men, running around feels a little bouncy, but not too much.  The controls responsive and aiming/shooting feel great – and that's coming from a guy with 4k hours in CS.  I think the bounciness of the characters helps to balance gun fights, most guns I've used seem to be hit scan and very accurate, though some guns e.g. the VSS , have bullet travel time – working pretty much the same as the VSS in pubg. The gunplay in this game is actually great. You never really feel cheated and the combat is skill based.  The game uses low poly models, but are aesthetically pleasing and cartoonish. I personally like the art style. To make a more objective comment, the artists did a very good job at sticking to the same low poly cartoon style in all of the assets and it is fitting to the silliness of the game.  1. The servers are currently getting more traffic than they can handle – the game got more popularity than the devs expected. Played a few games this morning that went perfectly, instantly getting into games with no issues, but at peak hours (on the EU servers) I've been disconnected a few times. Launch issues are normal and to be expected. 2. Framerate was a bit choppy when I started playing --   this seems to be because the  default view distance is crazy high, lowing it made my game run allot smoother and I could still see players miles away anyways. Overall I'd say this game is fantastic and great fun. While the game was made as a joke, the features are actually implemented really well to the point where I could play this game unironically. Though, it may be worth waiting a few more days to play (Time of this post 8th June) , for launch issues to die down. Though they are mostly fixed at the moment aside from occasional disconnects at the start of the game. ",True,False

"The Elder Scrolls Online tells us about the events that took place 1000 years before the events of TES V: Skyrim. In terms of content, the game surpasses all previous games in the series. If you're interested in learning more about Tamriel, take the time to complete the campaigns for all 3 alliances. Believe me, the abundance of information will make your head spin. In terms of gameplay aspects, the game combines the features characteristic of the previous games in the series with the principles of the classic theme-park MMORPG. I personally cannot imagine a better implementation of this merge than the current one. Although we have irrevocably lost such opportunities of previous TES as cutting out unwanted NPCs and stealing items, we still have the opportunity to influence the world. We can exert this influence by the results of completing quests, which, it should be noted, have several ending options. For example, we can persuade the accursed population of the village to commit mass suicide or vice versa, dispel depressive moods and persuade them to continue living. As a result, we will get either an empty village, or filled with NPCs with whom you can communicate and trade. In this case, the result of your choice is visible exclusively to you. If you saved the population of the village, and your friend did not, then he will only see how you speak with emptiness. Zenimax calls this idea phasing. Although on the one hand it looks far-fetched, expanding with the perception of the game world as a whole, I do not see a better way to create the illusion of individual influence on the world. The combat system is again a hybrid of the system from the previous games in the series and the classic MMORPGs: you aim like in Skyrim, but to simplify and solve the problem of network lags, you do not need to aim accurately - an error of several centimeters is acceptable. As in other MMORPGs, you have a skill bar, but this time it is limited to only five skills / spells. So you need to choose them wisely. It should be noted the amazing voice acting of absolutely all quests. And the quests themselves quite maintain the level set by the previous games in the series - no ""kill 10 rats"". Of course, the dialogue is animated, but there are no amazing cutscenes like in Star Wars: The Old Republic. However, in single-user TES they were not there either. The game was released quite recently and has a long time to develop with increasing content and features. So, there is still no opportunity to buy your house, which you fell in love with in early games, as well as the quest lines of the Thieves Guild and the Dark Brotherhood. However, content updates are released quite often, it is clear that the developers are busy with business, which is good news. I recommend this game as a must-play for all fans of The Elder Scrolls universe and fans of high-quality PvE in games. ",True,False

I may be tempted to say that the game is already equal to H1Z1, and maybe even beating it. There are a few major disadvantages ie optimization which could be even better as some are still lagging and there is also some physics to improve, which both like the one in H1Z1 resembles the physics from the Farming Simulator series. Another plus is the greater variety of weapons than in the H1Z1, as well as the possibility of modifying them. Overall, I feel like I'm going to spend a lot more time in this game than in H1Z1.

"Historical strategy is not for everyone, and this is not the most accessible historical strategy game. It plays in a niche of players who want more realism and in-depth management, and who enjoy battling politics, warfare, and the complex challenges of a specific time and place.

Another rotation becomes another hour. Another hour will be blimy, where have the early morning hours gone?

"Draugen is a great (albeit relatively short) story focused adventure game in league of Dear Esther and Firewatch. It's set in the rustic village of Graavic in 1928. The game emphasize this with a black and white mode (1928 mode that I ofcourse use for full authenticity). The normal colored mode is also cool as it uses pastel-like colours to depict the antic mood of the game. The only thing that I miss in the ""fjord noir"" mode is that the sound will be on narrow bandwith like a very old tv set if you set it to black/white :) You're Edward Harding and you look for your missing sister Betty who wandered off to Norway. Lizzy, companion, jump-in-the-field side kick and game mechanic extraordinaire is adding another dimension to this game. Lizzy is playful and mischievous but also tethers to you in a way that she is a secondary angle to the story as you explore the house and vilage of Graavik. She upgrades the experience of the game in such a way that she reminds me of Elizabeth in Bioshock, minus the steampunk and shooting ofcourse but the character's dynamic interplay equals the mistery, liveliness and sense of autonomy you get from Bioshock's Elizabeth. And becaus she's so jumpy and goes all over the place to drive the story it's nice to have an accessibility feature where you will see her soundwaves from afar when she calls for you (or you call for her, which is a main feature of the game which is later being used in a pretty unique way. The game starts very lighthearted but slowly descends into.....well i'm not at liberty to tell. What I can tell is that the guys from RTG are always able to create a very distinct artistic visual mood in their games. It's an indie game but you can see that the artists come from an AAA background and infuse their exploration game with quality style and the most beautiful scenery.

"Good idea to bring bunny hopping to a newer engine, but it needs a lot more work one on the strafing and the feel of the game before its fun to play. I don't think it should copy the strafe style from the source engine but rather make something new that still feels very nice to play if not better. imo it would be best to make something that encourages you to strafe smoothly rather than something where you just have to spam strafes in order to go fast. I would only recommend buying it at this time if you're curious about it and want to support the developer. I'm saying that mainly because of the lack of content, there's only 7 maps in the game right now plus a tutorial map. I think it would be a good idea to allow people to make custom maps and upload them for other people to play, even though the game is no where near to being finished i still think it would be a good idea, because i don't think it would cost much effort to do so and it would make the game a lot more interesting. I wouldn't say its worth buying right now if you're just playing it casually and are not interested in the development of it, but i'm sure it will become a very good game as time goes on. ",True,True

"For me, Grand Theft Auto V’s extraordinary scope is summed up in two favourite moments. One is from a mid-game mission in which I flew a plane into another plane, fought the crew, hijacked the thing, and then parachuted out and watched it crash into the sea to escape death at the hands of incoming military fighter jets. Another time, whilst driving around in an off-road buggy, I got distracted by something that looked like a path up one of the San Andreas mountains. Turns out it was a path, and I spent 15 minutes following to the summit, where I nearly ran over a group of hikers. “Typical!” one of them yelled at me, as if he nearly gets run over by a rogue ATV on top of a mountain every time he goes on a hike.

It's definitely better to play with friends, but one is also quite good at it, I planted some cactus in the yard and called it Rain, quite a good replacement.

There are also some microfreezes that you don't want to get used to; an inconvenient system of hints about fossils, there would be at least a notepad where you can write down what comes out of what comes out of it (well, or I just haven't doubled in where it is displayed), because I just really forget what I need to find in order to melt some material ..

"What times of the Hitman Blood Money, when when taking the rifle out of the briefcase, the bald man went and armed it part by part, and when he put it away he disarmed it accordingly. Or when at the end of a mission there was news related to it, recounting the events and their consequences, and that varied according to your actions. Or when you could customize the weapons at ease with the pay of your missions. You even had a level of notoriety, and how you performed a mission could influence the next (which could be a bit of a ball buster but you could even pay for ""services"" to reduce that notoriety).

""Slime Rancher"" consists of three main game mechanics: Exploration, expanding and maintaining your ressources and slimes & researching new gadgets to get those tasks done more easily! You start your first day at your (still empty) ranch... Equipped with a big vacuum cleaner you now start sucking up the little slimes and hoard them in ""corrals""; what a nice little euphemism for ""cages"". Those corals can now be upgraded with special extensions, that help to keep your new little friends happy and safe inside their new homes. You can put different slime types in one corral, but not all slimes come along with each other as you might expect just by looking at their adorable faces. Each time you feed a slime  they develop the natural need to free themselves after a while from the processed food.  Their poo in form of ""plorts"" can be sold to earn money, but if a slime finds a plort from another slime race it will just eat it and voilá... you created a mixture of the two slime races! Those slimes then change their size and look and experimenting which combinations are the most pleasing looking or profitable ones can be a blast!  But be cautious: Some slimes want to be free again and will do everything they can to escape their new corrals... so alway buy them toys, feed them regulary and upgrade their corrals depending on their unique needs! Some combos can even end up into some really evil mutations that try to destroy your farm, infecting other slimes to do the same! The only way to get rid of those ""tarrs"" is shooting water at them.. and then they are gone forever! Let's talk about Slime tech a bit now: After some days you will be introduced into the research of new gadgets, upgrades and tools to gather new ressources (e.g. with pumps that you can place in the landscape) or tools to open tresure boxes that contain blueprints for more slime tech or decorations for your farm. Those gadgets make your life as a rancher easier, add more variety to the gameplayloop and help to personalize your farm... Jep it is indeed! The more you progress in the game, you explore more areas with unique biomes - each area has its own theme, slimes, architecture and music. Exploring the map calms you down a lot after a busy day, if you are stressed out often this is the perfect way to relax and forget the bad things in life for a while - in this game you get a full load of happyness spreaded all over your mind. The pleasing artstyle, combined with mood-enhancing  environmental sounds, neat animations and an ambient, perfectly fitting soundtrack by Harry Mack result in one of the most calming gaming experiences I had in years!...

"This is not a game for everyone, it has a steep learning curve and many things are not explained to you in-game and require you to use external webtools, read wikis and watch video guides. This is not to say that it's impossible to learn most of the mechanics and inner workings without them, but if you go in blindly expecting to grasp its mechanics all by yourself, you'll have a hard time. With this being said, let's start with the review. The Galaxy  The milky way in a true 1:1 scale featuring over 400 billion star systems, many of which have tens or more planets. There are many places to visit, including famous star systems like Alpha Centauri, Sirius, Canis Majoris, our solar system (Sol), etc. The engine that generates the galaxy gets a lot of its data from real world star catalogues, so most systems that are close to the player's start are from real astronomical data, while the vast majority of the rest is procedurally generated. Other than planets and regular stars, there are black holes, neutron stars, white dwarfs and nebulae to see. Flight Model  This is something this game does very well, flying in this game is so satisfying and immersive. Learning to fly is not difficult, but simply requires a bit of practice. After a while, flying becomes second nature and you'll see yourself docking and exiting stations all the while boosting and avoiding deadly collisions without dropping a sweat... most of the time anyway. Furthermore, the flight model offers a second mode, where the player has much more control over his ship's movement but disables everything that the flight computer does to correct your rotation and trajectory, resulting is easy loss of control and unwanted spinning if the pilot doesn't understand what he's doing. This is not something I'd recommend for newcomers, and even veterans unless they understand the benefits of it, so stick with flight-assist on. So what do you do in this game? You do what you want, really. The freedom is both a gift and a curse of this game, sometimes you lack a direction to go and things to do because unlike other MMOs or games in general, there isn't really a goal to this game unless you make one for yourself. You start small and humble and you make your way up, earn credits, ranks, buy ships, upgrade them, etc. This game has its flaws, it can be grindy sometimes and 'burnouts' can happen! There are 3 different 'playstyles' to this game: Combat (bounty hunting, assassination missions, joining the war effort, piracy, fighting aliens...) Trading (passenger transportation, space trucking, mining, smuggling...) Exploration (discovering planets [and immortalizing your name on them forever], discovering ancient ruins, crashed ships, taking tourists to far away places...) 'Horizons' Season Pass  I highly recommend this DLC, as it's featuring many new mechanics and additions that only improve upon the game, if you're planning on exploring a lot (landing on planets), or if you're into PvP and advanced combat (aliens) this is a must buy. Read my review for the DLC here. ",True,False
"Awesome game! It's really fun and you always try to get better. It can of course be frustrating at the beginning because everyone is better, but you get the hang of it quickly and it becomes easier.

"I think the game is fine. It is a mixture of Dark Souls and Darksiders. It has a system that takes a short time when playing at Easy and Normal difficulty, but increases the playing time by the same rate as the difficulty increases. Nice but has a bit of a familiar story. Since the English translation is half, you can break away from the texts in some places because the vocalization is in Chinese. The gameplay and variety of weapons you can use is abundant. Each weapon has its own set of special abilities, which prolongs the gameplay. I have completed the Sword and the Long Spear, you can say ""Stick and Fist"" this time and play with new weapons again. The space designs are fine. Character and enemy designs are very satisfying. Puzzles are not very difficult, so they don't bother you. I've encountered a sound bug in a few places, but it didn't bother much. His workshop is varied and plenty of community content for both character and weapons, and most of them are just fine. All DLCs are for visual purposes. You do not have to buy it. You can find more than DLC content from the workshop, but I recommend you to buy the game in full because it is always on sale and it has a very good price. ",True,True

"In my opinion, the plot is quite simple and straightforward, without any turning points, nothing surprised. With the High Resolution Texture Pack DLC, the game looks juicy enough, especially the explosions, but unfortunately there is no such thing that explodes the imagination, except that there are beautiful views in some places of the wasteland and not only. Standard Bethesda music, beautiful and simple at the same time. • Various side quests • A large number of characters, both minor and major • Huge selection of weapons and equipment, classics of the Bethesda genre • Various locations and their design component • Of course, the choice of different endings and solutions of quests • Modifying equipment looks pretty fun • A sufficient number of perks, everyone can find their own style of playing in it • A frankly simple plot in my opinion • An absolutely useless system of settlements in the game - defense and development of resources for them, this is all boring and does not attract attention • None of the Factions presented in the game I was not interested in any way, they all think too superficially, but towards the end of the game I still decided - the Brotherhood of Steel, they still have weapons, helicopters and a huge airship, and what else does a man in the wasteland need • Quite mediocre DLC, except of course Far Harbor and partly Nuka-World. DLC Automatron - honestly very disappointing with its length and ending. Even at the highest difficulty level, it was almost impossible to kill me towards the end of the game. I was a tree and stood still :) In my opinion, the game is still worth the money and the time spent, especially when I knocked out all the achievements in it! But for the DLC provided by Bethesda, I would like a more modest price tag. 7/10 ",True,False

"Back in the day Borderlands was a real game changer for me (no pun intended). It was one my first PC games bought on Steam, back when it was all sold in dollars, not even local currency. My currency was stronger compared to dollars then, though, much better times. Before Steam my life was basically piracy, buying cracked games ripped in dvds and installing them. It was fun, but Steam opened great windows, and some great games I only had the chance to play after that. Borderlands was one of the first ones from that batch. It wasn't my first great co op experience, though, that one goes for the first Killing Floor and Left 4 Dead. It was my first experience with an RPG style FPS though.  What really has always impressed me about some games that really marked my gaming life, though, is the atmosphere. Nowadays I don't feel that as much, anymore. But back in the start of the decade games like the S.T.A.L.K.E.R series, Metro, Borderlands and others had this great impact. Some time later Borderlands 2 was released and that game is still one of my favorites ever, played it for more than a thousand hours and had tons of fun playing with many friends. Still, I think the atmosphere of the first Borderlands is still a lit better than in BL2. The sound, the western feel... Just amazing. Other than that, if compared to BL2, this game also is less restricted with violence, which contributes a lot for the atmosphere and gameplay. But that's about it. I think Borderlands 2 is better than this game in every other possible aspect. This enhanced version does not feel a lot enhanced, but it is possible to see some graphical improvements. I also enjoy the changes to the HUD system and some of the sounds. It also does feel faster. But the differences to the original seem to stop here. It just a small enhancement, really. Some issues are still there, bugs and warts and all.  Is it worth full price? Not really. Definitely not if you already played the first one. Wait for a nice sale and give it a shot if you never played it.  However, I am grateful to have received this for free and had the opportunity to play this game again and do some of the achievements. Give another shot to the DLC (and some of the terrible grindy missions) and remember some points of the story, before the eventual release of Borderlands 3 on Steam. ",True,False

"Well. Very very big fan of Davey Wreden's previous game, The Stanley Parable, it was essential for me that I did not buy the last game he released and that he only announced a few days ago. First of all, The Beginner's Guide, is not a game. Nothing that exists looks like this and this ""game"" is extremely bizarre. So, considering it a normal game is a very bad idea. After I finished the game, which lasts about 1h30, I read on the internet and I found the jeuxvideo‧com test and I did not like it. (Go eat carrots at woofi jeuxvide‧com, you deserve only that) If you want to enjoy The Beginner's Guide, I strongly advise against reading and watching videos about it. Spoile is very easy in this game and can spoil the ""experience"" easily. The game currently costs $ 8 on the Humble Bundle Store, which should be $ 7.15, so it doesn't cost that much, but beware. Some people might feel robbed after completing the game and others might feel privileged to have had access to it. After, the 1h30, it's over and you won't risk opening it before forgetting it. Sharing it with other people is a good idea, however. If spending $ 8 for yourself is a big expense, then I would not advise you to buy the game. Buy this game only if you really want it. Knowing that each person is different, each person can interpret this game differently and while some people are going to like this game a lot, others just won't like it or understand it. Be very careful with your purchase here if you are going to purchase the game. I would characterize the experience of this game as philosophical and psychological at some point. It evokes concepts centered on individualism, but I do not speak more about it. The game only creates questions and doubts, without really giving an answer. Imagination and creativity are also a central element. The level design is crucial. In my opinion, I think the Beginner Guide here represents the beginner's guide to the level designer (Before I begin), but I could also be wrong, or there could be multiple meanings. The game is narrated in English, but has a lot of text translated into French and you can turn on dialogue subtitles. Being able to understand English is a big plus though. I don't know how the experience can be if you don't understand English and just read and it is clear that the experience will not be the same. Anyway, I don't really have anything else to say. It is indeed a very mysterious game. I can only advise people who want something ""special"" to play this game. Take your time and try to understand everything that is going on. Understand what you are reading and what the character is saying. Understand what the ""game"" (or level) you are playing means to you. Lots of deep thinking. I clearly see 20-page Domfulmen-style reviews of this game (Cuckoo) Anyone with huge expectations from this game will be disappointed. Just having no expectation.

"A truly wonderful game that is really worth trying. Especially with friends. The main component of the gameplay is a variety of robbery raids, raids and operations, so to speak. They consist in completely different things: ways to avoid being pursued by guards and the police, disarming alarms, planting drugs in a certain place, preparing them, and so on, much more. There is a great variety of different tasks, missions, which are gradually released and become available for download and play. You can also use certain types of equipment and weapons, which also differ in their characteristics, in the ensuing battles. And a smartly equipped team undoubtedly has a higher chance of success in a given operation. It will appeal to everyone who likes a variety of works of art on the theme of charismatic lawbreakers.

"I took it I took it I took it And throw it Shadowgrounds. Maaaaaaan! ♫ Released in 2005, Shadowgrounds is a game of crazy originality. Aliens have invaded your ""Martian"" colony (you're on Ganymede actually, but that doesn't change the taste of the mash) and you're going to have to survive, then become such a monster bugger that, frankly, we're going to doubt that you are really doing it to save your own skin. Let's get along well, this game does not offer anything revolutionary. Neither today, nor in his time, neither in form nor in substance. The scenario will take you to the settings of offices, labs, offices in labs, through mines and everything that represents the cheapouille of genre cinema. Small burst of pride - not originality - when the last levels will take you through the alien ship, with a design as clicheton as the rest. Common lines which will also be found in the characters. The heroic mecanic who makes fun of being like I'm cool, but who accepts without qualms all the suicide missions entrusted to him, in total disregard of his condition as a simple civilian surviving among supposedly much more trained soldiers. With him you will have the pretty grandpa of service, the cowardly scientist, the veteran with his brush cut that dies sacrificing himself for you and even the black who dies first, because the black always dies first. When we think that Frozenbyte is a Finnish box, we find here all the codes applied to the first degree. Shadowgrounds is risk free and is exactly what you expected. Even though there are a few attempts at personalization via a nod to Robocop, Abyss or Alien, it is the B series in full without wanting to extricate itself from it. A game that would be stamped Uwe Bowl if it didn't escape it with its lack of vulgarity and cool action. Not great, but cool. Although of a generally low difficulty, you will have some moments of fun. Especially at the beginning, during the discovery phase of this invader which comes out of the ground in corridor levels, but in the open air. Do not make the mistake like me of saving the bullets of your gun, they are, for the basic one, unlimited. Others will then be added, all of which can be customized via 3 improvements that you can buy by accumulating coins that enemies drop randomly. A little gameplay trick that has its charm, as well as the management of your flashlight which will run out and will have to ask you to turn it off to let it recharge. Managing your light in dark settings, with sometimes enemies waiting for you in a vicious corner of the room, will bring this little cop side who rakes the rooms by securing each area before progressing. You may even be surprised to be attacked from behind if you constantly forget to take a look at your motion detector. This will not prevent you from confronting some problems of the game. Sometimes your character will be blocked by a setting for no apparent reason, just like the enemy, which you can sometimes shoot without difficulty where Shadowgrounds had intended to offer you a little of stress. You also won't always know whether or not your bullets are damaging inert or metal structures. And it will happen that your character does not shoot when you ask him to. Last bug quite rare, but still present and really frustrating. Fortunately, there are many care kits (to be taken strategically) to overcome any problem during the game and each level allows you 5 lives. Enough to end the adventure without too much problem. The lifespan is 7 to 10 hours. For my part, I did one to two chapters per day out of the 11 proposed. The game is getting boring quickly enough, even if it is a pleasure to go back the next day to continue the adventure. Shadowgrounds is therefore a game without any originality, but which keeps the modest promises made and offers some joyful moments. What to leave with satisfaction, even if we doubt return one day. 5 euros a game is not theft. But it is often in big promotion which brings it down to less than a euro, and there frankly there is no longer any reason to sulk his pleasure. If you like genre cinema and want a little adventure that will remind you of old playstation games like DIe Hard Triology or Star Wars Episode 1, Shadowgrounds is a good little opus to skip. Have fun. ",True,False

"It may not be right to write reviews without leaving early access, but considering the content and price the game currently offers, it is a production that should definitely be preferred. The game, in which you can smash almost everywhere you can see with the physics engine it uses, is voxel-based, but it instantly immerses you with its light, water, flame effects, atmosphere and sounds. The feeling of destruction is very solid. You can wreak havoc with the various equipment you have, as well as the various construction equipment, cars, and trucks you can use. I should also mention that; vehicle dynamics are really better than most games. So does this game tell us to let go, go, smash, explode? There is sandbox mode, yes. However, the main part of the game is the campaign. There are several maps in the game for now. There is also a map of your own workplace. On this map, you get various tasks from your computer via email. There are main and side tasks within a job you take. When you enter the task, you plan without any time limitation at the beginning. You set a path for yourself and think about what to do and how. You ask why? Because there's an alarm of some junk that needs to be taken. When you receive this item, the alarm starts to ring and you have to flee from there within 60 seconds before the cops arrive. You have to do all the main and side missions within those 60 seconds, and of course, you have to think very cunningly. It was definitely exciting and strategic. At the same time, you have the opportunity to find many valuable items in hidden places and homes. You can improve your own equipment with the value of these items. In addition to tools such as hammer, spray, fire extinguisher, blower, there are bombs and firearms. It is beneficial to use these equipment properly in the planning phase because the use, tube, and bullets of some are limited. Except for Campaign, sandbox, a map editor has been introduced in the game, but for now, this is possible with non-game 3rd party programs. It is stated that they are willing to support the mod. In the future, I hope Steam Workshop support will come. I also want to talk more or less about the destruction, which is the aim of the main game. We've seen it in Voxel-based games and games with some destructible objects: Physics doesn't work exactly the way we want it to. However, I can easily say that this game can access the Battlefield physics engine. Yes, when you want to demolish the huge building, it is a fact that the whole building remains in the air when only one piece remains unbroken. However, in general, it is absolutely satisfactory and I would like to point out that you don't get stuck with these details when you see the game's prowess. You enjoy it when you get into a fast vehicle and jump into a house with the last gas or when you dive into a building with a bucket. As a result, if the dynamics interest you, you can get it without hesitation. Although the content it offers is not much, it is sufficient and satisfying. You have the chance to try many things with Sandbox. I also think it will become a lot more fun as it continues to be developed. ",True,True

"The Madmax universe has recently been experiencing a kind of unexpected renaissance. First, the film sequel was striking, after the premiere it became clear that the cult series can be reliably and boldly revived, guaranteeing not only symbolic praise from fans, but also a large inflow of tangible cash. It is not known which factor had a stronger impact on Avalanche studio when making the decision to transfer Rockatansky's adventures to the three-dimensional world, but it was the game of the Swedish team that intended to repeat the success of George Miller. And although it is rather difficult to talk about success in terms of purely gaming for many reasons, the peculiar charm of the production can still stick to the monitor. Universe lovers can rest easy - Mad Max presents the player with a coherent vision of a post-apocalyptic world filled with dirt, rust, in line with the spirit of the cinema prototypes. and dust. The title, without further ado, first throws us into the middle of the action (we watch a movie showing the bloody fight of the protagonist with an oversized Scrotus), and then throws us into the middle of the sandy wastes ruled by self-proclaimed gangs and organizations, mercenaries running around the desert in armor and mutants glued together from scrap metal - madmen traversing the vast wilderness in carts. The creators of the Just Cause series managed to smoothly fill the production with a variety of flavors, characteristic concepts and spectacular spots, at the end integrating the gray-and-gray atmosphere into everything, which made a very positive first impression on me - especially since the set of the action, thanks to a brief introduction, does not seem hermetic and it should not scare even people unfamiliar with the universe. The first minutes therefore promised a really promising experience. Source: ",True,False

"So, the game from CAPCOM paid off. Everything was great. Only 2 flaws were noticed: they spoiled Dante's sword style, so it became inconvenient to play, and also a little silly characters. Especially Trish and Lady. Trish is Dante's friend, the coolest girl. In the fourth part, she was generally gorgeous. And the Lady in the third part was generally the boss with whom Dante fought. And show them such suckers, as well as worried females. Horror. And also this smoker drove loaves ... Definitely, here they went too far with the colorful characters. The rest of the game is great. The meat is provided, the buzz is pouring everywhere. The presentation of the story is also excellent. Where did this V come from? We will learn this only in the second half of the game. Who is this V? We will know this only at the end of this game. Also, Kapkom is great for not deviating from the canon. Artemis, Geryon, Cerberus, and the corresponding weapons from them are all gorgeous. True, Doctor Faust could not have been inserted. V turned out to be an interesting character, a kind of master of creatures. And this is still unusual.

"An entertaining game in the RPG genre. Pretty much pulled me in and began to spend time in it quite often. Proved the 6th rank of mastery and was thinking about purchasing donat currency (Platinum).

"It's fun if you like puzzle games. I found it relaxing and enjoyable, that is until I got to a certain point of the game. I think they were onto something with this. The blue and red stages were very fun and enjoyable, and I wish they would have stuck with that concept and pushed it throughout the entire game. Although at the time of writing this review, I only have a half hour on it, it was mostly because it stopped being fun and enjoyable once I got to the green section. It was fun, enjoyable, relaxing, that is until it kicked you in the face with the green part and was more frustrating than anything. That's not to say there isn't a person that would love this game. Anybody that derives an enjoyment from hard puzzles should absolutely love this game. But I'll have to say, if you're interested because you just want to unwind on something simple and fun, you'll only enjoy the first ~20 minutes worth of this game. After that, it stops becoming relaxing and more mentally intensive. If, in the future, they release another version of this game with just blue and maybe red sections of this game expanded upon further without throwing in the green and beyond, that is something that I would completely recommend. For now, though, I'm torn on a recommendation. I can't simply say yes, and I can't simply say no. It's a game for a type of person. If you are that puzzley, determined person, then this is completely for you. If you're somebody that gets frustrated easily, this isn't for you. ",True,False

"Pros: Game revolutionized the Dead Island franchise, with parkour, which makes mobility very easy and with an adventurous footprint makes the game even more phoda! Another differential is the game being 24 hours, in which the scores at night are doubled due to the danger, and moments of escape when detected by volatiles or night hunters. The enemies are ghastly like any horror game, but some have a certain resemblance to Left4Dead2's special infected. Multiplayer PvP, in which one plays as a predator and the others as a survivor, in this mode can play up to 5 players. Very superior graphics and excellent soundtrack. Cons: As always, there are those little bugs typical of Dead Island, but not as crusty. The protagonist of the game is Kyle Crane, so all the players are him. They could have put different characters, with different abilities as in Dead Island. The price. It's not worth R $ 129.99. The ideal is to buy when you are on sale. In short: Techland finally gave in. 8/10. Super recommend! ",True,False
"Dying Light is a great survival game in the zombie-infested city of Harran. Buying this game, I thought that I was buying an average game about zombies, of which there are now in bulk, even the trailers did not inspire anything special. But I realized how wrong I was when I survived my first night in this game. Pros ┽ + Parkour. Seriously, he really fits into the atmosphere of this game. This is what Dead Island lacks, but it is also a necessary part of survival here, and adds interest and variety. + Zombies. Bored with regular, standard zombies? Receive and sign. Here you will also have zombie cops, who are indistinguishable from the real ones, as well as zombie athletes who can catch up with you and rattle about the noise in the city. As well as jumpers, runners, spitters, bouncers and thugs. To your taste and color. + Physics and murder. Crush and kick these living ghouls. You can gently break their legs with a bat so that they cannot run away from you, cut off their arms so that they cannot reach you with their unwashed fingers, fall on them and kick them with both feet, in general, by any means prove who is the real killer. + Crafting and skills. Collect blueprints and make a flamethrower out of Gordon Freeman's ordinary scrap, and even turn an ordinary table leg into a deadly stick of fate. Pump a huge number of skills and you will learn how to elbow zombies, learn to walk over their heads (in the literal sense), and many of your other fantasies will come true. + Multiplayer. Special thanks to the developers of the game for this, because you can play this game with your friends. And also the wonderful ""I am a zombie"" mode, where you can test yourself as a deadly human hunter. This is really commendable, because this is just a mode where some games are entirely composed of only this mode. (I will not point a finger at these games.) + Atmosphere. Beautiful landscapes with beautiful graphics, accompanied by scary sounds, as well as a good plot with a crazy antagonist (after all, madness is in fashion today, right?) Create an exciting atmosphere that will not let you go for the next couple of hours. Cons ▬ - Optimization and system requirements. I combine these two minuses into one, since the developers are actively working on optimization, releasing patches after patches, but, it seems to me, the system requirements have been slightly bent, although this is even an incentive to upgrade your computer. As a result: Graphics ★★★★★★★★★ ☆ [9/10] Music ★★★★★★★★★★ [10/10] Story ★★★★★★★★★ ☆ [9/10 ] Multiplayer ★★★★★★★★★★ [10/10] Gameplay ★★★★★★★★★★ [10/10] Summary ★★★★★★★★★★ [10/10] Actually , from the creators of Dead Island it was foolish to expect a bad game, I bet 10 underpants out of 10. I had to wash them after every night I spent in this game. ",True,False

"Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age, originally released for PS4 and Nintendo 3DS in 2017, is a turn-based RPG developed by Square Enix, designed and written by Yuji Horii and illustrated by Akira Toriyama, despite being the eleventh game of the series, it is not necessary to play the previous games as there is no chronological order. It is impossible to tell the story of the game without any kind of spoiler, which is actually a very strong point, several doubts will arise in the progression of the game, but throughout the story everything is very well explained, in short, the main character is chosen defeat the ""Dark One"" and bring peace to the world of Erdrea by repeating a legend that took place in the era of heroes. DQXI maintains the tradition of old RPGs, turn-based game with level up system, spells unlockable at certain levels, as well as skill points acquired when leveling up, these points can be used to acquire skills, increase status and unlock others spells. All characters have a temporary boost in battles called Pep Up, the character has a kind of blue aura, this ability increases the status and releases unique abilities that can be combined with other characters. There are several items to collect during the game, which can be collected in bright spots on the map or by dropping enemies, being used to forge equipment or to complete side-quests. DQXI was one of the best RPGs I've ever played, a solid game with an excellent story, the beginning doesn't get very exciting, but it gradually improves as the characters are introduced to the group and their motivations are revealed. The characters are charismatic, there are several side-quests and mini-games, it has everything an RPG needs, don't think twice about buying this game if you enter a 50% promotion, it will be worth every penny spent, DQXI is the type of game that ends and you still want +.

"One of the most underrated games on steam. This is Super Smash Bros on PC.

If you never played SSB before, it is still a great alternative, as most of SSB abilities are available here, and unlike SSB, you're the one who chooses which abilities you're carrying with you.

"Greetings This is my first review.   At first I was disappointed becasue my named got changed from Sesshomaru to Sesshoomaru. After playing almost two years now I got used to my name and even my friends call me Sess now days.    This game is a fun game to sit down and play during a long day at work or school. You really do feel like you are a Lord ruling over your own villages in a bigger empire picture with all the other Lords and Ladys and helping your fellow players along the way.  In this game is where you can met people all over the world and you can help each other out. You can work together and fight together and its also great way to play with your friends too.    I also like how Stronghold has added more quest to to earn cards and wheel spins. Good job! I think it would be cool if Stronghold have automonks to send out cure disease or even bless of your own parishes. How about away to save you village like the way you save your castle? So all and all I have fun playing and excited about what new upgrades will come out next.   Here is helpful tip, When its say ""steam needs to be online"" which steam is online, well don't threat do I as do.  Right click on the mini steam icon in the task bar and click on stronghold and play. I hope that helps if it dose leave me a thumbs up!   You can come follow me in House 3 in World 3 eng.

"- The game is open world that is wide and very detailed. Nature, forest, Khao Phrai, weather, there are hundreds of villages or an extremely large town. Walking in the city, if you don't mark first where you are going, you will surely get lost. The people were walking around The shops that were located were lined up. Get the atmosphere of the city of civilization. - The game system looks very simple, focusing on general teeth. There is a counter of the escape scene, using magic mixed with drugs, create a bomb, create the oil that is used to plaster the weapon to attack the enemy stronger. Which when it comes together while playing it is very fun I met one kind of teacher, used a kind of medicine / oil. Encountering another type, throwing explosions to dissolve magic power Or you can use magic to kill each other. - Mini games, playing card games are well made. Play and enjoy a lot. The feeling of playing yuki in the past Send spy. Draw cards repeatedly. Load more ATK combos. Send X2 power buff cards. Close with sending a field card, block power hahaha, cool to the point that it's being developed as a standalone game - the main quest is very long. Choosing answers that affect different endings Including small events that may occur if we choose another answer throughout the play. But the coolest point of this game is """" - side quests. This game is very, very heavy. Not like walking from point A to delivery B, or going out to kill only this number of monsters and complete the quest. But every sub-quest has its own story. There are various events where we can choose to finish the quests. Geralt (myself) also has a guide to explain things during this quest throughout this quest. Which just a normal side-quest has already pumped a lot of time to play Here there are also competitive quests. Hunt rare monsters, treasure hunts, and challenge Duel throughout the kingdom. Stealing Rare Cards - The details of the game are so great that you don't really know what to find words to describe. It's not just full But it is a step closer. For this game, the size has not yet been added. DLC is still extremely large I did not feel that I had to cut the game to other DLCs and also have free DLC that is worth more. Even if you buy the full price. But if there is no time to play, then another story. You can wait and reduce it :) - talking about some disadvantages Buck has some sporadic But not so serious that it affects the play (the patch has been fixed almost all), some bugs, dev has released it. Like a horse bug Just kidding yourself, slapping jokes in the DLC, and when you're playing, is it a disadvantage? Hub ...? ",True,False

"How do I even begin to review this masterpiece. Best sniper game on the market for sure and especially best sniper game that takes place in the World War II era. I had really high expectations regarding this game and they broke every single one of them, whatever went wrong in Sniper Elite III like the AI for example has been fixed in SE4. I also like how Stealth is less nuanced and you can go full rambo if you so choose. I really like the overhaul to the CQB takedowns you can pull off and the revamped kill cam is just hilarious to see sometimes. I also love the new added element of environmental kills and added killcams for those kills. Gives the game a whole new dynamic to me. The best thing about this game are the realistic mechanics a real life sniper would come in contact with. Unless you play on Cadet difficulty you can't just point your crosshair at someone's head and expect a instant headshot on him. You really have to take the distance of the shot and the wind in consideration and account for the bullet drop, which is even worse on silenced ammo, and adjust your aim accordingly.  And yes there is the new Kill Hitler DLC, but I honestly don't mind this is the third time they made it. Honestly I can't think of anything more fun to kill Hitler by sniping his jewels. This is a great game, and I've waited a long time for it. For me personally hands down the best game I bought this year. 10/10. ",True,False

"Creativerse is an open world multiplayer crafting/building game. Along the same aspects of Minecraft but with a lot of extras. Obviously with the success of Minecraft (Mojang 2011) there have been tons of games that are around the same aspect of being able to build whatever your imagination can think of. Well Creativerse lets you do that. Now there's two different versions of the game currently. Obviously there's the Free to Play version but ther's also the Creativerse - Pro version ($19.99) which gives you the features to create multiple worlds and be able to customize them with additional advanced options, a glider to be able to fly through the skys as you're looking for somewhere to build, a flashlight to be able to see in front of you in dark areas, additional backpack slots (+20), +100% more stamina and you're able to claim 2 stakes for free in every world. Even without paying for the Pro version there's tons of stuff you can do in Creativerse. You can travel through a gigantic world that has wide a variety of enviroments each with creatures. Underground is just as immersive but it's a lot more dangerous than the overworld, so if you're looking for a survival challenge underground is the place to be. There's day/night cycles, weather cycles, temperature and tons of other things that make this game beyond amazing. As for building there's a blueprint system that you can follow and build amazing structures step by step as it shows you how or you can just go off on your own and create whatever your mind feels like. There's over 400 pieces of material to build with, wireless machines and complex interactions such as creature spawning, block manipulation, checkpoints and much more. If you're the type that likes to play sandbox games alone you can build your own private world and build to your hearts content. But even with a private world you have the ability to invite your friends so they can see your creations. Meeting new people and seeing amazing designs is very simple in Creativerse, you have the ability to browse through live player worlds. When you do that you have the ability to visit the world or stake your claim and make your own home in that world. Get out there, get inspired and build alongside this wonderful community that is Creativerse. ",True,False

"F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin | October 18, 2020 | [★★] In my opinion, It is a very clean made game. Throughout my play-through, I've never encountered a thing that it shouldn't be there. I think being super linear helps a lot in that case. Gameplay is pretty much shoot and kill then enter the next level - enemy spawn there and do the same. The AI's movement felt generic making them easy to read. I've only died 2 times (Excluding those failed grenade attempt) throughout the campaign in Normal mode. I can't say otherwise on other difficulty but it was an easy course game. The story doesn't really give a lot until it finally became clear by reading through massive hundred journals scattered around the game. It sometimes wasn't fun reading those but at least it picked up half the game that it makes me intrigue and engage with what's happening. I've never actually played the first one and this one make me want to check it to see what I've been missing. Overall experience is a big thing for me and sadly this just gave me a flat one. I knew horror is one of the main theme of this game, but I've never felt that. Jumpscape doesn't really bothers me specially with no consequences unlike Dead Space where those who freak you, can actually kill you and that makes it more terrifying. I just wish this game have that. ",True,False

"Well, it's already almost 300 hours since I started playing Dota 2. I think that with this journey I can already give a review with knowledge of the game. It is a very good game that traumatizes beginners, really if you come from LoL (as it was in my case), it will cost you a little to understand it at the beginning. What stands out the most in the game is the use of the items in the store. Unlike LoL there are some items that are very complex. The same goes for character abilities, there are some very good abilities unlike LoL, which are simpler. And what about the community? Well, there are some flamers who whistle if you do things wrong, but if you already have knowledge of what to do, that flamer son of his mother will calm down and even praise you if you do things right. From my point of view, it seems like a well-made MOBA that really deserves to be better known, unfortunately Valve does not promote their product as much as Riot games does. PS: Maybe there is a Riot cpp that reads this and let me tell you that I also dedicated their hours to LoL, and I even have m5, m6 and almost m7 masters with various characters. ",True,False

"-Unique gameplay mechanics which makes it standout from usual traits of this genre of games. -Great environmental,graphical (effects, textures and model) design. -One of the most if not the most gore-filled, violent and revolting game of this current gen. -Free for existing owners. -Superior art direction conveying the gore and horror petrified halls of hell. -Tons of unlockable content,modes and different endings. -Improving on almost all aspects of its predecessor. -fairly priced for the content it has to offer -Gameplay tends to become repetitive fairly quick. -Transparent storyline. -Unevenly placed checkpoints. -Choppy voice-acting. -Limited interaction with the vast environment. -Fickle stealth mechanics which causes too many sudden death encounter progressing throughout the game.   The story itself follows a lost soul trapped in the depth of the horrifying hellscapes without any memories of his former life. Slowly its revealed of what's the protagonist's backstory, he was a ruler of an ancient land who made a Faustian bargain with the Red Goddess. In-story, he is referred to as both Nimrod by the Goddess and other trapped souls some of whom still have their memories, blaming the protagonist for them being destined to hell because of his rather negative acts he performed while alive. As the protagonist wanders through the wastelands of hell, he discovers a possibility of escaping through the aid and guidance of the Red Goddess. Eventually, he travels to the Red Goddess' lair to learn how he can be set free from the torments of hell. The game itself is a mix-match of Puzzle, Exploration and Stealth. The first person perspective is highlighted mostly during the exploration. The environments are highly detailed with hints of finding notes and other important things that leads you to a better understanding of what's going on. The wormhole of gore gets worse with every step people mutilated beyond recognition, pools of blood etc. Uses of tools provided such as torches opens new paths but attracts more enemies. Stealth here is the most highlighted mechanic which gets u through most of the later stages. Camouflage by hiding in mounds of corpses is crucial to the game's progression. Puzzles in particular is pretty easy mainly consisting of finding and delivering items. Certain types of enemies can also be avoided in a puzzle like manner with the help of the aid of notes and some others by yourself. Overall sometimes it may come off as all shock, and no substance. The take on hell is amazing, but the underlying gameplay can become frustrating.  You will begin your journey as a tormented soul within the depths of hell, without any memories about your past. The special ability to control people on your path, and even possess simple minded demons, gives you the necessary measures to survive in the extreme conditions you are in. By exploring the hostile environment and interacting with other weary souls of the hellscape, the protagonist will soon understand that there is only one way to escape from Hell, and it will require meeting the mystical Red Goddess. By summing up notes the storyline and dialogues are revealed. The narration slowly hints at some lore with the eventual progression and slowly reveals the ""Big Picture"". Definitely the best aspect it shines the most. Brilliant depiction of hell and its miseries with the help of Unreal Engine 4 delivers on a solid experience. Great sound design and music, even though it isn't much noticeable some dialogues don't sync up which makes the voice acting feel a bit lacklustre. The game itself is very demanding maybe because of the absence of optimization but didn't notice anything huge while running on a system based on (gtx 1050 ti,16gb ram) frame rates are pretty solid too. Nothing sevre got bought to my attention. Safe to say no major bugs in this incarnation. Agony is a game not made keeping the mainstream gamers in mind so it's obviously not everyone's cup of tea. But for those willing to experience it the game ensures a solid horror experience. Overall a reasonably priced horror experience. ",True,False

Loved this game. Never got a chance to play the Lost Chapters expansion so getting to play it this time around with better graphics really was an experience. My only complaint is that the combat is a little dated and clunky and I had quite a few minor UI bugs that were exceptionally annoying. All in all though I'm definitely glad I picked this game up.

Bottom line: It is because of its originality, despite some (no less important!) Shortcomings, that the toy is definitely 10/10! :) P.S. maniacs who don't kill you and give you a little boost - thank you! :)) ",True,False

"All developers should pay attention to how to make a real remaster, a game remade without losing its essence and with improved quality. What was already good and innovative for the time just got better. The gameplay is incredible, easy and simple. I thought it would be complicated because on the N64 lever you had to open your hand and have thumb control on the analog and I particularly liked playing on the keyboard more than on the joystick. I'm reliving my glorious childhood vacation days when I stopped all day to pass the level, look for keys and the best: I didn't have the memory pack so I had to keep the console on to be able to continue the game.

The plot is now served directly. The entourage of Japan in the 16th century is transferred to all 12 out of 10 and is slightly seasoned with mysticism. The landscapes in the game are simply breathtaking. There is no more variety in weapons, but many different skills and tools have appeared in the prosthesis. Bosses now have 2-3 full HP strips and the ability to inflict a fatal blow without completely destroying HP if you quickly knock down stamina on a boss or a mob.

"Good day! Today we will explore the recipe for the perfect game. Write everything down, and don't forget any of the ingredients below when making your own cocktail. And be sure to respect the proportions! Today's cocktail slogan will be: So let's get started! First, take the largest container and add the main idea there. In our case, we will add the idea of ​​a cyberpunk future. Then add the most important ingredient there - dialogues. No perfect mix is ​​possible without it! Dialogue is like wine. They need exposure, so it is better to take care of their preparation in advance (at least 3 years before cooking). Due to all the complexities, this is an extremely rare product. Not all craftsmen are able to create all the conditions for perfect dialogues. Then pour everything into a shaker and mix, but do not shake. Then take a small container and add some visual to it. Don't forget that the main idea of ​​our mix is ​​cyberpunk, so you need more bright colors, especially in pink and purple shades. Next, add a handful of characters. And spice it up with music. The quality of the latter is also worth paying attention to, because it is its diversity that will make the cocktail more sparkling and tasty. Pour everything into the same shaker and shake well. You can also add any amount of carmotherine to your taste. The more it is, the higher the immersion. That's it, the cocktail is ready! Hope you master this recipe and make your own perfect game. And if you cannot get all the necessary ingredients in perfect condition, then there is always the opportunity to try a ready-made cocktail! You can always try this mix in the bar And also at the moment another recipe for the perfect cocktail that can take you away is being developed. But that's a completely different story ...

"AND TODAY FRIENDS THE GAME IS OFFICIAL OUT OF EARLY ACCESS ON THE BASIC, CONGRATULATIONS !!! PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS, better known as PUBG, is a game that everyone has heard of. I think that there is no such person who would be indifferent to her. The game is either loved or hated. It is a fact. After playing quite a lot of hours (350 at the time of writing the review), I decided to make my final opinion on this, in my opinion, a masterpiece. First, it should be recalled that the game was already released on the basis of 12/21/2017 (this is like a gift for us for the NEW YEAR). Since the game was released today, it is characterized by all sorts of bugs, lags, and so on. The most important thing is that we are constantly working on the game and releasing updates that adjust the game, making it even better. If we compare what was from the very beginning with what is now, then tremendous progress will be seen. Let's go further. What is this game like? She is, as I wrote at the beginning, a battle royale. We and about a hundred other players are thrown out of the plane onto the map, where we are to become the king of the island. There are enough loot places on the map, so there won't be any problems. The game will not be able to drag on for a long time, since the blue zone will not limit the playing area after a certain period of time. Airdrops are not uncommon in the game, which is good news. The presence of transport (which, by the way, is sufficient) will facilitate your movement around the island. We have the option to play solo, duo or squad. Well, if you are a terminator, you can go solo against squads. You can play both in the first and third person. Next, I would like to analyze certain points in the game that, in my opinion, are of interest to many. one). Cheaters. Yes, there are cheaters in the game. How much without them. BUT! Having played more than 350 hours, I met them at most ten times. The reviews in which the authors write that ""AAA READERS DO NOT GIVE BENDING NORMALLY, and the game is given 0/10"" are surprising. You just have to accept that someone has crooked hands (that you cannot hit from 250 meters) and a hard hearing (that you cannot hear opponents in the house). 2). Is skill important? Quite a difficult question in this game. Of course, the ability to play here has a place to be. The reaction and some kind of tactics in the game are important, and you should not forget about attentiveness. You can constantly run and kill everyone, but there will be a person who will just sit in a bush ... 3) Optimization. Ooooh, this is my favorite topic. Guys who want to comfortably play on medium games in a game that is already based on computers with 460 vidyahy - naturally it will lag with you (although it will start, you can play on low ones with drawdowns - I checked, and then you will have it not playable). At least a Min card GTX 1050 requires our favorite game. The game requires good enough hardware. BUT! The game is being optimized (and it will be pretty soon, and you and I can play at 60fps stably). On tests it gives out significantly more FPS than in the usual one. With the global update, I think the number of players will increase as they can play on their weak PCs. 4) Cases and more. There is an in-game currency with which we buy caseics, which we can sell or open. And there it all depends on the randomness. Personally, I opened about 20 cases, didn’t come out in plus, but didn’t go into minus either. The game pays for itself completely. So, if you feel sorry for 900 rubles, do not regret it. You will multiply this amount several times. Well, for now, that's all I would like to say. The review will be edited as it comes out and updates and new thoughts come into my head. The review was written on 12/21/2017. 10 out of 10. ",True,False

"Best Detective Game. An interesting plot, well-developed Los Angeles of the 40s, intricate affairs. And what is only the animation of faces. Of the minuses, only a lock of 30 fps and problems with launching on Windows 10 (You need to run steam as administrator or look for patches). ",True,False

"Awesome game. Stopped playing after awhile because I reached the point where there is almost nothing to do. Then they updated and I had to start over again. Did that and reached the same point where there isn't much else left to do. Now I am waiting for the next update to maybe start over again and see what else they might introduce. No doubt that this game is worth it. How much is it worth it? I have an exam in couple of days and yet I still constantly open the game, even though my colony is at about cycle 850 and there isn't really anything that can kill my colony. No doubt that this game is on the path to being amazing, now it is only awesome. ",True,True

"Similar to factorio but cheaper! It is a game that puts the requested items in the big square in the center. You can carry your items on rails, cut them, combine them, rotate them, and color them. You can also combine colors. I have a problem with my eyes and it is difficult to distinguish the colors, but it was very helpful because it displayed some additional characters. Although it is a rail, I will lay a line by dragging the mouse. It is difficult to do this all the way to the end, so I would like to make heavy use of the copy and paste function that is released from the middle. To use copy and paste, points will be accumulated by continuing to put in the items required for unlocking, so you can paste by consuming those points. It's a good idea to put this item in multiple lanes early to earn points, as you'll need to spend more points to do large-scale copy and paste. Especially in the final stage, it is mostly copy and paste. There are no enemies like factorio, so it is recommended for those who want to rearrange their imports in a peaceful world. ",True,False

"Awesome game, but why didn't she hook me up for a long time: /. The first gta I had contact with, good gameplay, graphics, sound, story, etc., even very good. I recommend it but ... not for the price. I am talking about the steam price, I bought the game for PLN 120, which is half the price of steam, but in my opinion it is too much money for such a game. Of course, if someone works / has money like ice, let him buy it blind, but for people who do not have that much money, I suggest waiting until the game drops to PLN 60-80, because in my opinion it is more or less worth that. For these 120 zlotys, I suggest you buy two new wolfensteins and foreign insulation (or whatever you want), but I recommend against gta for this money. Of course, this is only my opinion and everyone may be different: P. The game gets 8.5 / 10 from me. ",True,False

"Cool game. We play as a dangerous macaroni and try to climb the criminal ladder. Fat from hamburgers Michael from Univer will help us with this. In the beginning, we are sent to fight against Hitler's main brother, namely against Mussolini. Then we return to NY and kill the fat men at the breweries, because our deceased folder owes money to the Jews. We sit out in the zone and listen to fucking stories from an old man named Leo. We return to NY again. This time, we bury a blind eye and kill Walt Disney, who has the voice of Repetur. And then ... I don't think it makes sense to go on. Just play this game. She's worth her money. Rating: 9 Marlon Brando out of 10. ",True,False
R6 is really amazing and fun to play. You need to learn the ropes to double the fun and you gotta find the operator suits you. A trapper? A roamer? Maybe a sneaky one? Or you just like getting your machine gun and destroying everything you see (not really works). You will love it! Just don't give up when you first try the game. You will learn much from pro videos too. Have fun! ,True,False
"Very lonely. When I was playing, I thought of Duncan Jones' ""Moon"" more than once, so the face of Sam Rockwell was automatically brought into my mind. Many tributes to ""2001 Space Odyssey"" and ""Blade Runner"", but not only always immersed in the classic back, excellent creativity and suspense, excellent level design, the creation of a lonely atmosphere is also remarkable.

"Very little Spoiler warning ahead: LiS: Before the Storm was quite interesting. I loved the game as Max and it became so much to me. I cryed so often and the characters who where created felt like family. I Pre- Ordered this game because i was flashed when I heard I get to play more of the Story and know a bit more about the whole. So i was completly flashed when i played the first Episode. So full of nostalgia and see all the old AND finally Rachel was a complete burst. I played the 2nd Episode and it was ok. I was able to kiss the new character i truely love and wanted to know how these Story´s matches together. Then today the last Episode came out and it took quite a bit but today was the day and I couldn´t wait. It took me round about 3 hours and im kinda confused. The Ending wasen´t the Ending i wanted and as in the Original we only had 2 ""END- Desicions"" wich was normally completly fine but this was different. If you just look at the game itself I can recommend it. If i look at the game out of my perspective: I can still recommend it. But it wasen´t the last thing i wanted to make out of this whole Story and I´m left out now with a bit of an unsafe feeling wich wanted more and didn´t became it. Maby thats all why im feeling not quite fullfilled with the last episode. But none of the less its a fantastic game wich every ""Real Player"" should play and think about decisions, life and much more. If you read till now i gotta thank you for reading and i hope you will love the whole Series as much as I do ... :hearth: ",True,False
