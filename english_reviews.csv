"Bot Colony is an ambitious title, aiming to provide a non-scripted story by allowing you to freely converse with robots. If you enjoyed literary works like 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep', Isaac Asimov's Robot series, movies like 'Space Oddysey 2001'(not one of my favorites though) or Anime like 'Ghost in the Shell' and 'Psycho-Pass', you'll find a similar setting here.  An important remark is that most of the gameplay is text (or speech) conversations, which at times can be both agitating and humorous, and that might not appeal to everyone.  Currently, the game is made of 2 episodes: Intruder and Arrival.   You have 2 objectives. The first one is erasing evidence of a thief breaking into the house, by commanding a robot (Jimmy). The other one is an investigation mission, which you can do at the same time, in which you question Jimmy about what happened at the house in the last 48 hrs. Jimmy will be saying some of his remarks/facts while moving around the house, which can be used as hints to what to ask. Although it might be a struggle at first, once you get used to commanding Jimmy (i recommend reading through  ). This is the first ""real mission"". it consists of multiple objectives that you'll discover while playing, talking with the receptionist, finding your luggage, , getting a ride to your next location. A memorable moment was the talk with Charlie, a cleaner bot who'll help you with getting your ride.     I enjoyed my playtime with BotColony and I'll be waiting for any further updates. If you have any interest on how the robots operate and your interaction with them, I'm sure you'll also enjoy it. While if you're only focused on 'the result' or why the robot isn't doing what you 'clearly' are telling it, you might have a rough ride. Keep also in mind that the game is an early access title, and not everything is polished yet. I played mostly through typing, Voice recognition is pretty decent with the new Microsoft API, but i find it more convenient to type. That said, voice recognition is not made by the developers and is one of the best available on the market. Also the devs like to hear community feedback, so feel free to drop your thoughts on the forums.",True,True

"If you're like me and you like a tug-o-war like game just like the mods/maps in WC3 and Starcraft2 then you'll find this game right up your alley.

Didn't reach the end game yet due to the online servers being down. And i don't want to start over from scratch on a new character. But so far the game is extremely fun for me. I enjoy the combat and skills. And its possible to make so many builds with the classless progression. So far only 3 acts are available. But from what i've seen about the end game.

"After the long time spent hoping for a game that involved smashing Zombies and a sense of humour this game satiated that desire.

This game showed me up and the expansion was well worth it.",True,False
"Purity without a touch of vulgarity and platitude. Hatred without restrictions of common sense. Love without saccharine. A few distinct personalities, caught in the circumstances or making their own mistakes. Which tragedies will they have to face? How will they overcome or succumb? This story has its unique charm and style. Outstanding visuals and fitting music, blending in with the story. The characters are well-written and alive. The text on its own has a great language. This story is filled with beautiful sayings and events. It has quite a share of surprises and sudden moments which will catch you off guard. It's a long game and I'd prefer the last chapter to be shorter. After the promise of the final closure, I was waiting far too long for it to actually happen. Some music tracks are way too repetitive, especially the happy ones. And even though I really like the way how it's written, the amount of ""......"" is sometimes too annoying. In the end I liked this game, I liked this story. And I really liked some of the characters who felt like good acquaintances of mine in the end.  I picked up this game because of it being constantly called ""the best visual novel on Steam"". I finished it looking at all the entangled threads being tied together in a single picture. How different the stories told here are and how well they all attach together.",True,False

"Wow, just like I expected I just really love RhinoGearz Visual Novels. The writing, story telling and just in general how he likes to form romance stories and relationships just really fits with my own personal likings. You play a young guy entering a magic academy and finding the love of your life in it. The relationship development is really nice and I also really enjoyed the overall story apart from the romance itself. Considering that you also get around 4 hours of story and that it is only 2 euro, I will never understand why his games dont take off more. For this price you wont find anything better on steam when it comes to romance VNs and just overall positive story telling.  If you are looking for a positive and very relaxing read then highly recommended. There is no r18 content though so if you are looking for that you might want to look elsewhere. If you care about story though and not just visuals then its really great. Apart from that the art itself is also pretty good and really if you consider the price you cant expect anything more from this VN. 9/10 Check out my Curator Page:",True,False

"I played this game with a friend and honestly, its a blast! Being infected is really fun as well as being non-infected. There is usually great teamwork between players and people are usually pretty chill (in my experience). There are skins that you can obtain for free which look nice. If you want to win, it is necessary to use good teamwork and this is what I like about the game. Lastly, I just love the animation where you transform into your 'beast form', its really cool xP There are some graphical errors I have found.  ex. If you go to the steam overlay and back into the game, your mouse cursor does not disappear and is just on the screen when you are in the first person perspective playing the game.",True,False

"I'll start by saying I generally don't play hidden object games, the sheer number of them in the market and the fact that so many of them seem to look the same always made me feel like I wouldn't enjoy them.  I was convinced to play this one, though, and I'll admit that I was pleasantly surprised.  None of the puzzles or challenges were too difficult, but even so, there was enough variety that it kept me entertained through to the end (though I did miss the 4 hour time limit for the achievement by about 15 minutes, which meant I had to play through a second time). The only issue I had was during nearly every puzzle, I found myself backing out of them by clicking too close to the bottom of the screen for one reason or another, which did get annoying after a while.  Even after playing the game for hours I didn't seem to be getting any better when it came to this, maybe something like a back arrow somewhere on the screen as an alternative to clicking on the bottom portion to backtrack could help with that.  This is a pretty small complaint though, and most likely something that most people don't have any problems with.",True,False
"Finished the game,  if you're a Korra fan  if you're not. + Combat is fun it's your basic 'Beat'em Up' + Concepts are interesting & lets you try different things than just montonous combat + Lots of secrets to find if you're into that kind of thing + Skill shop so fighting is completely repetitive + Story is interesting enough to intice the Korra fans to keep playing + Cutscenes are cool and fully animated + Pro.Bending. - There's only like a total of 10 models in this game - Little to nill replayability - Combat is a little choppy at times (not exactly fluid & smooth) - Can't fluently change from one bending to another unless in avatar state It's worth the 15 bucks if you like the Legend of Korra series & you've followed up for the last 2 seasons. So the combat is fun & simplistic, you just beat people to a pulp and move to the next segment. They make it feel really good to counter and throw back punches. Naga running segments is essentially like a runner-mode where you slip and slide through obstacles to get to the next segment, and though it's fun it feels a bit contrived. However, the enemies get stale after awhile there's like 10 models and 3 different palette swaps for each one. However, I do keep in mind that kind of budget the developers were probably working with and can empathize the constriction on the lack of diverse enemies/help from an AI. For a license game The Legend of Korra does alright to stand on its own considering the game is only 15 bucks, but most likely confusing to those who haven't seen the show. *****WARNING: SPOILERS/SECRET CODES BEYOND THIS POINT****** In case you do buy the game I've got some goodies: (note I'm using generic commands since everyone's layout is different)",True,False

The ways with which interactions was used to tale the stories of the Edith Family was brilliant, and the tale themselves were really good.

If I had to find cons, there was some little bugs, e.g Elizabeth throwing salt/ammo/coin through wall. Also, I got stuck few times, whenever it was Elizabeth blocking the door and not moving, or me doing parkour-thingies and somehow managing to get stuck in a small gap, it was a bit annoying to load from the last checkpoint.  But those weren't game breaking at all, so it's all good if a great game has a small bugs like that!

"One of my top 5 most played games in my steam library! The sounds, the scenery, the players and the different maps make this game really well-made. There are many opportunities that you can make so even after long hours it won't be boring unlike other games, because you can play as Squad Lead, Infantry, Tank operator, Scout, Pilot or simply Support (logistics and/or super FOB-ing with TOWs and mortars). Not to mention the multiple factions with their own weapons, vehicles, tools and buildings respectively. If you wanted to compare with other games, I would say a really realistic game as Escape from Tarkov (no hitmarks), open-world with vehicles as Arma 3, respawn system and customization as in Red Orchestra and Rising Storm series, but if you just want to kill everyone because you are used to the fast paced CoD series, then this game is not for you: a map can take up to 1,5 hours! Regular updates with the feedback of players are always released by the helpful devs! And one more thing: the game isn't dead, the servers are mostly full.

Great game. 1k+ Hours. Hard to learn. Impossible to truly master. So many possibilities and variables. Teamwork crucial. Time consuming (games can be 40-70 mins long). Watch is great too.

"I really enjoy Telltale games so I'm always on the lookout for similar games and The Descendant is about as close as it gets, albeit less refined. The voice work was a little rough in parts, ranging from serviceable to good depending on the character and the visuals while nothing special did the job, they went for the cel shaded look ala The Walking Dead and co. Gameplay was what you'd expect, walk around finding clues, press the correct button at the correct time and select whichever story choice you prefer. Now for the bad though, it's technically not great (is this genre cursed?), it's a Unity engine game that's capped at 30fps, you have to edit the registry to fix this which is easy enough to do but you'll notice straight away the game is optimised for 30fps, even on medium settings I couldn't hit 60fps in all situations (although to be fair, I did most of the time). So my advice would be to uncap and switch to medium settings unless you're using something better than a GTX 970, there's high and very settings above medium for those of you rocking big boy GPUs.",True,False

"This is the first time I think a game has hooked me so much. Getting this game about 4 days ago, and putting almost 10 hours a day into it, is a worrying amount, but the game just hooks you. It all comes down to some basic aspects that make this game so good, from a gameplay standpoint: The movement and the weapons. The movement is pretty simple, you run around as you might expect, but the dash is really what makes it. Its far enough to get some distance and dodge if you need to, but is also great for when you want to jump around enemies to backstab them, or fighting multiple enemies, jumping from one to another as you see fit. The movement is simple enough for anyone to use, but also allows people with fast hands to really take advantage of some of the games mechanics. The movement puts you in a position where you can be almost perfectly in control of how much damage you take. I think that it has hit a very nice balance. The combat is in a word, satisfying. With a number of different weapons, and a number of different play styles available for each, it really opens the game out with what you can do. The boons and upgrades that you get can also be attributed for this, giving different bonuses, which can compound certain playstyles, or make you switch up your build a little bit for something more fun. The point is, there are loads of different options for you to choose from. Most of the weapons specials, are slower and higher damaging attacks, and when you get that killing blow with them, it does feel good to do so. I think that's what makes the combat so good and keeps me playing so much. *POTENTIAL SPOILERS BELOW* Outside of the gameplay, the story and mini-stories had me wanting to keep playing too, due to the way in which it is revealed to you. Throughout the game, you find out more about Zagreus' mother, what happened between her and Hades, and the change of characters thoughts and attitudes. However there are tons of other character interactions throughout the game that you can take part in, from simply chatting with people in the House or those within the different areas of the Underworld, and being able to give gifts to those same characters in return for some goodies for you to use. Not only are these interactions fun and interesting to do, to find out more about these characters, and how they interact with the others around them.  I think the revealing nature of the story, really kept me motivated to keep playing, as I really wanted to reach the end, beat Hades and see Persephone again, to keep learning more about what happened. *END OF SPOILERS* Overall, I am more than pleased with the story(ies) and its execution. It's great that you can get as invested into them as you like through your choices of who to talk to and who to care about. I have only reached the end of the main story so far, but I am very satisfied with it. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I think that this is a game that many people will enjoy, even those who, like me, was never really into rogue-likes at all. I would definitely recommend to everyone.",True,False

"An excellent game with a unique and entertaining combat system, wonderful art design and a motif built from a diverse array of myths and cultures. However the game isn't perfect, I've had my fare share of crashes (ALWAYS SAVE BEFORE ALT-TABBING!) and there are a few boss fights where it feels like the game isn't being fair or clear on what it wants me to do. Also there are a few characters that feel (to me at least) like duds, but in a roster of 20+ characters they cant all be winners and with so many options I'm sure anyone can find at least 2 they like enough to stick with to the end. Not much to say about the plot, its nothing groundbreaking just mostly good, but with compelling characters. As a whole I do recommend the game but you should probably wait for a sale.",True,False

"I got this game for 50 euros or so, i preordered it, and I think it's worth of it. Main story is made to be played in about 15 hours or so. The game has some bugs, but not much. Now let's talk about ratings. 1. Graphics Graphics are incredible, a lot of details, great looking cut scenes, enemies have a lot of details, even on lower spec computers. I have mid-high tier computer, and i could play game on 40fps on some great medium settings. 2. Gameplay (combat, jumping, side task, main missions, RPG stuff...) Combat is the most important thing in this game and it's soo ♥♥♥♥*** great, i could even say incredible. Yes it has a small number of bugs but these bugs are irellevant and I passed game without any problems. I saw some bugs in dodging, i mean, sometimes i click dodge button, in my case its CTRL and usually it works, i mean almost always works, maybe it won't work in 1/50 times so it's doesn't matter. Second most important gameplay feature is parkour or jumping, in this game it has a lot of jumping, flying enemies so you have to jump to hit them etc... The parkour is most important in last mission with cap America and it's done great. Sometimes I had problems with Caps wall running but with newer patches it was fixed. Parkour mehanics are simple, with cap you have wall-running, with Miss Marvel and Black Widow you have some kinda hands/grapple hooks that you throw on the ground or tree/pipe... Hulk has simple jumping. Thor and Ironman don't have any parkour mehanics, simple jumping with flying. Side task and main missions are important in every game, same as in Marvel's Avengers, so let's begin. First mission is tutorial and it is showing how to play with every single hero. Personally i like these type of level design, looks like design from God of War (2018). If you have to jump on something or destroy it, it has some kind of a mark, white stripes, red colour on it... When you use tactical awareness, it shows you current objectives and some kind of a soul that shows where you should go. Missions are usually of same kind. Go destroy more enemies, stay in some circle and let Jarvis (your supercomputer) to hack doors, go to elevator destroy some enemies, stop reactor or hack communication or take over defence... There are 2 ways of doing that, capturing zones and guarding them from AIM destroying some kind of generators and stop reactor/engine... RPG stuff is a great part of the game, level rising, gears, gear upgrading, artefacts, skill points... It reminds me of an Assasin's Creed game. There's not much to say it's good, noob friendly and simple. 3. Story I love it. It's good kinda story, i liked it, and enjoyed it. The only thing that i didn't like is introducing new Avenger Khamala Khan (Miss Marvel) but on the other side of the coin, story is very good and enjoyable. I won't spoil it but i recommend to finish the main story, it remains one BIG cliffhanger. There are a lot of cut scenes, with my free guess about a 45 minutes of cut scenes and so. Really enjoyable story. 4. Conclusion If you have 45+ euros to give for game, I would reccomend you to buy it, but you will need a good computer (a lot better than minimum specs). I had 2 PCs, one was with minimum specs other one was with a recommended specs, game runned very badly on the min spec PC but on the one with  a reccommended, runned very well. The game is great and if you are Marvel fan buy it, you won't regret it. If you wanna play multyplayer fell free to add me.",True,False

"Playway has really done a great job with this one. I enjoyed CMS2014 but they managed to build on that and improve it in almost every way. And all with Kickstarter and a low pledge goal. As the name implies you run an auto shop repair business. But new and improved for 2015 are the cars have many more parts now and the repairs are a good deal more involved. You also earn XP now as you work and complete jobs which can be used to unlock more advanced diagnostic tools like the test path, OBD scanner, compression tester etc and other repair abilities.  There is also an unlockable paint shop now as well so you can do body and paint work and an auction house where you can buy junk cars for parts or fix them up and sell them for profit. Once you earn enough to get the extra parking lot, you can store your cars for service or just collect them. Customers call in on the phone with jobs you can take or decline. An all new better organized parts shop and tablet access eliminates running back and forth to the computer to buy parts. Test driving the vehicle now and using your diagnostic tools generates a parts list condition report for certain systems saving you time poking around and disassembling the vehicle looking for bad parts. All in all there's quite a bit to do and highly recommended if you like puzzle games, working on cars, or are a simulator fan.",True,False

"Spec Ops the Line is truly one of the best games I have played in the last 3 years. I really wish I had played it earlier, although really glad to have just played it at all. I was told it was good and it was, however you should know.  This game is not good because of its gameplay, its good for the story it holds behind the gameplay. The gameplay I feel is supposed to be the way its, now its not bad by any means. Its just in some ways a little repetitive, but really it not that bad.  This game masterfully ties every choice and action you do into the story. While your playing you feel good or not so in the choices you make but no matter what, at the end you will see what this game was trying to show you this whole time and it will show what you have done, for the best....or the worst. Trust me, play this game all the way through and remember that there are more than one ending, but you don't have to play the game over and over you can just play the last chapter and get all the endings.

"This game is more targeting hardcore players rather than casuals. Casual players can still enjoy the game to some degree if they are willing to spend some time to learn how the game works since this game takes realism to a whole different level than most other shooting games. Your PC must also be loaded in order to run the game smoothly. Note that even in high-end pc, there may be some frame drops because this game is not very optimized. Single player is pretty trash considering controlling the bots is almost impossible. When diving to the multiplayer though, you will then feel the true potential of the game.",True,False

"Halcyon 6 is a 4X/Turnbased Strategy/Tactical RPG game with great elements but not delivering a longterm gameplay value. + Graphic design: Pixel art is good but not outstanding. Some parts even uninspiring. + UI: Well set, easy to understand. + Sound design: Even its repetitive, soundtrack is perfect. Goes amazingly well with the gameplay. Sound effects are below par. + Game mechanics: There's a lot going on there and they all connect with each other superbly. + Gameplay: For the first run, everything is new, suprising and addicting. (Second run... Forget about it, you have seen it all.) - Variety on game mechanics. Even it seems like the game deals and offers amount of mechanics to the player, when you inspect the parts on their own, they all crumble. For example; there are ships but variety and customization is very low, there's a tech tree but it is very limited, there are ground battles but every battle feels the same, there are factions but they have little to none impact on the run, there is a map but its the same thing sprinkled over everywhere. - Gets old fast. After the first run, i had no intention or desire to go back for a second. Actually, i did start a second run to see if theres a new element or a rogue-like mechanic is preset... and there is not. Quitted fast.  Halcyon 6 is not a bad game, its even very fun for the first run but it doesnt have the longevity you would expect from its genre. If one run is enough for you (probably 5 to 6 hours) go for it, if its not wait for a sale.",True,False

"This is truly a fun game to play I also enjoy a game that offers collectibles, which you get plenty to find here. There were ""Morphing"" items to collect which weren't always very easy to find as some of them blended into the background very well! You also had ""Memory"" items to collect, which again weren't always easy to spot. Fortunately, the jump map has icons for each of them so you know if there are any in the area you are at, and the strategy guide itself also had a section that showed the location of each collectible in each scene. The music in the games was so peaceful...it truly was beautiful to listen to. There is also a journal that has a section for the current objective and also gives you more of the back story. I honestly don't usually pay too much attention to the stories in the games, but that wasn't the case with this game. I honestly was interested in the story and did read the journal pages. The graphics in the game were amazing! They were very well done and then when I started to play the bonus game, they were absolutely stunning!",True,False

"Well, this is a take from someone who doesn't shy away from old games, even though I was still a little brat when this game came out. After investing 100 hours into the game, I can finally say that I'm ready to highlight some pros and cons. Pros: Cons: Overall, this game is a relic of the past even in its Enhanced rendition. I've played a fair share of the late 80s and early 90s games (Wizardry, M&M, Gold Box, and SSI games) so putting up with bad UI and other problems doesn't bother me too much, I can still enjoy the old-school experience, and that's why I won't leave a negative review. Would I ever consider recommending this game to my peers or friends? Definitely not. Honestly speaking, you can skip this one and go straight to Baldur's Gate II.

"One of the key features in ArcheAge Unchained is the housing system. While it’s not crucial to have a house, it is of utmost importance for the development of your character and the trading aspect. The land claim was unlocked a few days after launch, but the major guilds wasted no time and claimed most spots of land left and right. It’s just a wild guess, but finding an unclaimed spot of land to build your farm right now is probably a daunting prospect, if not an impossible task. This is an aspect that can make or break the game for any player willing to invest his time and effort, but coming up with a rational response capable of pleasing everyone in this area is a rough challenge. The housing predicaments lead us into a piercing conclusion that is both suited for Unchained and Legacy: ArcheAge isn’t a PvE-friendly game. If you like to take your time to explore the land, complete quests, and generally have fun exploring, you’re in for some punishment and frequent ganking at the hands of merciless guilds and ruthless high-level players. ArcheAge has an interesting territory system where factions fight for dominance, creating a flow that keeps the world in permanent change, with peace periods and callous periods of war. Joining a guild will get you the priceless support that you need to traverse certain areas unscathed; doing it alone will often punish you with death and no hope whatsoever of reaching your destination. Until level 30, your adventure goes smoothly, and you grow in many ways during several hours. You raise a trustworthy mount and get a wolf pup to aid you in combat. Unlocking active and passive skills and experimenting with the different skillsets is a rewarding experience, as you discover effective combos and how to approach the mobs in different ways. But suddenly, you become an enticing target for every bloodthirsty player, as PvP shows its dominant face, telling you to shape up or ship out. ArcheAge has such a complex trade system where guilds play a vital role, that this is a dream come true for anyone who loves PvP and can put in the energy and hours that this requires. As a player that favors PvE, I struggled to find my footing, but I can appreciate the potential in ArcheAge Unchained. The disadvantage is that the sandbox aspect is downplayed in favor of a massive grind that subverts the game’s good intentions. Other tasks and missions become trivial in the face of greater rewards provided by the daily quests and the ArchePass system, which hopefully will return in better shape and absolutely exploit-proof. This is a game for PvP, for guilds to battle over territory supremacy. How can you rate for innovation a relaunch of a game originally released in the west in 2013? It’s very simple: you compare it with the current state of MMOs and what the competition has to offer. Open world sandbox MMORPGs are a dying breed, with very few rivals worthy of the label. Besides Black Desert Online, it’s hard to find other similar-themed games that are genuine sandboxes where you are free to do as you please. Significant touches such as the trial system contribute to a game that may look like many others, but has some clever features fueling its core experience. That is why ArcheAge still feels like a fresh experience after all these years.  ArcheAge Unchained is a pure MMO, with many players combining forces for a common goal, which is pretty much destroying the opposing guilds. Its main draw is the competitive faction PvP and it shines in that regard. Aion does a similar thing within its world but without any sort of sandbox wrappings. Strutting across this world on your own is useless and against nature. ArcheAge is a hardcore MMORPG where there is no place for lone wolves or ill-informed players – they will be nothing more than easy prey for the large hunting parties. Black Desert Online is a much solo-friendly MMO in case you are looking for something like that.  The launch of ArcheAge Unchained coincided with the new Shadows Revealed update, which arrived on the Legacy servers as well. This brought a host of graphical upgrades to some locations, better combat effects, houses went through a visual redesign, and the Elf class was revamped, among other things, significantly improving these aspects… in theory. Technically, most changes aren’t easy to spot, but that is probably a concealed compliment. While Black Desert Online is on its own league visually speaking and Final Fantasy 14 is giving chase, ArcheAge remains a solid and pleasant-looking game. The classes are detailed and diverse, and the environments are expansive but could do with added points of interest. The major cities are vast and enthralling, although most of the interiors are empty geometrical spaces that could do with some serious decoration to make them feel livelier. The soundtrack tries to strike a balance between frantic war tunes and soothing melodies, and it’s the latter that deserves the most praise. As for the sound effects, what stands out is the heavy clank that hits hard every time you deliver a quest – this is the one that occasionally comes to me in my sleep, for no reason whatsoever.  A couple of weeks after launch, there is so much going on behind the scenes that it’s hard to accurately say if ArcheAge Unchained is worth the asking price. There have been obvious improvements and changes in the right direction, but there are a few hindrances dragging the experience down and preventing it from getting a heartfelt endorsement. The vision is clearly there and a noticeable care for the future of the game is irrefutable; there is no subscription to worry about, the balance-breaking items seem to be gone, and the labor system isn’t the problem that it was (or is) in the Legacy servers. However, some things like the ArchePass need fixing before the experience can be deemed safe enough. You’ll get your money’s worth right now if you like your in-depth PvP gameplay, but the best is – hopefully – yet to come.    Gamigo managed to fix a few things for ArcheAge Unchained but broke a few others in the process. The troubled launch didn’t do it any favors, with exasperating queues, but the added drama of the ArchePass exploit was something that could and should have been entirely avoided. Without these worrisome missteps, ArcheAge Unchained could have been the game that fans of in-depth open world PvP sandbox MMORPGs were waiting for. There is sizable value to ArcheAge, and the undeniably appealing and complex systems are almost one of a kind – it’s hard to find anything quite like it. For all its cliched fetch and kill quests, there is a wealthy dose of originality and underlying quality that remains almost unrivalled. ArcheAge Unchained is a strangely niche game that seems to have a widespread appeal, as bizarre as that may sound. Now all that it needs is some urgent bug-squashing and an enduring commitment from the developers to finally achieve the definite version of their unique MMORPG. One-of-a-kind open world sandbox MMORPG Labor system substantially improved New Swiftblade skillset Impressive PvP battles Ingenious trial system Flawed and exploit-prone ArchePass Land rush is once again troublesome Not PvE friendly",True,False

"It's a pretty good puzzle-y rogue-like where you pick strategic bonuses to build your character defensively and offensively and need to carefully plan your next step around the placement and damage capabilities of each type of enemy on the field. I think it's fun and makes you think, and is great for shorter sittings. I would recommend it at the asking price! That said, I've played like a billion rounds of Hoplite, the Android game this is inspired by, and I do prefer that over this. Hoplite is really hard, and often frustrating, which this is not. I think that's not a bad thing, but neither do I feel like it's really an improvement over the original. This game adds some more offensive skills (more ranged options, most significantly) and you can pick from the full list of special bonuses at the successful completion of every level instead of a random, limited list of choices like in Hoplite. That's nice because your build isn't as subject to RNG, but it makes the game feel less difficult (so the ""puzzle""/""strategy"" aspect is a little less satisfying), and some of the bonuses are clearly overpowered and more useful than others. I think the graphics here don't look very polished; I greatly prefer Hoplite's pixel graphics. I would also like to be able to turn off the persistent blood spatter. It's a super tiny game (only 67 MB!), but feels ever so slightly sluggish on my 5-year-old laptop. That actually turned me off the game a bit, but I tried it on my desktop before writing this review and the movement feels acceptably crisp and smooth. There are a few things I actually don't like about this game. One is the inability to make the window a) smaller and b) portrait instead of landscape. As a game inspired by a mobile game and that uses simple graphics, it doesn't need to be such a big window. I'd love to play this while watching a movie on the other half of the screen. The second is that 23 levels is too long for one ""round"". There are too many same-y early levels with the first two types of monster before a third one starts appearing. You get good at killing them/avoiding damage after you survive a few levels and pick up a couple bonuses. The third is that you're punished for not killing everything on the level, which doesn't make sense since your end goal is just to get to the bottom and kill the boss. You shouldn't lose XP for finding a way to escape without wasting time killing everything.",True,False

"Considering I've always been a dedicated naruto fan and considering it as a memento that's a part of my childhood. I bought the bundle pack, so as for Storm 4, in particular. I would say in terms of its grandeur of battling I'm just left for words, speechless as that being the suiting descriptor it's just on a whole different grand scale. An echelon of high tier badassery if you ask me. The action and battle scenes are the best I've seen out of this game comparing it to the previous storm titles. Now in terms of narration and storyline (adventuring), it may be formatted differently, and brief, the antithesis sort of to the previous storm titles but, I still sobbed and yet couldn't have been more attached to it. And that's not to say the inclusion being that we also have the dlcs (Boruto expansion and the Ostusuki characters, Momo and Kin) (Adult Sasuke is badass naruto too). I know I'm pretty late on this and also I've finished the series too a while ago but, this is an all-out amazing game but, of course, long it has been obsolete considering not that many players are playing it since the game is kind of old. But regardless I recommend it!",True,False

"Just as fun when I played it back on 360. Great graphics, nice music and the voiceover is well done and pleasant. Some of the platforms can be a little tricky to navigate due to the 2.5d nature of the game but it's not a huge deal. Overall it's a lot of fun if you enjoy platformers. Shame the original Genesis version isn't included though but that's ok.",True,False
"The first Evil Within was, when all is said and done, a mish-mash of just about every ""survival horror"" cliche under the sun. The game had no compunctions, whatsoever, about proudly flying the influence of every major horror game released since the early Resident Evils and Silent Hills...all the way up to the latest-and-greatest released in the twenty-odd years since, such as Outlast and The Last of Us. It got away with such brazen plagiarism for one reason and one reason alone: it was good. Real good. Probably as good as the best games which helped spawn it, and better than all the rest. Anyone who enjoyed that first instalment should be pleased to hear that not that much has changed for the sophomore outing. I mean, sure, no one should be surprised to hear that everything's a wee bit ""bigger"" this time around. More action, more gore, more stealth, more weapons, more crafting, more ""open world""-ish elements, and two - count 'em, TWO - different types of safe/save rooms. We all expected this. The good news is that they haven't gone ape♥♥♥♥♥♥with any of it, and the basic charms of the original game remain intact. It's much the same thing, with just a few more mechanics and options, and an ever-so-slightly darker (and, arguably, superior) storyline.  Heck, I was happy. Extremely happy. As I'm sure most fans of the first will be. Clearly one of the best horror games of the year, in a very, VERY good year for such things.",True,False

"I've really loved Destiny since the first game came out and I do still love the series. Since the move to Steam I've found the game to still be enjoyable but with constant crashing on the friends & chat app from steam it's exhausting to try to play with friends. Aside from this, like the original, the game still has it's problems. At the time of writing this review we are witnessing the final days of The Guardian Games. Bungie has shown with this event that they are not even really sure how to properly balance the game so everyone can have fun by nerfing Hunters way more than they should've and literally giving Titans the upper hand during the whole event. There are broken bounties in which you have to do what it says hundreds of times before it actually registers and the whole event being based around bounties is kind of dissapointing. Season 10 is the first season where I've really sat down to play this game and aside from lore and other bits it's been partially boring. I feel like the game can really only be enjoyed if you have a fireteam to run activities with and all the DLC's bought. Another problem that this game legitimately has is the ""skill based matchmaking"". Half the time I feel like my whole team is braindead while the other team is a full clan that's been playing the game since it came out and it ruins the fun aspects of PvP. Aside form all of that I'd still recommend the game. Every game has its flaws and this game sure has a lot of them but it's still playable and very fun even if you're playing alone",True,False

"It's great platformer with environment riddles and a lot of emotions. Not only chases but also with very vivid death scenes. Sounds here are just terrifying, It's a mix of horror and mystery but it's always a mystery pulling you through, it's hard not to sink into this game. It's a very enjoyable experience, gimmick with regenration is something I haven't seen often. And SWERY65 made sure to not use it to much unless you like screams of agony. This title is good at showing you pain. Beat me up, but most of his games are very detailed in unexpected stuff if you ever seen Deadly Premonitions or D4, you will know his ropes around characters and world creations. And he is very wild with his works and imagination. It's also visible here. His works are very distinguishing. Plenty of ideas were implemented to keep the gimmick and story interesting including phone calls and SMS, even if some sections were a bit annoying with checkpoints / riddles. Repeating some sections was not fun... but (!!!) going in deeper the ending was worth it. I really liked this interpretation and closure. Very good mood, and I think many people may see a lot more with J.J. Macfield. Heartly recommending this. For artistic value? It's very well done even if a little short.",True,False

It's a very emotional game with a fantastic narrative, exceptional music and a very touching and sentimental at the same time history. Regarding the gameplay is quite simple. It reminds me of the games of the year’s 90. Establishes such a deep connection between the game and the player who will make you feel many sensations and emotions, and perhaps even eyes moisten. At the same time it has some touches of humor. Well, I will not give more details, simply if you want to experience a different feeling and above all very human need to play. Pure love story.

You can try solo if you really love the game(cause it will be hard, you will eventually learn to play better in solo) I have lost hours of work to someone cause of my poor aim or I got greedy to loot.

"(Full review follows below) 	  is a very soulful game. That’s probably its most defining feature.  It's in the style of an isometric hack-and-slash, drawing from arcade roots and presented with a poignant atmosphere.  It is definitely a very easy game to enjoy; and it should appeal to wide variety of gamers.  And since it is medium length and has a wide range of difficulty options, it is a good game for anyone who may want to take a step out of their comfort zone and try something different. Probably the first thing that jumps out about   is the gorgeous, hand-painted artwork. But that only scratches the surface.  The whole atmosphere of this game is incredible.  The world literally unfolds around you as you make your way through the environments. The soundscape is spot on and the music is great. It is a very aesthetic experience. The gameplay is strongly narrative-based.  In fact, there is an actual narrator that guides you through the game.  This nature of the game does lead it to be semi-linear, although you do have a fair amount of branching options to work with in some aspects of the game. The gameplay is pretty simple and intuitive, but also offers a surprising amount of depth.  There is a decent variety to your arsenal and to the enemies you face.  And the baseline difficulty is very easy, which is the proper way to design games so that everyone can enjoy them.  Nevertheless, the innovative difficulty system in the game allows you to tweak various specific options (enemy health, enemy damage, player movement, etc.) to meet your preference and tackle the most extreme challenges/achievements. Now the game isn’t really that long if you were to only do a single playthrough of the campaign. However, there are the aforementioned challenges and achievements to tackle, a  , and also an   where you get a running score throughout your playthrough and can compete on leaderboards, if that is your thing.  So you should be able to get a good amount of playtime. So, in summary, I would say that the synergy of the soulful presentation, the intuitive gameplay, and the unique narration makes this game more charming than a Disney prince.    is a great gaming experience, and a modern classic.  Unless you are adamantly not interested in this genre, I recommend you at least consider giving it a shot.",True,False

"I can surely say that this is, by far, my favorite platformer game ever. It is so well made and it's pretty challenging but you can go through stages with many different caracters, although i use the normal one due to speed to be able to get A+ grade on every level. If you ask me it is the money well spent! This game is special because any game can be really hard, but Super Meat Boy has such tight controls that any fumble is your own doing. When you die you know you died because you made a mistake, not because the game is stupid. This is what allows you to come back and keep trying these impossible levels without raging, so when you eventually beat them the sense of accomplishment is immense.",True,False

"Rocket League is an e-sport in the truest sense of the word. It's a game with a small set of mechanics and rules, which must be mastered and integrated into a real-time strategy without relying on power-ups, upgrades, crates, and other video-gamey stuff. The skill curve of this game has so far been shown to be infinite, judging by the ever-evolving playstyles of professional Rocket League players in a game whose mechanics have never been significantly altered. Rocket League's strengths have never been anything except for the online multiplayer itself. Don't buy this expecting any sort of coherent singleplayer experience.

"My experience with 5 Minutes Rage was not really big because I was able to play only tutorial, so far at my gaming time hours I was unable to find a match. However, even tutorial left me with much to look for from the game. First of all let me start with atmosphere of game. It's almost like Far Cry Blood Dragon(cyberpunk 80's or smth). The soundtrack with drum makes battles even with A.I. pretty epic. The gameplay is based on handball kind of game, with deathmatch build in. U catch the ball, u throw the ball, while trying to survive or eliminate all who will try to destroy you. I tried only 1 vs 1, so can't say for other modes. What I did like is the various abilities, for example u can use shields, shoot or supercharge ur laser cannon and perform a 1 hit k.o. to ur enemy. Video, sound is superb for this kind of 2d game and sport theme with destroy or be destroyed kind of gameplay is a good approach to 2d world.

"Where do I start. At a young age I was addicted to the first game. I would play it for hours on end finishing the game with each unique character and mastering their specific play style. This game to me was ""Icing on cake"".  When it comes to harsh survival situations, resource management and fast paced hand-to-hand combat, this game ticks all boxes.  This game also involves personal strategies when it comes to kill Zombies/mutations: Do I attack the group of mobs head on? Or attack them from a distant with explosives and firearms. The storyline is interesting to say the least, when it comes to crazed tribe men to rich military bastards, you can't help but have an envy to kill them and get off the god forsaken island.  I would highly recommend this game to anyone that can swallow high levels of gore and get entertained as much as I do from heads and body parts flying and staining a beautiful but deadly beach.

"Note: The review is spoiler-free, written based on keyboard and singleplayer gameplay. Table below for quick check, scroll down further for detailed pros and cons. :) Whoa ho ho! Cuphead.. I picked up this game the moment when I heard that it feels just like the classic Contra run-n-gun shooting. But in perfect 1930's Disney cartoon style!! Where else can you ever find another like this?!  So here I go, became cuphead boy dressed in red (or mugman in blue if you play local co-op with your partner), shooting magical droplets out of my bare fingertip, bashing in an ""Alice in Wonderland"" style cruel little damned island. I used to stay up all night beating Contra with my dad when I just started primary school, this game for what it is, went immediately into my collection.  Where should I even start?! For a game developing team that's made of 3 people, after 3 years of development, they've really made sure that almost every aspect of the game, for its own genre, is done  .  Here's something I almost forgot to mention: For every game section in Cuphead, there are   difficulty settings for you to choose from:   and  . By default, the game will always run on the Regular difficulty unless you select Simple otherwise. Simple mode excludes your ability to fight certain bosses whom you can access in Regular mode. So it's completely up to the player which difficulty they want to beat the game on..  For such quality of art design, character design and battle design, if you enjoy dying your way to perfection, this game is for you. You're prolly gonna die a lot, but if you don't mind such means to achieve faster reflex and having sense of great achievement in having perfect runs (even with your partner!), then go grab this game NOW.",True,False

"This game is AMAZING!!!!!!! But the community is trash. If you want to play the story, you'll have a great time. Getting on online is a different story. People will go out of thier way just to mess with you, and when you call them out on it they just say your being ""salty"". Don't get me wrong though, its an awesome game.  Did I mention the modders? Oh these guys are the best. They do things like Fly, be invisible, spawn objects. But even better, they can give you in game money, that can get your account banned. Rockstar did an awesome job making an entire gaming community into huge a$$holes. No one cares about helping each other out, its just shoot and get angry that people shoot you back. All in all I would love this game if the people who played it took two seconds to think. Maybe that guy spent a lot of time getting those supplies, I should leave him to his buisness.

"This game is really a love letter. Many people may think of a romance reading this sentence but I don't mean to say it in that way, or maybe I do, who cares. What's this and why does it look so strange? Why would a buy a game about a sloth with Trump's hair and a guy with big tumours in his head? That's what I've come to answer! First of all I want to start talking about why I said this game is a love letter. Many of you, grew up with the point and click adventure games (most of this people can't count their age with their fingers of the hands and feet together), and well, there goes the love letter part of this game. You can find tributes to some of the most popular games of this style like Day of the Tentacle, Grim Fandango, and even the Neverhood! As those games playstyle, this point & clicker emulates them. You can Use, Talk to or Pick Up all the things you have at your disposal, or at least try to :) . You have your inventory where you can try to do your must stupid item mixes your mind asks you to do, and you can not advance until the ♥♥♥♥♥ ass puzzle is solved (except the last one, which has a #### stupid method to skip it, lol). We're running late and have to answer the last question, why is it worth it to buy a so strange looking game with this weird characters telling me I will feel awkward playing this? That's an easy question to answer! As another effect from the blast from the past you can feel, this game has awesome humour that will make your burst out laughing at how stupidly it is sometimes, all the characters have a high degree of charm that will make you miss them when you finish. Aside from that, you have a superb voice acting very well done that gives some cool aesthetic to this hilarious characters that gives them the right touch of flavour to make this an even greater game. Even if it's based on some of this oldschool adventure games, you will see that this game is not as long as those, and you can finish it in less than 10 hours, which can be different depending on you capacity to solve puzzles. If there's a part that you don't know what to do, or you have returned to play from a few weeks of hard work you can just go and that's your tumor (that's why people have one, right? Really, you can do that!) even though the game is very easy and simple in the puzzle section, Hope you enjoy the game, and as cheap as it is, I don't think it wouldn't be worth it!",True,False

"8/10 Get it you dirty zombie lover you. Background: The game is a single player FPS/base simulation/light RPG. There are some novelty ideas here. Characters progress based on the play style. You don't have direct control over what skills to upgrade. Action portion is a pretty standard affair. Zombie smashing feels satisfying. NPC behave in a way that you would expect. They are actually very helpful. Base management system is robust with plenty options; yet, it's not overly complicated. Survivors interact in very basic ways. Supply runs take a lot of time and effort. Completing missions becomes secondary to building up your base. Missions are varied and interesting. The story is decent. It doesn't feel too restricting.  Graphics: graphics are decent, but won't wow anyone.  Sound: the atmosphere is creepy, and sounds play big role in that.",True,False

"Dadcal's 4 is the solution to all of life's problems. All jokes aside, I think the game has one of the most welcoming community. Granted, players doing raids aren't always very nice (as well as people on region chat), but other than that--in my experience--the community is overall very giving and helping (especially the veteran players). I've been given numerous items from MR 20-26 players--weapons, rare mods, a complete set of a Nova Prime--for free). Most of them also wouldn't mind helping you on missions you find difficult, if you'd just ask. Almost to the point where they're eager, really. There was a time where I kept failing this one assassination mission, then a vet joined in, stomped the boss and asked how long I have been playing. Told him I was new, guy then played with me for a while, told me what things I should look for first and where to farm them, etc. I asked very basic questions, but he answered all of them. If I'm being honest, nothing like these ever happened with me in any game in my life. Whatever these developers did was magic.",True,False

"This may not be the best game ever. But there are a couple of positive things to say about it. >The overall style was very retro kinda like Sega CD which was nice. >The characters you could play as all had different movesets and combos. >The story and the dialogue will make you smile and even giggle now and then. >There are 3 kinds stages which were beat em up's, Arcade shooter and sidescroller driving stages. This is also one of the few games where the developer himself has commented on my screenshots to offer advice on how to fix certain problems.  The only kinda like bad thing would be that the game is rather short in general but there will be a Episode 2 in the future. Some of the menu music tunes sounds like short loops which only is a bother if you are in the menu tho. Also I since I get alot of questions around playing games like this. I have a girlfriend and she is okay with with me playing  games like this.",True,False

"The story is marvelous the fact that you can choose the ending of the playthrough is another bonus. Graphics are definitely a work of art, it's incredible. Just like in The Witcher 2, at that time no game could get near the level of detail like it had. I still haven't finished the DLCs because I don't want to end this beautiful franchise.  Game has decent RPG elements not too complicated. You can easily get connected in this universe because every character in it feels alive. Which that leads to immersion, if you're into roleplaying and some realistic stuff this game is great at it. Also side quests are not some repetitive boring fetch quests that makes you feel like you're grinding, they have pretty good storylines just like the main story.  The world is huge so there's lots of things to discover to make you feel immersed in the world. With the ultra graphics your mind will be blown away, it's a work of art. Witcher Contracts are pretty good it has the feeling of that you're really like an hunter that does research and gets prepared for the hunt but some do get repetitive. This game has background music like nothing else it gives me the chills every time. So the conclusion is pretty much this game is a must have game in your library there's always something to spend your time in. And I think it's the game of the decade, CD Projekt Red really does know what they're doing.",True,False
"Planet Coaster is a truly outstanding game that provides both a visually impressive and rewarding experience for the player. Although, there are few issues that I have with the game, as a creative type this game is exactly what I had been looking for within the tycoon genre.  - 100% modular building system.  - Hundreds of building pieces and scenery items. - Blueprints and Steam Workshop support.  - Advanced movement tools; very handy for design.  - Basic micromanagement for staff and shops.  - Ability to choose where entertainers or staff members patrol e.g. janitors looking for rubbish.  - Intuitive coaster construction and ride customisation.  - Challenge, Career, and Sandbox modes.  - Stunning graphics and artstyle.  - Calming and unique musical score.  - Amazing sound design.  - Framerate gradually starts to fall over time due to prop detail.  - Management aspects of the game is considered quite basic by some players, however this can be looked past if you are not looking for an in-depth management experience.  - A lot of the management parts of the game are hidden away in menus that can be confusing for first time players.  Planet Coaster is a game that you can spend hours with without even unpausing the game, just to get all those tiny details ready before the guests experience your wonderland (or hell!). As a buyer of the Thrillseeker Edition, I am more than happy with my purchase!",True,False

"Highly recommended, one of the best-executed remakes there's ever been. I didn't play the originals, but it's clear there was an incredible amount of work put into modernizing the games and even improving them. I'm definitely a Spyro fan after playing this and I hope they port more games over to Steam. I'd only played one Spyro game before, Enter the Dragonfly on PS2. That was long ago, so I don't remember much of it. It was very interesting to see how the games evolved through the trilogy. He REMEMBERS all his abilities from the second game to the third game. Spyro has a lot of lines in the first game, usually some (not so) witty retort to everything; that was majorly tuned down for the next two games, which could be good or bad. The flying courses are a lot less troublesome in the third game, which also greatly reduced the amount of time to get through the story of each world. The second game is unique with pre-rendered scenes before and after each world, but it gets annoying that you have to go through everything again each time you revisit each world. Thankfully, all scenes are skippable. Also, the second game improved almost everything I didn't like about the first, especially the ability to ""hover"" at the end of a glide. Graphics are fantastic. Gameplay, well, I love collecting things and getting all those 100%s. The platforming and everything is very smooth for the most part. The games do start out very easy, but the difficulty increases nicely as they progress. There are also plenty of extra challenges to take on. It's also cool that they mix in different genres, especially with the sub-worlds in the third game, so the gameplay is more varied. I'm not sure if the Sparx challenges in the third game unlock as soon as you leave the world; I didn't do them until the end, so the upgrades they gave didn't get a chance to be very useful. Would recommend doing those as they become available. Also, make use of the nifty ""point to treasure"" feature that was added. Very helpful for cleaning up the last few gems, which can be hard to find. There's a lot more to say, I really skimmed over reviewing the gameplay. But I would recommend experiencing it for yourself if you have even a mild interest. Having a whole trilogy of games is a great value.",True,False

"Depending on the path chosen, this game can be incredibly lighthearted, or incredibly...bleak. In the pacifist route the game is fairly cheerful, and the player earns the trust and respect of everyone they meet, and relying on these friendships is shown as a strength. The game praises players for pursuing a peaceful path. The genocide route is not something that can be done by ""accident"" much like it is hardly an ""accident"" to be a pacifist. You must hunt down and kill off each and every single monster in the underground. The background music changes, and the characters react with fear to you, and warn you to stop your actions many times. It quickly turns pretty creepy, but there's nothing inappropriate about it. The only ""accidental"" path is the Neutral path which happens by not meeting requirements for Pacifist or Genocide. Something else to notice while playing this game is that it leans heavily on players assuming things based on common video game tropes. For instance, if you screw up and restart quickly a character may call you out for restarting. In a second play through there are definitely characters who will say you look ""familiar"" at times, as if this has all happened before. All in all this is a wonderful game, and my only real complaint is that I wish there was more to love! It may still be a bit early to declare this an ""instant classic"" but I hope it sticks around for gamers to cherish and remember for years to come. For kids and adults, I think there's something we can all learn about ourselves from this simple indie title that the internet won't shut up about lately..",True,False

"When I saw that this game was avaible to buy again, I was over the moon. And yes, if you are a fan of the series, it's worth the money. As we know with other Telltale games, the choises doesn't really matter, for the most part. The story takes us on the same road, whatever your choises are. With minor details, of course. Hate it or love it, it's the same deal in this one. And speaking of the story, there will always be people who love it or hate it. And there will always be things that you can nitpick on or things that maybe aren't really that logical from a real point of view. So, those people who point that out in the forums are right. But, I personally wasn't really bothered by that so much. It isn't anything new. There's always been things which aren't logical or how they dealt with different characters. Some I didn't care about and there been others which made me angry for wasting a good character etc.  I personally have overlooked those things because even tho there has been some shady and hasty decisions in the story or to a character, like Kenny, for example, I always have enjoyed the ride while playing the Walking Dead and it has given us some amazing characters and stories for which I really feel strongly about. It's crazy how you can love imaginary characters/people, right? As I said, you can nitpick the story or why the devs did some things but in the end, I think they really made an amazing ending to this series which is up there with S1 and 2. S1 is still my fav, tho.  Otherwise, visually the game looks absolutley fantastic. The characters, the environment, the lightning is fantastic. Music is great too. It does a great job setting the mood. But I didn't expect anything less. The camera angle is a but weird tho. It took a little while to get used to. In conclusion, if you liked the first two seasons, then you most likely will like this one too and you will get a ending to this amazing character that we have come to love over the past couple of years. Storywise you will have to be the judge if you like it or not, the ""choises matter""- thing hasn't really changed so if that has bothered you, it still will. If not, then great!  But whatevere you think of the dev's decisions about the story I think it is worth your money because at the end of the day, it's a good conclusion to an amazing story & game! Thank you Skybound for finishing it!",True,False

"Screencheat is a crazy game about looking at the other players' screens to see where they are, and then proceeding to run them over with a toy horse, shoot them through a wall, blow them up with a teddy bear, or whack them to death with a fish. As you can tell from the name, the videos and the screenshots, the game is splitscreen, and everyone is invisible. You have to locate the other players by screencheating, and then go and kill them. Every kill is satisfying. A ragdoll flops into existence when someone dies, and the ragdoll models include fish-people and chickens. There is an announcer, whose accent can be changed in the options. My personal favourite is the Australian announcer :D There are 10 maps, which are well designed and colour-coded so that you can easily tell which area someone is in. There are 10 weapons, which are all unique. There are several different gamemodes, such as CTF (Capture the Fun), Deathmatch, KOTH, Murder Mystery (you are assigned a target that you must kill to gain points), and Juggernaut, to name a few. The gamemodes can be played FFA or in teams. There are also several server mutators which can be activated to create an even more hilarious/weird experience, like huge ragdolls, and Australian mode. The game supports up to 8 players on a server. 4 players is a nice number, but a full server of 8 is pure insanity, and it's wonderful. You can play local or online multiplayer, or both at once. You gain exp by playing, and as you level up you unlock bonus ragdolls (such as a hotdog) and weapon skins (such as the Cod of Duty skin for the melee weapon). Overall it's a really fun game, and it's even more fun if you have friends to play with. It would probably be a great party game. There are so many funny moments, but it can be quite competitive too, and it gets pretty intense sometimes. But it's always fun! The game needs more people playing it, so buy it sometime!",True,False

The melee fight might not be AAA-quality but it's sufficient and I hope they improve it further but the immersion and feeling are great! It's a game that chills you out and offer some really tense moments at the same time. You get attached to your camp(s). You can grow your tribe and you can see their improvement.

"""XBlaze! Activate!"" (Updated Review as of 7/6/16) If you ever thought to find your normal everyday life wasn't normal, then you've come to the right place, we start out our story of the Azure/Blue/etc. with Touya Kagari, a normal High School student with his pals Hinata and Akira, but when Touya comes to a place of remembrance, he meets a mysterious girl by the name of Es, and the two start their journeys together. As it is, XBlaze is the prequel story to the popular fighting game series ""BlazBlue"", the lore you'll seek from BlazBlue will also be mentioned here as well, including some characters within similar familiar names and other viable info. Originally available on the PS3/PSV, the Steam release is more or less the same as it is, with a few PC options to tweak to your style, along with the option to have the subtitles either in full English or Japanese. The game is pure Visual Novel, so the game relies on its own system called the ""Toi"" (which also has Character Bios), using it wisely will decide your fate, from getting the good, bad, or even the gag endings. Using ""Tips"" will let you know on info of the XBlaze world, though some of it will differ depending on which character route you're planning to clear. Either way, the port is great, and it loads scenes and such faster than the console version (also, bonus extras if you happen to clear all routes in the game), but yes, as usual with majority PC players, there will be problems with people trying to run it, it happens to some, but not all, but it happens. That's what there's the forums/discussions are they for people to check out the issues and for users that can help out on it if at all possible. As of 3/3/16, a 9.1MB Patch/Update/Etc. has fixed some of the game's issues as I've originally mentioned before, that being the A.O.S. crash, the half and half localization errors, and probably crashes when trying to continue certain chapters/routes. There still might be some bugs in there, but will be known whenever necessary. As of 7/6/16, Aksys Games announced at Anime Expo that XBlaze Lost: Memories will now get its steam port, so yeah! \^^/",True,False

"Definatelly one of the best Campaign i have played from games that are released in 2015 , non-stop action , never knows what happens next , so much abilities to use on your soldier , so much nice weapons and customisation during the Campaign , it was not easy like on some previous titles of COD where you on Hard walk like Chuck Norris trought the game and finish a Campaign with no dead. I fully enjoyed this Campaign and i apsolutely don't care about so much negative and joke  Review's for this games , for me , it made it well and i signature it for me for the Best Campaign of 2015 , alone the SP - Campaign  is playable by max 4 Player's as an Co-Op Campaign. Rush and Gun , like all cod tittles but this time a bit modern style  in the BO3 , mostly enjoable , not even a second bored for the short time i have played it , and i think i will spend a lot time on this tittle. Cooming soon ( Im not really rush into this mod because of the cheat population ) On my first turn , i joined Graphic setting in options and nothiced that the games was settup on maxed out , i turend v-synv on and i run it on a GTX 970 FTW+ with 16GB 1600hz ram on a AMD Phenom II X6 CPU 3,2GHz. Recording a gameplay with shadow play on full HD and high quality settings ,  and i was getting constant 60 FPS ( my monitor is 60 hz and i using v-sync ON ) = This is a Huge + So far 9/10 from me.. and i highly recommended it if you are open for something new , even if it's called Call of Duty ...",True,False

"This game was overwhelmingly postitive before telltale shut down and everyone review bombed it. Since then several companies have stepped foward to take it over and finish it, so it probably won't even be cancelled. Regardless, it's an awesome game so far, on par with the first two seasons. In my book it's worth the money even if only for the first two episodes just to play as Clementine one last time. Please stop with the negative reviews, it's not going to change anything.

"i perfer this game over overwatch becuase you can do many more thing to get the advantage over your oppenent than just changing your hero. before you enter a game you can go over to your champion of choice and make them a loadout which will greatly determine the way you play that champion and is an important part of the game. when making a loadout you can do things like redusing the cooldown of certain abilites or doing damage to sheilds or gaining more health and etc... when you enter a game you can choose talents wich can be unlocked by leveling up your champion. each champion has uniqe talents and further more determine your playstyle while puting you at a disadvantage or advantage against your enemy. when you choose a talent you can buy items with the credits you earn through killing,damaging,healing or capturing the payload. items are divided in four different categories which i don't remeber their names but they can effect your utility,healing,damage and sheild or armor(it's not exactly sheilds but i'll go with it).  the game is constantly being updated with bug fixes, nerf and buffs and skins and so on. the team is trying their best to make the players happy but sometimes they mess up wich can be forgived sometimes. i hope this post was usefull to you. thanks for reading.",True,False

"Another game in which HiRez tries to milk the market.. That said, is a pretty good variation on the genre with the different classes I find it funny how HiRez keeps going after every genre somewhat big, instead of fixing issues in their current games.. And I'm someone that has played lots of Smite and Paladins.. Having Tribes was awesome, Global Agenda, sure; Smite with a 3D view on MOBA pretty cool.. Paladins just because Hero Shooters were popular, Hand of the Gods because everyone tried to copy HS, and now a Battle Royale They still haven't fixed many issues in Smite nor Paladins; that said, if you don't like Fortnite (for whatever reason) and don't like the aesthetics from PUBG/H1Z1, then try this game, is based on Paladins so is the same graphics and the classes makes it a little bit more challenging; so instead of PUBG/H1Z1 were people camp spots, or Fortnite were you got to destroy the buildings to get to the people, here you just use abilities",True,True

"If you like puzzle games then this one is definitely for you. You have to pull the hooks/nails/whatever in the correct order without them getting stuck.

In the later levels you have three ""lives"" so the game always stays very fair to you - although completing a level perfectly is totally satisfying. It was kinda relaxing but also a lot of fun for the little playtime you actually get (50 minutes for me). But hey, you can't really make a mistake for a price this low. I'd love to see more levels.

"""Assassin's creed"" basically became derogatory words around the 3rd-4th installment with people saying it's another Call of Duty in terms of differences between each installment and I guess Ubisoft was afraid of changing their ways, after all why alter something that already sells well, right? But oh boy, have they outdone themselves with the latest two games (Origins, Odyssey). They finally mostly dropped the real world story parts and focused on telling the Animus - the recollections part, which makes total sense considering no one ever actually cared about the real world narrative, when people think Assassin's Creed, they think Altair's and Ezio's stories, not Desmond's. Talking about characters, I only played Cassandra thus far out of the two character choices, but I gotta say she almost instantly became one of my AC favorites. They somehow managed to comply the SJW/feminist propaganda by making her a strong, self-dependent female individual while she's also very attractive, charismatic and powerful - truly an impressive feat. They also finally realized that unless they keep revealing major story plots throughout the playtime rather than only at the beginning and the end of the game, the playthrough would become repetitive and eventually boring. In Odyssey, one of the main mechanics became available after nearly 20 hours (!) of my game time. Obviously if you rush through, you'll progress way faster, but who doesn't explore and mess around in AC games..? The story itself is pretty good, it's not revolutionary by any means - good old revenge trope, but it's interesting enough to keep you engaged and there're some twists here and there. I'm not anywhere near the end of the game, so I'll refrain from commenting on this topic any further for now. Now the game isn't perfect, some people don't like the presence of an ingame store which lets you purchase ""time savers"" (cheats), but I simply choose to ignore those features - they don't really add anything meaningful to the game and it's easily playable without its usage, even on the hardest difficulty. Talking about difficulty, some fights seem to be really unbalanced - legendary creatures (such as the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pig) force you to fight in a certain way so if you chose to be a full on assassin, you literally have to respec and even then it's tough. So far, the pig fight and the fraction battles were two situations I found really frustrating, other than that everything was doable (on nightmare difficulty). That being said, I'm quite impressed how good the game is thus far. 9.5/10 easily at the point of writing this review.",True,False

"Warning - it will take you several hours before you can have wild fun like they've presented the game in the gameplay trailers At the start, your map has marks of several Arks, those contain new abilities and guns, but after you finish them, they don't show up anymore, you have to progress through the story, without idea when they're gonna show up again and then you have to either randomly look at every Question mark ? location, to see if it's an Ark or not , when I was one mission away from the end of the game, I had still 3 guns missing and for abilities I went through half of the game without most of them, simply because Arks are stupidly hidden in world map clustered with nonsense of ??? icons ...I literally finished the whole game, all NPCs were lvl 15,16,15 as I spent ton of time doing all side missions, I had 32 gun upgrade tokens and 20k feltrite and the nonsense upgrade system made it so that I had only lvl 2 guns, the entire game, on hard difficulty, so most of the tougher enemies felt like bullet sponges ! , this way you can actually use it, unlike the original terrible keybinding. By pressing Shift once, you'll warp into direction of the key that you hold (for example you hold A and press Shift, you warp to left), by holding Shift, you'll see enemies, your car and with later upgrades, chests, Ark chests and PDAs +plethora of weapons, shotguns, pistols, rocket launcher and more +interesting abilities like warping forward, powerful ground slam, little black hole +variety of vehicles to drive and upgrades for your main car, weapons and armor +the Overdrive mode basically allows you one shot kills, great for horde clearing +the gunplay is solid and taking down huge monsters, especially at the start, is a blast -pointless NPCs in cities, that you can talk with and they give you quests, for which they often don't give you anything -story is very straight forward Revenge type, with not many twists, often it felt like a chore -map is littered with icons for millions of things to do and it doesn't feel like you have real impact on the world -the Authority turrets are annoying bullet sponges that don't fit this game, you have to take cover and basically spam assault rifle shots at the blue part, then hide behind metal crate when it fires, do this for literally few minutes... -only your car can be upgraded, no other vehicles can get upgrades -the racing minigames on the track are quite bad, as the cars handle poorly -there's no real payoff for killing the spy drones, just another wasted chance -after you finish the game and credits roll, there's bit of cutscenes where all the major characters tell you how This isn't the end, and how you're needed very much in this world...this is sadly nonsense, there's nothing new once you finish, so no point in playing more",True,False

"Detention is a short horror game with a uniquely good story that leaves an emotional impact. The game has a great 2D art style and plays like a retro horror game from the 90's and an amazing soundtrack that makes the atmosphere so much creepier.  I think Detention's strong suit is it's setting as it is rare to see a game take place in a early 1960s Taiwan era, it really helps players educate themselves more through it's story. I feel that this is really important as it tells the political situation of the Taiwan White Terror era and how horrible it was back then, letting us not forget its brutal history.

Zombidle: REMONSTERED is an indie clicker game. In this clicker game you play as the zombies/monsters burning down and pillaging the villages full of people gaining skulls along the way. You use those skulls as your currency for upgrading your amry of darkness. Every once in a while you also run across a scroll that will randomly appear on the screen. These scrolls give you extra things such as chests that have skill upgrades inside them or you can increase the value of the skulls that drop for a few minutes at a time.

"Ok I am biased on this review considering I am for REAL an actually Ghost sniper or so they call us that... civilians... enemy... haters... the US Government. The game is OK the state of play they use reminds me of Columbia just a different Cartel back than... we were fighting. Overall the missions are ok the timed missions suck unless I have C4 or I am blowing an entire base or compound I should not be given always 2:26 to do the stupid deed. That is funny the stupid timed missions... everything is timed down to the sec yes but I will be home eating a freaking Taco while your body bags are being loaded not waiting for my watch to hit zero trying to move a stupid truck up and down a road a mile whatever in always 2:26 drop this crap its stupid. Thats the only problem with the game I have. The AI is impressive not stupid can flank and even at times hunt you very smartly and if they dont get you especially Unidad soldiers they bring everybody and I mean EVERYBODY! twice I have actually fought Unidad soldiers over 200 in one game and playing solo just the other night easily 300 until yes they hunted and killed me and my squad by air and by ground. it appears the AI does not like the Unidad soldiers killed off it actually gets pissed off because they respawn like roaches,,,you kill 3 6 appear..you kill 6 12 appear and so on the AI gets angry. The stats kinda suck on elite soldiers, they are kinds confusing and hard as hell to understand how and when they raise...My Tactical I understand...My stealth Ok have no idea how you figure that one out because I have cleared major bases and compounds without ever being noticed and after %80 it does not move go figure and precision man ok every round has to be a confirmed kill I quess because that must be bullet to kill ratio but whatever still figuring that one out. KIA should be a stat on your player profile always good to look at a number showing enemy killed its motivating. The game is awesome graphics wise beautiful and crisp... couple hole traps where your dude falls in and you have to restart but minimal. Overall gameplay is super fluid and smooth wonderfull scenes and landscape just awesome in that department. Many complain of the grind and repeativeness but thats in real life as well only thing thats changes is the scenery you kill in Roger that. I give the Game 10/10",True,False
"Serious Sam 3 is everything you've come to expect from the franchise; An arcade, lightning fast, Arena Shooter that doesn't take it self to serious, but, with a twist or two for the better or worse. Just like its predecessors, each level is quite impressive in scale, designed from the ground up with the insane arena battles the franchise is known for in mind and the third game does not disappoint in that regard; On top of that, good old Sam still runs as fast as he did before and the ability to carry and entire arsenal of weapons at once (a total of fifteen) has NOT been taken away. Now, while linear, there are still many secret areas to be uncovered, as well as classic pick ups, ranging from different types of Ammo, Health Packs, Armour to Keys and/or any other kind of random item necessary to progress through the game. Pretty standard stuff, that in a way, feels kindda like a breath of fresh air in this day and age. ...now as far as progression and length goes, the game starts up quite slow for a Sam game, but not in an intrusive way like many modern titles do with their pointless scripted events, cutscenes or the like. Instead, the very first handful of levels are quite open to exploration (though still linear to a certain extent) with some interesting enemy placement, with nothing but a few moments dedicated to the insane Arena Shooting we all know and love; It kinda feels like a ""prologue"" for what's yet to come, but fear not, as we progress through the campaign, the game quickly goes back to its roots, and boy is this a long game!  The Single-Player campaign alone toke me over 20 hours to complete, there are also a couple of extra game modes to increase its length like Survival, Single-Player Co-Op and *Multiplayer (Deahtmatch, Capture the Flag, etc), and let's not forget about the Mods! Though... None of it stopped our friends at Croteam from modernizing their title a little, and trust me, I know that ""modernizing"" is a scary word in this day and age, not many franchises live to tell the story after receiving such treatment. ...but fear not, for the most part, the new addictions are nothing but ""cosmetic"" in a certain way, and I'm glad the game was not designed with the two abilities I'm about to mention in mind. For one, we were givin' the ability to Sprint and Aim down the sights; The first which is absolutely ridiculous in a decent way, if we take in consideration that Sam's default speed was NOT nerfed, and I'll leave the rest to your imagination; Now, such ability might come in handy when backtracking and looking for items, but can be exploited as well, since it gives you the ability to literally outrun any kind of enemy in the game. The former however, will slow you down to a crawl and only hurt you in the long run, in other words, do NOT aim down the sights, it's useless, and boy does that make me happy. For one, Serious Sam 3 lacks a Map, which could come in handy at times, specially for some of those dark underground and/or indoor areas that might require the use of your flash light; Dark areas that while few and far in between, are not particularly fun nor the most appropriate place to face of a horde of enemies... ...and by speaking of enemies, this brings me to two very annoying design choices... First one, has to do with the sheer amount of ""Hit Scan"" enemies the game throws at you, like the Clone Soldiers carrying Shotguns and Assault Rifles to the Hatchling Arachnoids (little Scorpions), they can be a pain, plain and simple, specially since we're talking about a game designed around projectile avoidance, though the worst offender has to be the Technopolip (Heli with tentacles) with its near perfect aim. The second faulty design choice, has to do with the insane amounts of dust/smoke effects that have the bad habit of blocking your view all the time, it's not exactly game breaking and as far as graphics and details go, they do look nice, but it's annoying none the less... To put it simple, Sam 3 is visually repetitive, consisting of Middle-Eastern desert towns, Pyramids and Ruins. That's about it... The game could have definitely benefited from different themes, variety is a nice thing. ...also, just like previews Sam titles, this is the kind of game that's fun to play for short amounts of time, lets say, an hour or two a day, otherwise it might become repetitive in the long run. *Sadly, Multiplayer modes like Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, etc, are almost dead (Co-Op modes in the other hand are not). To put it simple, this game has one of the most indepth graphics options menus there is, and as far as optimization goes, it's hard not to be impressed by how smooth the game runs at any given time having in consideration the scale of each map and the amount of enemies on screen.... ...and graphically speaking, the game looks pretty beautiful overall; Nice shadowing, decent textures and character models (nothing that hadn't been done before and done better though), destructible environments, respectable geometry, reflective surfaces and I could go on! I'd advise pushing Color Saturation all the way up though (or at the very least make sure to set up the Color Scheme to ""Vivid""), otherwise everything will look quite dull.   Serious Sam 3 is a frenetic First-Person Shooter (you may enable a Third-Person view as well by pressing H) that could in a certain be compared to ""Oldschool"" games of old, but NOT exactly in the same vain as Doom or Duke Nukem 3D; Sam games are far, far more simplified in terms of level design and complexity but on steroids as far as the shooting goes. It is a fine game with a few problems here and there, but the speed, insanity, enemy variety, constant switching between weapons (required to adapt or take down certain threats at any given time), the humor, secrets and a proper health system more than make up for it. Therefore, earning a respectable rEvo's rating of an 8.0 out of 10!",True,False

"The game is really fun and hilarious, all of the guns feel great and there's a bunch of different weapons/items, it includes all the standard guns you'd expect, M16, AK, AUG, Mac-10, double barrel shotgun, Winchester, MP7, and a bunch more, and all the standard attachments and grenades, but also a bunch of more wacky over the top stuff e.g. A handcannon, that is literally a cannon you hold in your hand, banana suit Armor, implosion grenades, and so on. You can hold your gun sideways and beatbox. The over the top physics are great. Guns work similar to Pubg, having single fire, full auto and occasionally burst.  Your character has some ragdoll physics so you can do things like jump through small windows, it's pretty satisfying being able to smoothly jump out of a building window into another. There are vehicles, but right now I think there's only one type of car (?), though I'm not sure I've played enough to judge. Players in this game are essentially wacky inflatable tube men, running around feels a little bouncy, but not too much.  The controls responsive and aiming/shooting feel great – and that's coming from a guy with 4k hours in CS.  I think the bounciness of the characters helps to balance gun fights, most guns I've used seem to be hit scan and very accurate, though some guns e.g. the VSS , have bullet travel time – working pretty much the same as the VSS in pubg. The gunplay in this game is actually great. You never really feel cheated and the combat is skill based.  The game uses low poly models, but are aesthetically pleasing and cartoonish. I personally like the art style. To make a more objective comment, the artists did a very good job at sticking to the same low poly cartoon style in all of the assets and it is fitting to the silliness of the game.  1. The servers are currently getting more traffic than they can handle – the game got more popularity than the devs expected. Played a few games this morning that went perfectly, instantly getting into games with no issues, but at peak hours (on the EU servers) I've been disconnected a few times. Launch issues are normal and to be expected. 2. Framerate was a bit choppy when I started playing --   this seems to be because the  default view distance is crazy high, lowing it made my game run allot smoother and I could still see players miles away anyways. Overall I'd say this game is fantastic and great fun. While the game was made as a joke, the features are actually implemented really well to the point where I could play this game unironically. Though, it may be worth waiting a few more days to play (Time of this post 8th June) , for launch issues to die down. Though they are mostly fixed at the moment aside from occasional disconnects at the start of the game.",True,False

"Draugen is a great (albeit relatively short) story focused adventure game in league of Dear Esther and Firewatch. It's set in the rustic village of Graavic in 1928. The game emphasize this with a black and white mode (1928 mode that I ofcourse use for full authenticity). The normal colored mode is also cool as it uses pastel-like colours to depict the antic mood of the game. The only thing that I miss in the ""fjord noir"" mode is that the sound will be on narrow bandwith like a very old tv set if you set it to black/white :) You're Edward Harding and you look for your missing sister Betty who wandered off to Norway. Lizzy, companion, jump-in-the-field side kick and game mechanic extraordinaire is adding another dimension to this game. Lizzy is playful and mischievous but also tethers to you in a way that she is a secondary angle to the story as you explore the house and vilage of Graavik. She upgrades the experience of the game in such a way that she reminds me of Elizabeth in Bioshock, minus the steampunk and shooting ofcourse but the character's dynamic interplay equals the mistery, liveliness and sense of autonomy you get from Bioshock's Elizabeth. And becaus she's so jumpy and goes all over the place to drive the story it's nice to have an accessibility feature where you will see her soundwaves from afar when she calls for you (or you call for her, which is a main feature of the game which is later being used in a pretty unique way. The game starts very lighthearted but slowly descends into.....well i'm not at liberty to tell. What I can tell is that the guys from RTG are always able to create a very distinct artistic visual mood in their games. It's an indie game but you can see that the artists come from an AAA background and infuse their exploration game with quality style and the most beautiful scenery. Just like they did with Dreamfall Chapters and TLJ.",True,False

"Good idea to bring bunny hopping to a newer engine, but it needs a lot more work one on the strafing and the feel of the game before its fun to play. I don't think it should copy the strafe style from the source engine but rather make something new that still feels very nice to play if not better. imo it would be best to make something that encourages you to strafe smoothly rather than something where you just have to spam strafes in order to go fast. I would only recommend buying it at this time if you're curious about it and want to support the developer. I'm saying that mainly because of the lack of content, there's only 7 maps in the game right now plus a tutorial map. I think it would be a good idea to allow people to make custom maps and upload them for other people to play, even though the game is no where near to being finished i still think it would be a good idea, because i don't think it would cost much effort to do so and it would make the game a lot more interesting. I wouldn't say its worth buying right now if you're just playing it casually and are not interested in the development of it, but i'm sure it will become a very good game as time goes on.",True,True

"For me, Grand Theft Auto V’s extraordinary scope is summed up in two favourite moments. One is from a mid-game mission in which I flew a plane into another plane, fought the crew, hijacked the thing, and then parachuted out and watched it crash into the sea to escape death at the hands of incoming military fighter jets. Another time, whilst driving around in an off-road buggy, I got distracted by something that looked like a path up one of the San Andreas mountains. Turns out it was a path, and I spent 15 minutes following to the summit, where I nearly ran over a group of hikers. “Typical!” one of them yelled at me, as if he nearly gets run over by a rogue ATV on top of a mountain every time he goes on a hike.",True,False

At first I want to say sorry for my english, I'm from Germany so my english won't be that perfect but I try my best. :D But now to the Review: At the beginnig I wasn't sure if I would like that game, because I thought it would be always the same. You know.. work, eat, sleep, train and fight. And this day by day so.. yeah, I thought this game would be boring and without a story. But that's not true. Of course will be the beginnig of that game like I said: work, eat, sleep, train and fight. But step by step you will have more story and you have to do different things. Sure, everything is about fights, but that why this game is called 'Punch Club' right? ;) So yeah, I really like that game. Now here my list with my pro and contras. :D So that's it. :) Hopefully I could help you a lil bit with my review. :) I give the game a 9,5/10",True,False

"In Slime Rancher you take the role of Beatrix LeBeau (I bet someone came up with that name at a nightly pee-break) who moves far away from earth to earn her money by ranching little colorful, like wobbly Bonbons looking balls. ""Slime Rancher"" consists of three main game mechanics: Exploration, expanding and maintaining your ressources and slimes & researching new gadgets to get those tasks done more easily! You start your first day at your (still empty) ranch... Equipped with a big vacuum cleaner you now start sucking up the little slimes and hoard them in ""corrals""; what a nice little euphemism for ""cages"". Those corals can now be upgraded with special extensions, that help to keep your new little friends happy and safe inside their new homes. You can put different slime types in one corral, but not all slimes come along with each other as you might expect just by looking at their adorable faces. Each time you feed a slime  they develop the natural need to free themselves after a while from the processed food.  Their poo in form of ""plorts"" can be sold to earn money, but if a slime finds a plort from another slime race it will just eat it and voilá... you created a mixture of the two slime races! Those slimes then change their size and look and experimenting which combinations are the most pleasing looking or profitable ones can be a blast!  But be cautious: Some slimes want to be free again and will do everything they can to escape their new corrals... so alway buy them toys, feed them regulary and upgrade their corrals depending on their unique needs! Some combos can even end up into some really evil mutations that try to destroy your farm, infecting other slimes to do the same! The only way to get rid of those ""tarrs"" is shooting water at them.. and then they are gone forever! Let's talk about Slime tech a bit now: After some days you will be introduced into the research of new gadgets, upgrades and tools to gather new ressources (e.g. with pumps that you can place in the landscape) or tools to open tresure boxes that contain blueprints for more slime tech or decorations for your farm. Those gadgets make your life as a rancher easier, add more variety to the gameplayloop and help to personalize your farm... Jep it is indeed! The more you progress in the game, you explore more areas with unique biomes - each area has its own theme, slimes, architecture and music. Exploring the map calms you down a lot after a busy day, if you are stressed out often this is the perfect way to relax and forget the bad things in life for a while - in this game you get a full load of happyness spreaded all over your mind. The pleasing artstyle, combined with mood-enhancing  environmental sounds, neat animations and an ambient, perfectly fitting soundtrack by Harry Mack result in one of the most calming gaming experiences I had in years!...",True,False

"This is not a game for everyone, it has a steep learning curve and many things are not explained to you in-game and require you to use external webtools, read wikis and watch video guides. This is not to say that it's impossible to learn most of the mechanics and inner workings without them, but if you go in blindly expecting to grasp its mechanics all by yourself, you'll have a hard time. With this being said, let's start with the review. The Galaxy  The milky way in a true 1:1 scale featuring over 400 billion star systems, many of which have tens or more planets. There are many places to visit, including famous star systems like Alpha Centauri, Sirius, Canis Majoris, our solar system (Sol), etc. The engine that generates the galaxy gets a lot of its data from real world star catalogues, so most systems that are close to the player's start are from real astronomical data, while the vast majority of the rest is procedurally generated. Other than planets and regular stars, there are black holes, neutron stars, white dwarfs and nebulae to see. Flight Model  This is something this game does very well, flying in this game is so satisfying and immersive. Learning to fly is not difficult, but simply requires a bit of practice. After a while, flying becomes second nature and you'll see yourself docking and exiting stations all the while boosting and avoiding deadly collisions without dropping a sweat... most of the time anyway. Furthermore, the flight model offers a second mode, where the player has much more control over his ship's movement but disables everything that the flight computer does to correct your rotation and trajectory, resulting is easy loss of control and unwanted spinning if the pilot doesn't understand what he's doing. This is not something I'd recommend for newcomers, and even veterans unless they understand the benefits of it, so stick with flight-assist on. So what do you do in this game? You do what you want, really. The freedom is both a gift and a curse of this game, sometimes you lack a direction to go and things to do because unlike other MMOs or games in general, there isn't really a goal to this game unless you make one for yourself. You start small and humble and you make your way up, earn credits, ranks, buy ships, upgrade them, etc. This game has its flaws, it can be grindy sometimes and 'burnouts' can happen! There are 3 different 'playstyles' to this game: Combat (bounty hunting, assassination missions, joining the war effort, piracy, fighting aliens...) Trading (passenger transportation, space trucking, mining, smuggling...) Exploration (discovering planets [and immortalizing your name on them forever], discovering ancient ruins, crashed ships, taking tourists to far away places...) 'Horizons' Season Pass  I highly recommend this DLC, as it's featuring many new mechanics and additions that only improve upon the game, if you're planning on exploring a lot (landing on planets), or if you're into PvP and advanced combat (aliens) this is a must buy. Read my review for the DLC here.",True,False

"Back in the day Borderlands was a real game changer for me (no pun intended). It was one my first PC games bought on Steam, back when it was all sold in dollars, not even local currency. My currency was stronger compared to dollars then, though, much better times. Before Steam my life was basically piracy, buying cracked games ripped in dvds and installing them. It was fun, but Steam opened great windows, and some great games I only had the chance to play after that. Borderlands was one of the first ones from that batch. It wasn't my first great co op experience, though, that one goes for the first Killing Floor and Left 4 Dead. It was my first experience with an RPG style FPS though.  What really has always impressed me about some games that really marked my gaming life, though, is the atmosphere. Nowadays I don't feel that as much, anymore. But back in the start of the decade games like the S.T.A.L.K.E.R series, Metro, Borderlands and others had this great impact. Some time later Borderlands 2 was released and that game is still one of my favorites ever, played it for more than a thousand hours and had tons of fun playing with many friends. Still, I think the atmosphere of the first Borderlands is still a lit better than in BL2. The sound, the western feel... Just amazing. Other than that, if compared to BL2, this game also is less restricted with violence, which contributes a lot for the atmosphere and gameplay. But that's about it. I think Borderlands 2 is better than this game in every other possible aspect. This enhanced version does not feel a lot enhanced, but it is possible to see some graphical improvements. I also enjoy the changes to the HUD system and some of the sounds. It also does feel faster. But the differences to the original seem to stop here. It just a small enhancement, really. Some issues are still there, bugs and warts and all.  Is it worth full price? Not really. Definitely not if you already played the first one. Wait for a nice sale and give it a shot if you never played it.  However, I am grateful to have received this for free and had the opportunity to play this game again and do some of the achievements. Give another shot to the DLC (and some of the terrible grindy missions) and remember some points of the story, before the eventual release of Borderlands 3 on Steam.",True,False

"I think all or at least most people are like what the heck is this game at first, and while playing some of the routes, you ask yourself is this a joke? Well I'll tell you, it's not. This game, even though at some times it is quite humorous, has depth to it. You might not realize it, but after completing this game, you will come out a changed person. It will give some perspective as to how far a person ( or I guess a birdie) will go to keep their word. I would recommend every(birdie)one to play this, even if you think it's not your cup of tea. It's funny and it has a great plot to it, but be prepared for some plot twists. Have a nice day everyone~",True,False

"It's fun if you like puzzle games. I found it relaxing and enjoyable, that is until I got to a certain point of the game. I think they were onto something with this. The blue and red stages were very fun and enjoyable, and I wish they would have stuck with that concept and pushed it throughout the entire game. Although at the time of writing this review, I only have a half hour on it, it was mostly because it stopped being fun and enjoyable once I got to the green section. It was fun, enjoyable, relaxing, that is until it kicked you in the face with the green part and was more frustrating than anything. That's not to say there isn't a person that would love this game. Anybody that derives an enjoyment from hard puzzles should absolutely love this game. But I'll have to say, if you're interested because you just want to unwind on something simple and fun, you'll only enjoy the first ~20 minutes worth of this game. After that, it stops becoming relaxing and more mentally intensive. If, in the future, they release another version of this game with just blue and maybe red sections of this game expanded upon further without throwing in the green and beyond, that is something that I would completely recommend. For now, though, I'm torn on a recommendation. I can't simply say yes, and I can't simply say no. It's a game for a type of person. If you are that puzzley, determined person, then this is completely for you. If you're somebody that gets frustrated easily, this isn't for you.",True,False

You may change every single part of your robot. And of course, a great local multiplayer. If you never played SSB before, it is still a great alternative, as most of SSB abilities are available here, and unlike SSB, you're the one who chooses which abilities you're carrying with you.

"Greetings This is my first review.   At first I was disappointed becasue my named got changed from Sesshomaru to Sesshoomaru. After playing almost two years now I got used to my name and even my friends call me Sess now days.    This game is a fun game to sit down and play during a long day at work or school. You really do feel like you are a Lord ruling over your own villages in a bigger empire picture with all the other Lords and Ladys and helping your fellow players along the way.  In this game is where you can met people all over the world and you can help each other out. You can work together and fight together and its also great way to play with your friends too.    I also like how Stronghold has added more quest to to earn cards and wheel spins. Good job! I think it would be cool if Stronghold have automonks to send out cure disease or even bless of your own parishes. How about away to save you village like the way you save your castle? So all and all I have fun playing and excited about what new upgrades will come out next.   Here is helpful tip, When its say ""steam needs to be online"" which steam is online, well don't threat do I as do.  Right click on the mini steam icon in the task bar and click on stronghold and play. I hope that helps if it dose leave me a thumbs up!   You can come follow me in House 3 in World 3 eng.

"How do I even begin to review this masterpiece. Best sniper game on the market for sure and especially best sniper game that takes place in the World War II era. I had really high expectations regarding this game and they broke every single one of them, whatever went wrong in Sniper Elite III like the AI for example has been fixed in SE4. I also like how Stealth is less nuanced and you can go full rambo if you so choose. I really like the overhaul to the CQB takedowns you can pull off and the revamped kill cam is just hilarious to see sometimes. I also love the new added element of environmental kills and added killcams for those kills. Gives the game a whole new dynamic to me. The best thing about this game are the realistic mechanics a real life sniper would come in contact with. Unless you play on Cadet difficulty you can't just point your crosshair at someone's head and expect a instant headshot on him. You really have to take the distance of the shot and the wind in consideration and account for the bullet drop, which is even worse on silenced ammo, and adjust your aim accordingly.  And yes there is the new Kill Hitler DLC, but I honestly don't mind this is the third time they made it. Honestly I can't think of anything more fun to kill Hitler by sniping his jewels. This is a great game, and I've waited a long time for it. For me personally hands down the best game I bought this year. 10/10.",True,False

"Creativerse is an open world multiplayer crafting/building game. Along the same aspects of Minecraft but with a lot of extras. Obviously with the success of Minecraft (Mojang 2011) there have been tons of games that are around the same aspect of being able to build whatever your imagination can think of. Well Creativerse lets you do that. Now there's two different versions of the game currently. Obviously there's the Free to Play version but ther's also the Creativerse - Pro version ($19.99) which gives you the features to create multiple worlds and be able to customize them with additional advanced options, a glider to be able to fly through the skys as you're looking for somewhere to build, a flashlight to be able to see in front of you in dark areas, additional backpack slots (+20), +100% more stamina and you're able to claim 2 stakes for free in every world. Even without paying for the Pro version there's tons of stuff you can do in Creativerse. You can travel through a gigantic world that has wide a variety of enviroments each with creatures. Underground is just as immersive but it's a lot more dangerous than the overworld, so if you're looking for a survival challenge underground is the place to be. There's day/night cycles, weather cycles, temperature and tons of other things that make this game beyond amazing. As for building there's a blueprint system that you can follow and build amazing structures step by step as it shows you how or you can just go off on your own and create whatever your mind feels like. There's over 400 pieces of material to build with, wireless machines and complex interactions such as creature spawning, block manipulation, checkpoints and much more. If you're the type that likes to play sandbox games alone you can build your own private world and build to your hearts content. But even with a private world you have the ability to invite your friends so they can see your creations. Meeting new people and seeing amazing designs is very simple in Creativerse, you have the ability to browse through live player worlds. When you do that you have the ability to visit the world or stake your claim and make your own home in that world. Get out there, get inspired and build alongside this wonderful community that is Creativerse.",True,False

"F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin | October 18, 2020 | [★★] In my opinion, It is a very clean made game. Throughout my play-through, I've never encountered a thing that it shouldn't be there. I think being super linear helps a lot in that case. Gameplay is pretty much shoot and kill then enter the next level - enemy spawn there and do the same. The AI's movement felt generic making them easy to read. I've only died 2 times (Excluding those failed grenade attempt) throughout the campaign in Normal mode. I can't say otherwise on other difficulty but it was an easy course game. The story doesn't really give a lot until it finally became clear by reading through massive hundred journals scattered around the game. It sometimes wasn't fun reading those but at least it picked up half the game that it makes me intrigue and engage with what's happening. I've never actually played the first one and this one make me want to check it to see what I've been missing. Overall experience is a big thing for me and sadly this just gave me a flat one. I knew horror is one of the main theme of this game, but I've never felt that. Jumpscape doesn't really bothers me specially with no consequences unlike Dead Space where those who freak you, can actually kill you and that makes it more terrifying. I just wish this game have that.",True,False

"-Unique gameplay mechanics which makes it standout from usual traits of this genre of games. -Great environmental,graphical (effects, textures and model) design. -One of the most if not the most gore-filled, violent and revolting game of this current gen. -Free for existing owners. -Superior art direction conveying the gore and horror petrified halls of hell. -Tons of unlockable content,modes and different endings. -Improving on almost all aspects of its predecessor. -fairly priced for the content it has to offer -Gameplay tends to become repetitive fairly quick. -Transparent storyline. -Unevenly placed checkpoints. -Choppy voice-acting. -Limited interaction with the vast environment. -Fickle stealth mechanics which causes too many sudden death encounter progressing throughout the game.   The story itself follows a lost soul trapped in the depth of the horrifying hellscapes without any memories of his former life. Slowly its revealed of what's the protagonist's backstory, he was a ruler of an ancient land who made a Faustian bargain with the Red Goddess. In-story, he is referred to as both Nimrod by the Goddess and other trapped souls some of whom still have their memories, blaming the protagonist for them being destined to hell because of his rather negative acts he performed while alive. As the protagonist wanders through the wastelands of hell, he discovers a possibility of escaping through the aid and guidance of the Red Goddess. Eventually, he travels to the Red Goddess' lair to learn how he can be set free from the torments of hell. The game itself is a mix-match of Puzzle, Exploration and Stealth. The first person perspective is highlighted mostly during the exploration. The environments are highly detailed with hints of finding notes and other important things that leads you to a better understanding of what's going on. The wormhole of gore gets worse with every step people mutilated beyond recognition, pools of blood etc. Uses of tools provided such as torches opens new paths but attracts more enemies. Stealth here is the most highlighted mechanic which gets u through most of the later stages. Camouflage by hiding in mounds of corpses is crucial to the game's progression. Puzzles in particular is pretty easy mainly consisting of finding and delivering items. Certain types of enemies can also be avoided in a puzzle like manner with the help of the aid of notes and some others by yourself. Overall sometimes it may come off as all shock, and no substance. The take on hell is amazing, but the underlying gameplay can become frustrating.  You will begin your journey as a tormented soul within the depths of hell, without any memories about your past. The special ability to control people on your path, and even possess simple minded demons, gives you the necessary measures to survive in the extreme conditions you are in. By exploring the hostile environment and interacting with other weary souls of the hellscape, the protagonist will soon understand that there is only one way to escape from Hell, and it will require meeting the mystical Red Goddess. By summing up notes the storyline and dialogues are revealed. The narration slowly hints at some lore with the eventual progression and slowly reveals the ""Big Picture"". Definitely the best aspect it shines the most. Brilliant depiction of hell and its miseries with the help of Unreal Engine 4 delivers on a solid experience. Great sound design and music, even though it isn't much noticeable some dialogues don't sync up which makes the voice acting feel a bit lacklustre. The game itself is very demanding maybe because of the absence of optimization but didn't notice anything huge while running on a system based on (gtx 1050 ti,16gb ram) frame rates are pretty solid too. Nothing sevre got bought to my attention. Safe to say no major bugs in this incarnation. Agony is a game not made keeping the mainstream gamers in mind so it's obviously not everyone's cup of tea. But for those willing to experience it the game ensures a solid horror experience. Overall a reasonably priced horror experience.",True,False

"Very little Spoiler warning ahead: LiS: Before the Storm was quite interesting. I loved the game as Max and it became so much to me. I cryed so often and the characters who where created felt like family. I Pre- Ordered this game because i was flashed when I heard I get to play more of the Story and know a bit more about the whole. So i was completly flashed when i played the first Episode. So full of nostalgia and see all the old AND finally Rachel was a complete burst. I played the 2nd Episode and it was ok. I was able to kiss the new character i truely love and wanted to know how these Story´s matches together. Then today the last Episode came out and it took quite a bit but today was the day and I couldn´t wait. It took me round about 3 hours and im kinda confused. The Ending wasen´t the Ending i wanted and as in the Original we only had 2 ""END- Desicions"" wich was normally completly fine but this was different. If you just look at the game itself I can recommend it. If i look at the game out of my perspective: I can still recommend it. But it wasen´t the last thing i wanted to make out of this whole Story and I´m left out now with a bit of an unsafe feeling wich wanted more and didn´t became it. Maby thats all why im feeling not quite fullfilled with the last episode. But none of the less its a fantastic game wich every ""Real Player"" should play and think about decisions, life and much more. If you read till now i gotta thank you for reading and i hope you will love the whole Series as much as I do ... :hearth:",True,False

Yeah, it's bugged up to the eyeballs, and the occasional CTD can get a little frustrating, but I personally blame it on my inability to load Mod orders correctly, lol. There are plenty of fixes out there; and considering the sheer mammoth size of the modding community, there are countless ways to renovate, enhance and completely alter the experience each play through. You get out what you put in with this one I'm afraid. I wouldn't recommend it for those who don't care much for modding, aren't too savvy with mods, or simply don't want to sink the time and effort into finding and installing them (correctly). The stability of the game may suffer for it (at times), but if you've set up your mods correctly the collateral damage is pretty unnoticeable, and will only rear its ugly head from time to time. Some mods even exist to minimize/fix certain problems that exist in the vanilla game, or as a by-product of other mods. Suffice it to say, if you're inclined to buy this game and you find yourself enjoying the experience, You'll be spoilt for choice, and replaying the game over and over again to sample all that the game, and the modding community, has to offer!",True,False

The Witcher is a great RPG to have and probably the best from the trilogy although this game doesn't have controller support and relies on keyboard and mouse for the controls which will put some people off. The game was released in 2008 and has aged well with the graphics still looking nice after all this time. The gameplay is addictive with a good story to boot. I would recommend getting the full trilogy.,True,False

After that, the problem solved after Jun loss his virginity on the same day, it was so straight forward that Dean never ever dare to question about the broken vase anymore.

"What can I say ... The game can graphically distract some people, but it's the best team shooter I've ever played with my friends, especially, it has been one of the few that has kept us together for so long. The Level System is very scabby, but I could live with it. So many funny, panic and adrenaline-fueled moments always made many small mistakes of the game betting. The mechanisms are not super carefully designed but the game has always conveyed a real experience with some friends. Nevertheless, I recommend rather just take Killing Floor 2, it's definitely worthwhile.",True,False
Very fun but is much more fun if you play with friends,True,False
"I recently finished this game, after playing the first one and the expansion packs. I already called Half-Life 1 one of the best games i've ever played, but this one is my all-time favourite. The game is not even nearly perfect, it is perfect. It's action packed, it got GREAT graphics, animations and more for a game from 2004 and it even got moments which were truly epic. Unlike the first one, this one offers more puzzles, greater and more evoirments and more action and even a little bit of horror in it. You not only fight against one enemy, no you get to fight headcrabs, helicopters, City 17 Guards, zombies and more. You kill them on your own creative way around the middle of the game when you get more weapons like the Gravity gun, one of my favourites. It let you travel to so many cool area's and not only on foot.. You get to travel to there with for example a car. Absolutly amazing. It's one of the few games of 2004 that offered so many beatiful content and realistic fighting. For example, around the end of the game, you get to control rebels against City 17, they help you, and give you health if needed. Sure, it got it's bugs, sometimes it also brought me motion sickness.. But that didin't stopped me from playing it. The ending and the mysterious G-Man makes me wanna' play Episode 1, which i surely will. It's only 9 bucks, so if you want to spent that money on a epic journey with enough replay valaue, then go ahead. Buy this game, a game which i think, never gets old and always will stay one of a kind.",True,False

The first person animations are beautiful and the gore is tarantino level good! Enemies are far more of a challenge and grow as you play different difficulties.

"Hello, I'm Charley Tank and if you don't know who I am then I'm a Tester for nanos the creator of JC3MP. I have been playing this wonderful game Since before the first public beta it has come a long way since that day. I have spent countless hours recording videos on the test server I also Recorded the Trailers for the Beta release and the Steam release so I'm quite Familiar to this wonderful game. This is a video of scrapped trailer footage some made it and some didn't but it was all so fun to record and I would do it again over and over 10 times. I actually have a lot of good things to say about this Multiplayer Mod because I got to play with it before the public not just because of that but I made a lot of new friends becoming a tester  (Thank you Protato) I have sacrificed a little to gain so much and for that, I have to Thank Nanos & Square Enix. I have tested the Multiplayer Mod on 10 different computers with 10 totally different settings from an i5 3570k with a single GTX 660Ti right up to my latest build an i9 7900x with a 1080Ti the same results on every test sure there are some bugs but nanos works on these with every new patch and it's getting better and better the game is playable and stable this is a live stream I did on launch day. I have done over 47 videos on the Multiplayer and have never had so much fun in all my life on Any game as I have had on Just Cause 3 Multiplayer. I play on Gaveroids Just Cause 3 Multiplayer server not because they put my name in the game but because that's where all my friends play I appreciate everything nanos has done for me if your a real Just cause 3 fan like me try out the Multiplayer you will see what kind of mayhem you can cause there are so many different possibilities so many ideas, road trips - cargo plane air force -  mountain climbing - you name it you can do it. I have been stunting trying a lot of different things on the Multiplayer The DLC servers are the best mech fight with 50 People? what are you waiting for stop reading this and hop on the Multiplayer?

"In the Game of CK III you win or you die... Ok, most probably you will die quite often anyway, but as long as you have a good heir your dynasty will live on, and that´s what counts. With the improved Legacy bonus for Dynasties even more now than before. This is actually one - of quite many - improvements they have included in the third installement of the game. From the lifestyle focus trees for each character to the Dynasty, Faith and Culture trees, you have now much more influence on how to develop.. which also is easier to understand and plan imo. Also down to every character attribute they have much more influences on many decisions ingame.  Besides this, the gameplay is very much like the second part of course, you make Marriages and Alliances to rise in the world. Then you die by gout or someone murders you.. through accident.  The things which are a bit annoying so far are a bad overview at the map level, especially in warfare.. often you don´t even see your armies anymore, because the map view changed for some reason.  The warfare itself also got a bit improved, with specialised troop types, which add to your normal levies. The overview is in part the biggest problem, since the news snippets plop up and go away again, i have not seen much options for changing them.. or reading older ones. Also windows close automatically, when you click a news which makes you open them up again and again. Otherwise regarding bugs the game seems mostly stable and in working order, especially for this fresh stage of release. The music can be still much improved (in comparison to CKII), but is not annoying at least.  Conclusio: Looking forward to many more centuries of crusading ;) - No, honestly, if you liked the second part, get it.. and even if it was too complicated, you can risk a glance, since in my opinion it got quite a bit easier to understand and transparent.

"Initially, I was disappointed in the map being largely covered by an inhospitable mountain range. Still, it's content and scenery made up for this. Elsweyr continues the adventure that started with the Wrathstone DLC and is noteworthy for it's introduction of the Necromancer Class, making this expansion highly desirable. Elsweyr features several new recipes across the crafting portfolio including jewellery, effecting Homestead, trading, combat - which indicates a respectable amount of work detail and creativity. The main quest continues into the Dragonguard DLC. Upon it's completion a bloody great host of quests becomes available.  There's another free house that's unlocked through the year long story line. You will have the best time zerg-ing the enormous dragons or World Bosses here.  To summarise, highly recommended for fans of the Elder Scrolls - get into it.",True,False

"10tons (the developer) is showing some really good business practices with Tesla vs Lovecraft. They took an amazing but outdated game, Crimsonland, and instead of ""reskinning"" it and releasing it with Lovecraft themed monsters, they built upon their successful game design, creating an even smoother gaming experience.  Tesla vs Lovecraft has a decent sized campaign (3 hours) which is a series of small maps you have to clear of monsters and can be replayed on 2 higher difficulties while keeping all of your upgrades. Instead of a vast empty space like in Crimsonland, here each map is small and packed with obstacles some of which destructible. This allows for a more tactical gameplay because you can lure the monsters in tight alleys or corners and release Tesla's electric wrath upon them. Your ability to teleport and call in a mechanical suit allow you to plow through your enemies and quickly disengage when you're outnumbered. This makes the gameplay far more dynamic and a bit more casual (on the first difficulty at least, it becomes much harder afterwards). The DLC is adequatly priced and fully optional as it is mostly aimed at hard-core fans.",True,False

"This game from Sigma Team is an easy to pick isometric shooter.  Despite it's age and graphics, the fun factor is great.  Also, the small but effective improvements you can buy allow you a bit of customisation  on the gameplay style.  Different weapons ARE different, and you have to be careful with reload times.  Hordes and hordes of aliens come to get you. You can also use the environment on your favor, like doors , corridors ans such.  Sound assests are good. When you mix aliens with explosions, grenade launchers and mayhem,  it gets really really rewarding. Usually this game along with others (from Sigma Team) appear on bundles,  or heavily discounted not only on steam but also in other sites (i.e. Indie Gala).  When you are bored, and want a quick and mindless session you can fire a chapter , or even play a survival session.  Play it with v-sync off, to avoid some problems.  It runs on a toaster, so it's perfect for those (like me) that have ancient hardware around.",True,False
"Alpha Prime the Plot:  The State Business Federation has discovered an asteroid dubbed Alpha Prime with rich deposits of hubbardium, which is used as fuel in interstellar ships. During the mining operations, the miners began to go mad due to exposure to hubbardium. The State Business Federation decided that mining the hubbardium is too dangerous, and sealed off the asteroid. The protagonist, Arnold Weiss, is recruited by an old friend, Livia, to rescue their mutual friend, Warren Reynolds, who was trapped on the asteroid when it was sealed off. Arnold grudgingly accepts, and they head off in a ship called the Artemis. The ship is disabled by a mine before they reach the asteroid, however, and only Arnold and Livia survive. Arnold gets into an escape pod and lands on Alpha Prime alone. After fighting his way through malfunctioning robots and miners driven mad by hubbardium exposure, Arnold meets up with an Italian member of the Association of Freelance Prospector's named Paolo Bellini. Paolo gives Arnold a device known as a ReCon, used to hack into a variety of electronics, and agrees to help him. Paolo then suggests they go further into the complex to escape the insane miners. After another run in with robots, Paolo is injured and decides to stay behind when Arnold goes to survey the area. The two notice that the area is now crawling with enforcers from the company that originally controlled the mining operation. Arnold gets in contact with another employee trapped on Alpha Prime, Bruce Lawrence, who assists him in opening some doors. On the way back, the leader of the enforcers, Colonel Olivier, finds Paolo and asks him about Glomar, an urban legend said to be the source of hubbardium. Paolo attempts to escape, but is killed. Livia contacts Arnold again to explain that she has been hiding from Colonel Olivier's ship, but Bruce later informs him that Livia had been transmitting directly to Olivier. Using the complex's tram system, Arnold finally makes his way to Warren. Warren reveals that Livia was on Alpha Prime when the Company first tried to acquire the heart of Glomar, now confirmed to be the source of the radiation which transforms rock into hubbardium. Something went wrong and during the Company's flight, Livia abandoned Warren to go with them. Warren removes the information about how to find Glomar's heart, which constantly moves, from Alpha Prime's database, and attempts to hide it. Olivier's men fake an image of Paolo approaching the room on the security cameras, leading Warren to go outside to get him. Arnold realizes it's a trap, but gets over to Warren too late, who is captured. Arnold chases Olivier and Warren to Olivier's ship, which he also hopes to use to escape the asteroid after rescuing Warren. Warren, however, inspired by an act of Paolo's, sets off an explosion as a distraction to escape, also resulting in the ship being rendered unusable. Arnold gets a tip that Warren might be headed to an old mining site, and drives a buggy across the asteroid's surface to reach it. Arnold meets up with Bruce there, only to find out that Olivier already caught Warren, stole the database containing the location of Glomar's heart, and left him for dead. With his dying breath, Warren informs Arnold that when you touch the heart, it does whatever you expect it to. Arnold insists he's going after Olivier so Bruce leaves because he only wants to escape the asteroid. Arnold tracks Olivier to an old mine and begins descending into it. Along the way, Olivier, who now wants the heart for himself, contacts Arnold and insists that they both have the same goal: keeping the heart away from the Company. He also warns Arnold of a spy by the codename of Coral Snake, who is a mutual acquaintance he insists cannot be trusted. Arnold speculates that Coral Snake may not even exist at all, and is only a myth to turn Arnold against his friends. Arnold finally reaches Olivier, who is about to pick up Glomar's heart. He threatens to kill him, but Olivier insists that Arnold would not shoot next to such a precious object. Instead, Arnold convinces Olivier that Glomar will destroy Olivier if he picks it up. With the doubt in his mind, Warren's prediction turns out true as Olivier is transformed into a hideous abomination upon touching the heart. Arnold defeats the corrupted Olivier and goes to pick up the heart himself. Bruce contacts Arnold, only to be cut off by the sounds of a struggle. Livia, who had landed the Artemis, arrives and tries to stop Arnold from picking up the heart. Arnold does anyway, however, and asks Livia if she can guess his wish. Livia approaches him and shoots him dead, revealing that she was Coral Snake. The game ends with a shot of Arnold's corpse as Livia insists to Company members that Arnold has the heart and she needs to get it out of his body. She requests an autopsy and Arnold's head turns, revealing green glowing eyes as the screen fades to black. Pros: - Great Music during the gameplay - Good graphics from year 2007 - Nasty and Funny dialogues with characters xd Cons: - Mediocre Story Line - Fewer weapons to choise - Perfect aiming on the Enemies ( Becarefull they have aim bot ) Of course i only recommend it to buy it on big big discounts :)",True,False

Pros: - CURVY ROADS - Adustable height of the roads allowing for customized interchanges - Renewable Energy is the main power source that you will use. - Train/Subway/Bus Routs are editable and can be color coordinated. - Cities grow based upon services and leisure and educated near them. - Mods, 74,000+ mods. - Intuituve Menu Layout - Great AI - Base Game is worth the price Cons:  - DLC has too little content for too high a price. Yeah that's all the cons. If I had to I would give this game a very nice 93/100. It's got a lot of polish added to it and it's worth every cent you put into it. Buy this, you won't regret it at all.",True,False
"Alright, who's here because of brutalmoose? Despite his rather harsh review, my curiosity got the best of me, and thus here I am. So is this game truly awful, or is there more to the story? Let's start with the basics. Chantelise is an action adventure game that's somewhat of a JRPG as well, for reasons we'll get into soon. A quick gander might lead you to think that this is a long-lost PS1 game, judging by the graphics and sound. However, Chantelise is actually an indie game from 2006, back when the indie scene was far less established. So whether by necessity and/or conscious design choice, the overall style is technically only one or two generations old, which makes it rather unique today. I find the 2D-like sprites and low polygon count quite charming, and the accompanying sounds are the same way. It's just something you don't see often, as it's not ""retro"", nor is it realistic. Fortunately, the horrible pixelation you see on many PS1 games is smoothed out, and the audio quality is decently better as well. The hand-drawn characters are pretty good, though nothing super special. All in all, save for a couple frame drops, Chantelise feels like a slightly remastered game from the late 90's, and that's pretty neat. So then, what is this tale of two sisters about? In short, older sister Chante has been turned into a fairy, and so she flies alongside her younger sister Elise as they look to undo the curse. They come across a caring shopkeeper named Aira, as well as an enigmatic fortune teller named Elma, among others. From there, the sisters venture through four elemental-themed dungeons (plus a final place) as they discover the truth behind their legend. It's certainly not the most profound story, but it does work well through its own simplicity. There's plenty of whimsy to be had as well, particularly on Chante's behalf. She's always making wisecracks, while Elise balances her out with sweetness. I think the localization is especially good at making this work, as each of those one-liners are delivered just perfectly. It really speaks volumes how a competent translation can do wonders. I was invested in the story, even if it wasn't groundbreaking. Now for the real meat of the review: how does Chantelise play? You control Elise as she moves around a 3D space, attacks enemies with her sword, and uses Chante for magic. Levels consist of small screens with unique challenges and enemies, all with a boss screen at the end. That's where the action and adventure parts come in, though I'm not sure if I'd call it an RPG. Stats are only managed on a basic level, and there's no real progression system, save for plot advancements. The money you collect from enemies functions somewhat as experience points, which you exchange for equipment and HP levels (which you need to do often). Equipment is also gained in dungeons by doing certain tasks. It's a cool idea in concept, as it encourages you to play around in each screen, but the conditions are arbitrary, and ultimately it's better to use a guide to get everything. While these treasures are optional, you'll really need them to keep up with the game's difficulty, which is very unforgiving, particularly without preparations. Many people say this game is hard, perhaps too hard, and I can't blame them for thinking so. Some players may resort to grinding, though it'll only get you so far. You'll have to adapt to lots of obstacles in your adventure, and they won't be easy. Oddly enough, the first boss is probably the second most difficult in the game (that final boss, yikes), and it's no wonder why so many give up at that point. Another issue I had is that the camera is very unwieldy. While more manageable with a controller, it's tough to lock onto enemies and let go when needed. I eventually got used to it, but it took time, and I still had issues throughout the game. Once you can get past the issues, the game has a nice rhythm to it, but expect to mess up often. I'd say it's not for everyone, but if you can put in some effort and forgive some esoteric choices, there's fun to be had. Well then, is Chantelise a good game? To me, it was fun despite some problems. You really have to be patient and understanding with the game, which may not make it enjoyable to some people. I think the fun story makes for a good driving force to continue though. If you think Chantelise is the type of game you might enjoy, it probably is. Chantelise certainly isn't a masterpiece, but I can't help but feel it's at least better than the critics told us.",True,False
"Pros ___ Challenging in a balanced way. Weapon upgrades helps you have a easier time later on in the game. Graphics is great even if you put the texture low if you have a weaker PC or Ultra if you have a powerful PC Tombs would give you treasure maps or useful rewards Intense Cons ___ If you get frustrated easily, Then this game would make you rage. The timing in combats would take some time to master. There is moments where you shouldn't died but it's a minor issue. The game is Action focused but it adds the intensity into the game.",True,False

Btw my computer's temperature is starting to melt the floor beneath it, it may be concerning for you but to me, it shows how much of an epic gamer I am. I have also founded the Martin O'Donnell cult, where true believers of the great journey can ascend from PeeOnMe Industries.   20th August 2020 They found out I was hiding in the basement after a melted wooden plank fell on my moms head putting her in a severe coma, I am on the run holding my PC as I run, now the S.W.A.T team is involved in this. I have resorted to melting snow to get water and hunting 343 industry members. 25th August 2021 The FBI has been tracking me down for five months they've already brought in the entire U.S military, I managed to take down two soldiers after they compared halo to mumble rap, now the military is using napalm bombs to destroy the forest I'm in, throughout this whole journey I have caused 1000000 blackouts after wasting tons of electricity on this game. Don't ask how I managed to power the pc in the middle of a forest. 30th September 2021 An FBI agent just shot my leg, I had to drag myself to safety and hide under a log as they ran into the forest, suddenly the entire Russian, Australian, Chinese, North Korean, South Korean, Japanese, American and German military came and started shooting down the forest, As I attempted to get away a Tsar-Bomb was dropped, as I lay dying I am proud as I know that my son will carry on the same glorious actions as I did. 10/10 great game Halo 4",True,False

"Off = Uma dica, a grande parte dos problemas com esse jogo são com anti virus, tente desativar ele por um tempo se o jogo fechar sozinho em sua maquina.  Dragon Age™ Inquisition é um ótimo e incrível rpg, joguei por mais de 120 horas e tenho certeza que não vi mais que 75 % do jogo. Melhoram o jogo na parte técnica (Gráficos lindos e jogabilidade melhorada), continuaram a trama da franquia de forma incrível e trouxeram elementos que muita gente gostou no primeiro jogo (origens, de certa forma) e expandiram outros que estavam fracos (exploração). O jogo é super recomendado por mim pra todo fã de rpg, principalmente quem jogou os outros dragon ages, vale o valor cheio e com desconto fica imperdível.  Continuando depois do fim de DA 2 (que de qualquer forma termina na revolta dos magos) o jogo já teria um pano de fundo interessante, mas então um desastre acontece e as coisas se complicam mais ainda, um único sobrevivente sai da experiência com poderes especiais e cabe a você escolhar a raça, sexo e profissão dessa pessoa, a escolha não muda todo começo do jogo, como origem, mas muda quest e dialogos no jogo e várias escolhas tomam tonalidades diferentes, dependendo que tipo de personagem está fazendo. Você vai ser questionado quanto sua fé no Criador, se acredita ser um escolhido e todo tipo de  escolha moral durante o jogo, algumas bem fáceis dependendo sua historia, mas algumas muito difíceis, mais que nos outros DA, não vou comentar mais sobre eles, mas pra quem gosta dessa fator, o jogo é ótimo nesse aspecto. Os personagens, principalmente companheiros estão como sempre detalhados e interessantes, o vilão poderia ser melhor, mas a realidade é que ele É melhor, só que você vai demorar pra saber disso (hehe). As quest principais são muito bem escritas e seguem o padrão meio linear do outros jogos, as side quest como sempre variam entre bem detalhadas á muito simples (mas agora todas tem um motivo em comum: ajudar alguém em nome da inquisição), mudaram a ""exploração de corredor"" dos DA pra vários mapas semi-abertos, você não precisa nem pisar em várias localidades pra terminar o jogo, mas se quiser, vai encontrar várias quest, inimigos, colecionáveis e equipamentos, muito gente achou essa  modalidade muito repetitiva (compararam a UBISOFT), mas na realidade ela é muito melhor que a dos outros jogos, e pode ser quase que totalmente ignorada por quem não gosta ( e mesmo assim o jogo vai durar mais que 40 horas, acredito). Repetindo, recomendo e espero pela sequência  muito ansioso. ------------------------------ Off = A tip, most problems with this game are with anti virus, try to disable it for a while if the game closes alone on your machine. Dragon Age ™ Inquisition is a great and amazing rpg, I played for over 120 hours and I'm sure I haven't seen more than 75% of the game. They improved the game on the technical side (beautiful graphics and improved gameplay), continued the story of the franchise in an incredible way and brought elements that many people liked in the first game (origins, in a way) and expanded others that were weak (exploration). The game is super recommended by me for every fan of rpg, especially those who played the other dragon ages, it is worth the full amount and with discount, is a must. Continuing after the end of DA 2 (which in any case ends in the mages' revolt) the game would already have an interesting background, but then a disaster happens and things get even more complicated, a single survivor leaves the experience with special powers and it’s up to you to choose that person’s race, sex and profession, the choice doesn’t change all the beginning of the game, as on origin, but it does change quests and dialogues in the game and various choices take different tones, depending on what type of character you’re making. You will be asked how much your faith in the Creator, whether you believe to be a chosen one and all kinds of moral choices during the game, some very easy depending on your story, but some very difficult, more than in the other DA, I will not comment on them anymore, but for those who like this factor, the game is great in that aspect. The characters, especially companions are, as always, detailed and interesting, the villain could be better, but the reality is that he IS better, but it will take you a while to know that (hehe). The main quests are very well written and follow the linear pattern of other games, the side quests as always vary from very detailed to very simple (but now they all have a common reason: to help someone in the name of the inquisition), changed the "" corridor exploration ""of the DA for several semi-open maps, you don't even have to step on several locations to finish the game, but if you want, you will find several quests, enemies, collectibles and equipment, many people found this modality very repetitive (compared UBISOFT), but in reality it is much better than the other games, and can be almost totally ignored for those who doesn't like it (and even so the game will last more than 40 hours, I believe). Again, I recommend and wait for the sequence very anxious.",True,False

"Quick Intro: The game is based in a steampunk medieval time. You are a Swordsman (sorry Fighter) after realising halfway through the game you are a female protagonist lol, who is wanting to prove her worth and become a part of the league of fighters and will do anything to protect her village. Graphics: The artwork and scenes in he entire game are beautiful and well designed, it may look basic but it’ll always want you to keep on playing and see what more monster designs, quest, bosses, and other heroes you will get to see along the way.  As for the important part the game runs very smoothly and even on laptops so no need to play worry if you wanted to play it as you won’t be needing a 4k high spec computer. Gameplay: The game is designing to be half Final Fantasy and Half Yugioh. It’s a turn-based game where each Character is allowed up to 8 cards, through the battle system you can use cards, to protect, boost or Attack. With many different cards and variations, the game become lot of fun as you start to explore different cards for your characters. Customising your deck to make certain characters brawler, mages, and “back up dancers “I mean Support. Not much else should be said as if you are a fan of turn-based and card games then I will leave the secrets for players who would like to purchase this game and explore for themselves.  Advantages: No matter what level you are at gaming, this game is brilliant for Beginners and for Advances players as the tutorial explain it very clearly how to play the game, help give you tips and combinations, so that when you reach chapter 3 you will be a professional at playing this game, discovering new combos, strategies and tactics. Disadvantages: Nothing negative to say about this game as I need to play more of it to see if there are bugs or errors in the game except you can say the game is alittle pricey for now but with Steam sales, if its low in price I would buy it. Overall: I would recommend this game is any fan of yugioh or Final Fantasy as you will have a blast and enjoy the concept of the game. I’d rate this game a 8/10. Hope you all enjoy this review Peace out.",True,False

The world is incredibly beautiful, the characters will grow on you and the port is amazing, I only have a semi-decent PC and have yet to experience any problems.

"Wanting to become a kungfu master but lack the physical training? Fear not, now you can become the best kungfu master ever!  One finger death punch is a simple brawler that requires only 2 keys to play (left and right). There is no complicated hard to pull off combos to memorize here. Show your mastery in kungfu by pressing the right key at the right time as hordes of enemies come rushing at you from both sides. Certain enemies such as the boss will take multiple hits to kill, while other enemies carry weapons which they may throw or shoot at you if you are not being careful. On the other hand, you can also grab these weapons dropped from your enemies to use, for example, a gun with enable you to shoot (effectively killing enemies normally outside of your melee range). As you play through the levels, you can earn gems to unlock skills, such as slowing down the time or increasing your range of attack. All very helpful to help you kick their asses harder. In addition, there is survival mode and co-op where you can play with another friend.  Overall, this game is highly recommended if you are looking for a simple yet fun brawler to play.",True,False

"The game in general is quite well executed, but doesn't do much renewing the genre or anything. It builds on the foundations that have been laid out for Metroidvanias, so be prepared to mark areas that you can't yet proceed through to make it easier to know where to backtrack too. Personally I'd have liked the ability to have different coloured markers (as to indicate new skills needed or just treasures). For me this was quite annoying once, since I forgot to mark a certain gate, and it was the only point of progression, which meant I had to go throughout all the maps and check everything out (I feel like this is more on me than on the game though). Besides this the soundtracks are quite basic but nice to listen to anyway and won't annoy you into turning off the sound. The environments look really nice and fit well with the rest of the style of the game. The magic feels a bit basic (and honestly strong as in most of these games) but to be fair I haven't used much of it since I prefer combat over magic. The different types of weapons are quite nice, however since it's (somewhat) randomly generated you quite often find weapons weaker than the ones you already have. The only real performance problem I encountered was quite odd and I'm genuinely not sure if anyone else would ever encounter it. I'm using a Xbox Bluetooth Controller, which means it might sometimes (temporarily) lose connection, most of the time this is just for a second, however Chasm really doesn't seem to like this. Whenever my controller would lose connection the game would slow down to being pretty much unplayable, yet recover to normal speed when the connection was restored.

"This review is only about Dawn of war 2 singleplayer campaign. Gameplay is very straightfoward and fast. There are wide variety of abilities and units you can select to slay your foes. Different enemies requires different tools of the trade. There are so many mixes you can combine with available items and abilities that game keeps interesting for a good time. Although 10 000 slayed orcs later you feel like you have seen it all. Boss fights are disapointing as every boss just takes 1 000 times more dmg than average unit and launches some special blast at a pre-marked zone. Bosses gets repetive really fast. Main plot and characters are well written and fits perfect to wh40k's rich lore.  I like the idea that you simple don't have time to do every mission there are available. You have to excecute missions that suits your overall situation best. Also there are usually 2 strategic assets on the map and you can only conquer one of them. There are 3 kind of strategic assets in the game each benefit different kind of boost to you. Choose the ones suits you game style best. It would have been much better if you could just upgrade your weapons with points that you get by completing missions. Now you have to constantly check dmg/stats about weapons that drops during missions and you get like 10 new weapons in every mission. Useless weapons (about 90% of all drops) you just destroy to get small amount of experience points. All this dazzling doesn't bring anything good to the game and this mechanic should have been simplyfied. CGI cutscenes looks outdated and they should have done them with live action like in wh40k: Final liberation (1997). World of warhammer 40k is still well represented in cutscenes and especially in the opening cinematic. Endless slaughter what this game offers goes really repetitive after you have seen all the type of enemies and weapons there is to see. This game is without a doubt recomended if you are a warhammer fan, as you get so much more out of this game if you know the basic settings in warhammer 40k universe. The game kind of assume you are familiar with the lore and goes straight to the ""Bom bom bom"" -part. 10 - Perfect game 9 - Excelent game, best of the genre 7 - Average game, nothing really special 6 - Bad game, avoid 5 - Painful to play, completely waste of time 4 - Failed game, unpayable",True,False
"Do you like reading? As in, do you like any sort of literature? This game, or rather, the story in this game, is 100% a must for you to read and experience. World building at its finest, characters steadily develop and welcome you more and more into the world in Pyre. Won't say anything else about the story, because I'd like everyone to go into this as blind as I did, so let me just deal a final card about it: I have played and read a gazilion of stories in my steam and not steam library, and this one, will not be forgotten. Aesthetic and sound... it's a ""Supergiant"" game, it's common knowledge by now that their work is amazing in those departments. I like the vibrant colours in this one, and the music sets the mood perfectly, chill, with feeling, nothing wrong here, as per usual. Gameplay, it's a 3v3 football (soccer for the US peeps) with RPG elements, depending on your choice of team, you may fare really well, or just be confronted by an outright superior team. It depends on skill mostly, the AI is competent enough, and I'd recommend playing on the harder difficulties, so it provides a better challenge. The only fault I find with Pyre, is the lack of online multiplayer. Not being able to play with my online friends, knowing how fun it is to play with my ""local"" friends, makes it a frustrating missing aspect. Overall, story is excelent, gameplay is really fun, especially on harder difficulties, I highly reccomend this game with sale or no sale, although at this point, might as well wait for the discount to show up. Do you like to read? well, reader, this one's for you. You don't like to read ? Not my place to judge, but do give this one a try, it might surprise you after a while.",True,False
"There is no person I know that would not know of this game. Many gamers that I know regret every moment that they dont have this game. Its absoloutely brilliant, the requirements of the game are ridiculously low, the point of the game and gameplay is easy to understand for anyone who doesnt know of the game. However, this is a game that you would get bored of in about 2 hours of straight gameplay. Its impossible to stream it for more than 4h, because the game is so simple. All you do is walk and shoot. But indeed this is a trully great peace to play with your friends, you cannot play this game with more than 3 friends, so that sucks, but if there would be more players at the time it would be really boring and most of players would have nothing to do. Most of the rounds go fast forward and you do not get stuck at one point or another. The game has a minimum ammount of bugs or glitches, if there are any. There are multiple gamemodes and maps for you not to get bored within a day. But even knowing all the minuses, I still dont regret paying for this game.",True,False

"Think of Sharf as an experience, rather than a game. It's significance is in it's message and the author does a good enough job to immerse me and make me think about it and feel even if it is for just a few minutes (the ""game"" itself is ~10min long). You are in control of a girl named Christina, and she wanders the forest at night. The end really made an impact on me and I felt like I need to share this review. I won't say what is it about, so you can discover it for yourself. I liked the art and the sound effects (wind, leaves, creaking) and the overall atmosphere. The only issue is that the game doesn't have the exit button, so Esc key just crashes the game. Buy it to show support and spread the message, because it could happen to anyone.",True,False
"★ — 9/10 Takes a while to get started but the end is worth it. After going into Death Stranding completely blind having avoided every published content about it from the day it was released on the PS4 and not knowing what exactly I was getting myself into, I can only say that if you have absolutely no interest in a story-driven game, don't want to pay attention to what's going on, and watch all the cutscenes as well as listen to all the dialogue then I'm not sure if this game is for you.  In my opinion, the story is amazing but requires focus as well as patience because it takes a while before things get rolling, unfold, and take shape. This isn't a game that will spell out the entirety of the plot for you right away, it takes some effort and most of all patience to get there, and personally, I've enjoyed the ride and the end was definitely worth it. I know there are quite a number of people who seem to like to label Death Stranding as a ""walking simulator"" but I firmly believe that those people have either never played the game themselves, don't understand what the game really is about and what it has to offer, or the type of game it is is simply just not for them. Is there a lot of walking around in the game? Yes, there is. Is that what the entire game is about? No, it's not, far from it actually. Personally, I'm someone who genuinely dislikes fetching quests but for some reason, in Death Stranding, I never once felt bored, annoyed, or frustrated while taking trips back and forth between locations in order to fulfill deliveries and quest-related things to continue my journey through the story. It's also not just simply running from point A to B and back because the game throws various things your way that you have to adjust to. You have weight to manage, check what type of equipment you may need, plan a route to take, figure out the dangers you may run into, whether to go by foot or take a vehicle, and plenty of other factors to take into account for the best possible outcome and your trip to go as smooth as possible. Another reason why labeling Death Stranding as a ""walking simulator"" is beyond me is that walking simulators focus on environmental storytelling and exploration without an actual threat or enemies. There are plenty of threats in this game. From MULEs, human NPCs who want to steal your cargo, to areas filled with creatures called BTs which is short for beached things, to actual boss fights. Of course, when you start out, your main focus is on being stealthy because you don't get the means to fight back right away which could also be something that puts people off because it takes quite a while for things to unlock but I think this is a much better solution in this type of game than immediately throwing every possible equipment one could ask for at the player right from the start. You need to work and put in some effort to get something in return which, in my opinion, definitely isn't a bad thing at all. Gaining people's trust, not letting them down, and working towards a common goal is what unlocks possibilities and gets you closer and closer to the end of your journey. Visually and auditory, Death Stranding is absolutely stunning. The cutscenes are great and add a lot to the delivery of the story. The voice acting is really well done and the soundtrack is absolutely beautiful and pleasant to listen to. 50+ hours into the game and I'm still not tired of it. I haven't played a game in quite a while that kept my interest for this long, especially after already having finished the main story, I hardly ever go back into a game after I'm done with the main story. To me, Death Stranding looks amazing, sounds amazing, plays amazing, has amazing characters as well as an amazing story and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who really likes story-driven action games and has the patience to push past a slow start.",True,False

"Mordhau, A game of extreme aggravation and torment. When it comes to sword play games there is nothing better than this game especially in the medieval genre, wonderful customization and creativity, beautiful graphics, and awesome sound design. But it's player base and mechanics can get a bit heavy, players come and go with their toxicity but when it's there, man is it there. Followed by it's very heavy control scheme taking about half your keyboard and very awkward timing of swings and opponent reading, this game is the king of hard to learn, AND hard to master all at once. Vets coming from chivalry make this game a big up hill battle to climb when it comes to catching up, so do not expect this game to be a pick up and play kind of game, time and time again you will have your ass handed to on a silver platter until you get some form of understanding on how to defend yourself, but it's up to you when you learn it, sadly in this game you can't have everything taught to you in one night, you have to learn by playing countless of hours just to get somewhat efficient at dueling, and never mind fighting crowds of people. The learning curve is so deep you are gonna be scratching your head on what you did wrong half the time because it is not completely obvious of your mistakes, you are just gonna have to guess until you find the right one, which can take a day, or a year. Every attack is pretty much bindable but you may not have enough fingers or mental capacity to do all 6 directional swings and stabs, so I recommend using the 240 feature to do the swap work but it can be a bit unreliable at times, which is why I suggest using the 3rd person view for more spatial awareness as the swings depend on mouse movement which can make you disoriented in 1st person. The hitbox is super accurate and I mean crazy accurate, so it does not take much to miss an attack. (ping can play apart tho) All an all the game is very fun and a nice pass time, but the very hard mechanics and experienced players may ruin the enjoyment of the climb making you want to quit early, But unless you enjoy a challenge and want to over come this mountain go ahead and give it a shot. 7/10 and maybe even an 8 if the parry system was not so annoying and counted for everything on survival, I miss games using block as a form a defense and not just a stupid parry system, I can't stand games that do that. But if you are more of a casual gamer then I suggest you stay away from this and go buy something more chill, because there is nothing sweatier than Mordhau.",False,False

"After recieving my product through humble bundle, I was so excited to finally play this game. With the ammount of years that they have put into the game development; its rather disapointing to see whatg they've got done so far. It appears to me that the Devs have been working on the trailers and ""gameplay"" videos a bit too much instead of coding a propper game. No duh its a team of 5, no duh its the second day. I'm aloud to post a review, its my right. At the pace these devs are at right now, and with the small team they have; I don't expect much for maybe another year. Also if this was only for the backers, how did it get out to the public, it's their own fault and they have nobody but themselves to blame. It's going to be a long road for this game and maybe possibly in the future the game will change my perspective on how I feel about the game. Hopefully they can possibly expand their team to get things going quicker and more efficiently. They have a lot of publicity and potential, but need to kick themselves into gear.

Time to poke some holes in these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.) This combined with bad voice acting is agonizing Bad companion AI (they spout one liners when nothing is even in the same room, and start shooting at enemies through walls) All enemies feel exactly the same. Parts of the 3D models bodies are disproportionate (For example, A monster's head bigger than its torso) Death animations are long and drawn out Some... odd design choices (like the fact that the firs enemies you kill are possessed orphans) Linear level design in the first chapter (long boring corridors with no substance.

My 1080ti is idling away playing this, where if you would simply allow me to turn up LOD/Render distance I would have had a much better experience.

If this is an example of a very positive game, Pillars of Eternity 1 and 2 must be a masterpiece.

If you watch a youtube video critiquing this game, you'll see massive dislikes from the same people. I gave this game a chance even though I did not like how Larian just ignored all the fans of the first two Baldur's Gate games and how this game mechanics are just copied and pasted from the Divinity games.  For those people who say that the turn-based combat and the game as a whole resembles DnD tabletop more than the first Baldur's Gate games, you're right but this is a pc game series that came out two decades ago. Baldur's Gate 3 should be more similar to the first two Baldur's Gate games as this is an established series at this point.  Aside from the repetitive complaints from Baldur's Gate fans like myself, I still won't recommend this game just yet because the number of bugs in a single 3-4 hour session will make you want to kill yourself. There are textures that never load, crashes, black screens which forces you to restart the game, etc. The story itself is alright so far but nothing spectacular. I find myself going through the motions to get to the end rather than wanting to know more about this world. If this was a game by Ubisoft, Electronic Arts, or Blizzard, people would be all over this game trashing this game to hell, but since it's made by Larian, fanboys give all kinds of excuses and defend this game from anyone and everyone, especially Baldur's Gate fans. You probably already have this game if you like Larian. I just wanted to throw my two cents in the reviews section.",False,True

"The game keeps crashing after saving manual/autosave in Whitechappel after dialogue with a doctor about a particular scalpel. I've tried to update Nvidia drivers and different video settings, playing in windowed mode keeping only 2 saves, as some players suggested on the forum but nothing helped, A lot of people experiencing this particular problem with all of Sherlock Holmes games from Grogwares save for a few early games in the series. Something isn't right with the game engine and in-game saving system! Unfortunately, It seems as if the guys from Frogwares don't give a damn about this whole situation!! I am so disappointed because this game definitely has a potential ..   . I don't recommend to buy games from Frogwares because you might as well experience this issue thus you'll be unable to finish any of them.  I've found a solution! I was playing in windowed mode and keeping only two save files. I've definitely tweaked something else but I don't remember what exactly. Apart from this, the game's really good. Interesting and sometimes quite challenging puzzles Sadly, the story is quite trivial and hardly engaging. Oh, often puzzles are repetitive. For example, many characters in the game have either boxes or cases with codes or some tricky mechanisms you have to decipher or solve in order to open them.

"Sadly, this seems to be an attempt at a retro shooter made by people who watched gameplay videos of the classics, but didn't play them (or played them and somehow got the wrong idea?) The two main weapons I've used so far feel way too underpowered (shotgun has trouble dealing with Imps, for instance) and the enemies all look too similar. This is also an issue with the rest of the game's overall look as well, since it seems like they went with a Hell theme that's basically ""hey, Hell is red-ish"" Level design is also a snoozefest so far, while we are at it. The music is serviceable, and the voice actor is clearly doing his best, but I can't help but feel dumb when he proclaims his love for the Church of the Triple Barreled Shotgun, while at the same time never having enough ammo to fire it, and when he does, it's a water pistol. So far, the game is a complete disappointment, with the only thing I like being the movement speed. I hope it improves, but I'm not so sure about the chances of that happening. I think I'm either going to replay the original Doom, or maybe DUSK or Amid Evil, those two are genuine throwback shooters that don't just try to copy the visuals, but actually improve upon the gameplay of the classics.",False,False

let me start with the fps it was unbearable and even wen i put it on medium it didn't look acceptable. The gameplay was not good because the servers are overrun with clans and factions. so for me (a new player that had no experience with the game) it was very hard to adapt to the game. the spawns were not good also as i once spawned in a snake pit that was level 90... with no weapons. The game engine looks like a rip off of some shooter game. and the hud was like a 10 year old program it. and finally they are releasing dlcs and the game is a Early Access game... for me it was a bad experience thats why im giving it a bad review.,False,True
"Much like the FIFA series has spent a majority of the last decade focusing on their Ultimate Team pay to win mode, PES development has left everything else than the myClub mode a relatively barren wasteland. It's been years since the traditional manager career mode Master League has seen substantial changes, and playing against the PES AI is not enjoyable to begin with. Gone are the days when different opponents had fairly unique playstyles; nowadays the only noteworthy differentiation regarding the AI is how extremely they cheat on the higher difficulty levels, with your own players becoming sluggish lemmings with slower and delayed animations in the name of a ""challenge"". As the myClub mode is available for free a couple months after each PES launch in the form of  , there's no compelling reason to pay even more (considering how much real money a bunch of viable players will cost you) just to play it a bit earlier. In 2019 the only thing one missed out by playing the Lite version are some particularly overpowered pay to win players that were only available in the months before the F2P launch (and, technically, a hilarious manager with four strikers). As for the online gameplay, it's most enjoyable playing against a friend of similar skill level on the same continent, given both are happy to lose matches to the other. The other modes are plagued by cheaters, gruesome cross-continental input delay, and absurd scripting/momentum (as seen in FIFA titles) that become very frustrating for any matches you do take seriously. Unfortunately Konami disabled the progression features that are core to myClub for matches against opponents of your choice. I understand that boosting is a concern otherwise, but in a game where a lot of the community grind out thousands of simulated matches (COM v COM) to slowly gain ingame currency, it's a rather absurd argument. On the positive side, because the game has a tiny playerbase, during off-peak hours it's very easy to get matchmade against a friend in ranked mode using moderate team strength. Coincidentally the game is also a lot more fun if one avoids using the best players — with weaker teams there is a bigger variety of valid tactics and players. Using two, three or four star teams is where the game is the most fun. It's still completely pay to win, and that matches against friends as well as coop matches lack progression features really brings it down.",False,False

"okay so, im gonna be realistic here. trove is a fun, interesting and just incredible game however, the flaws that come with it are WAY to hard to ignore, first of all it is highly based on pay to win and you have to spend  stupid amounts of money or grind for weeks on end just to do something. For example the latest update with the vanguardian made it so you can't unlock it with a class token and you either have to farm/grind to get it or pay money completely rendering class tokens (aqquired from buying packs) useles. The servers are absoloute piles of ♥♥♥♥ you will lag a ton , not do damage or be randomly teleported and its a shame as it was such a good game back in the day when it was released but now trion worlds have made it near to impossible for new players to even play, it is extemely hard to get new classes without paying up so sadly im gonna have to give this a thumbs down until trion worlds get their ♥♥♥♥ together",False,False

"Etherlords II feels like a game lost in what it's predecessor could have been, and what it wants to be.  It strives to give the same sense of battle as the previous game: turn based card battles in the same vein as Magic the Gathering.  However, it has taken all jeopardy out of those battles.  Normally, for me this would not be a bad thing, and indeed it is helpful, in that the game is formated much more like and RPG, like a story.  So each battle gives much needed XP and strategy information for further battles, and if one tactic doesn't work, another might. This would all work wonderfully, but for the fact that the story you gain is so scant, and the game primarily turns into a map crawl where you guess and pick and choose at which creatures are the best to pick this time.  If the game made the battles interesting, it would be one thing, but as a person who finds chess ultimately dull, this game made me horribly bored.  Plus there was no risk; you could just ""try again"" at any battle, having lost nothing, so the game turns into an exercise not really in strategy per se, so much as a guessing and recording game for each of the story lines, where you figure out what is effective through tedious trial and error, then reenact it on any higher level monster of the same type with the same types of creatures. The lack of investment this wrought, for me made the story boring, the battles tedious and the tactics canned.  With the sound and the graphics obviously salvaged from it's predecessor, this is barely two steps up the ladder from the first game, which was in all honesty more difficult and with a higher risk, but also much too punishing.  This sequel makes the opposite mistake, where there are no stakes, no worry, and the only thing this serves to do is waste the player's time trying to determine the best way to play, or to engender cheating using anything from guides to actual codes in an attempt to grasp the story. I cannot in good faith recommend this game.",False,False

"I feel awful writing a negative review about this game, but it's just overall an unpleasant experience. Controls are absolutely horrendous. Moving anywhere feels like iceskating on a bannana peel. With conventional controls, this could be recoverable, but the mouse steering makes it a real struggled to aim anywhere at all. Partially due to the controls, I ended up with pretty severe motion sickness from this. The jittering combined with poor controls, and the overall nature of the game's style makes it unpleasant. I don't normally get motion sick, but this was definitely an horrendous experience. There's not too much else to say about the game. The soundtrack is pretty nice if you're into the genre, and the vaporwave aesthetics can be pleasant in places. The world design is a redeeming feature, and the level is fun to explore. It's unique, but also repetitive at the same time. It's difficult to properly enjoy the world with the bad controls though. There isn't much of a story to the game from what I can tell. It's a shame, since Awkward Dimensions Redux had a pretty amazing story experience and this game just lacks that. I really wish that I could recommend this game. But I can't.",False,False

To get these vast amounts of visuals processed on my humble GTX 980 Ti... never would have thought. Granted, I get the occasional 1-2minutes of freezes before some larger portion of the map gets loaded in, so there's a lot of optimization to be done.

Pros; 1_) Is a good game to gather friends around and have some fun time with Can't really find any other good changes in comparison to counter-strike source.It's got this hype about it only because it was well advertised and people get a hardon for weapon skins for whatever reason. Reasons why you should not buy this game: Cons; 1_) It's basically counter-strike:source with broken mechanics and cosmetics (You can customize CS:S for free anyway using mods) 2_) Hit detection is as bad as it gets.There are a ton of videos with a shot being a hit but it is not registered.    3_) 64 Tick rate in competitive servers.Really valve?

People think they can prove their FPS skill by playing this game to get a higher rank.I think otherwise even though I'm one of those to carry the team, most of the time 1st on the scoreboard, I think ranking is about; 1_) Servers got 64 tick rate, anyone with medium-high ping are considered easy targets, since tick rate effects low ping people the least. 2_) Your rank is about how much you play it.You can just join ranked, get a good team and have them carry you to victory, then you'll get a better rank without effort",False,False

"This game had SO much potential. It's a lot of fun exploring space, finding new planets, species and materials, crafting new things here and there. But that's about everything you do in the game. It's fun for a couple of hours, then it gets repetitive and boring. Not worth the 60 euros.",False,False
"--- --- +Has fantastic potential with the home base and possible customization +Good graphics +Well polished considering how far into development it is --- --- +Super long queues with no bots to fill in so games generally have 2-4 players at a time +Paid game with in game purchases (cosmetic only) +Very limited current customization options --- --- RAMS is a Battle Royale game with a twist. You start with a fully fledged base of operations! With good graphics and RPG elements, RAMS has a TON of potential. --- --- : Pretty straight forward, it's hard to mess with an fps set up. Still, the hand to hand combat seems to be a bit funky with hits not landing when they should and some hits landing when they shouldn't. : The player starts the match on a train moving through the landscape where most battle royale's will have you in the air, giving you a more 3 dimensional approach to your original spawn, where the train is a 2 dimensional, leaving it easy for players to see when another player gets off the train and able to hunt them down quickly. Furthermore, you start matches with weapons, which, once again, wouldn't be a problem if the spawn system was a bit different. In it's current state, it's too easy to hop off the train right after someone else and gank other players making the already short games far shorter when there's only two people. : Pretty solid. After the match is done you get a good amount of money so you can buy more weapons and ammo.  I'm sure eventually customization options will allow you to buy cosmetics for your base. --- --- :  Good graphics. I haven't seen much of the environment because of previously mentioned spawn camping and games with only 2-4 players.  : Basic, however it seems that in the future there will be customization, but as of right now there's nothing special to note, good or bad. : Crouching is too fast and feels unnatural, when you jump your arms stretch straight in front of you, other than that everything seems a bit clunky but otherwise fine. : Straight forward, your general fps interface in matches but what I really like is how your home base acts as the main menu with a straight forward 'e' to activate and 'alt' to allow cursor to select menus. --- --- : The only bug I saw was while waiting in the lobby for a game random player models would kind of pop in on the spawn point. Nothing that breaks the game as far as I saw. : Solid performance, no lag on my end. However, without a full match of players to test the performance of the game you'll have to take this with a grain of salt. --- --- : Has potential in the future if the devs can attract a larger player base. : I would certainly not be happy paying 12$ for this. I frown upon non free to play games that have any sort of system where you can buy in game currency. On top of that, the game is currently unable to be completely experienced without the ability to play a full match.  The dev's should honestly think of making this a free to play title and have more in game items to purchase such as early development donation skins for weapons and players. --- --- There's a base of a game here, but no real gameplay in sight. No one is going to pay for this in it's current state if they see the reviews first. There's no one playing and if you get lucky enough to get into a match or two, it's only going to be against a couple players.  However, if the devs take my advice and make the game free to play with in game purchases, I feel that the player base would grow quickly and make the game a bit more worth playing.  Until then, I feel that this game is will not succeed on the current market, it simply doesn't have enough to offer that other, popular games already offer for free. In case the devs do take my advice and make this free to play, giving those that purchased it some sort of compensation, I'll keep this game on my radar and re-review it in the future. Keep up the good work guys, this game has a lot of potential and I'm excited to see where it goes. --- --- 		CPU 			Intel Core i5 @ 3.60GHz 		RAM 			16.0GB Dual-Channel Unknown @ 1066MHz (15-15-15-36) 		Graphics 			4095MB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 (EVGA) I recieved the game for free for review purposes",False,True

"Full rant:  This is a placeholder recommendation for now, I will eventually post a more detailed and precise review about the game itself. Needed to make this placeholder review just to inform everyone not to buy this game until Bugbear cleans up their act. It's unfortunate that I have to do this, but I can't just sit here without exposing Bugbear for their shady practices that have been haunting the game's development. After many years, the game is still an unfinished mess, Digital Deluxe backers still don't have their perks and now... they made a new game and they are already developing consoles versions of Wreckfest without finishing the PC version first. It's clear that they are squeezing as much money as they can right now, so they blatantly screw their customers without giving a rat's butt about their reputation. The new game they made, is free for people who backed Wreckfest on their site. YET, people like me who bought the game on Steam for the same price, don't get the new game for free. There's no way, anyone in this planet can think this is fair. They don't care about their Steam customers, otherwise we would get the same perks. I've had enough with Bugbear and I certainly won't buy anything else from them unless they clean up their act. If you're reading this and you still don't own the game, wait until the moment they say the game is complete. I really want to know if they have the guts to call this complete in early 2017 (which is the date that's being rumoured right now) despite having at least one more year of work for this game to be truthfully complete. Do NOT defend Bugbear's evil practices, this is what's ruining gaming nowadays.",False,True

"Highly modular and customizable experience, similar in spirit to NWN, but the lack of regulation, or of a proper rating system results in a lot of confusion. The game is a blank slate where you have to use pre-built asset packages to create any entertainment yourself or most commonly, rely on the community to deliver entertainment for you. With Steam Workshop integration the community has created all kinds of different modules with custom assets and game modes. However, as a game that is kept alive by its community it also suffers because of it. Since there is no regulation, it's common to load up a module and have to sit through close to an hour of loading screens as the game is downloading not only the custom assets of the said module, but also the custom player models of those on the server. Most common of the said assets and custom player models may include Radical Islamic, Far-right, Racist, Pedophilic and Hentai themed content.",False,False

I didn't even play the game for free however it's a ridiculous change that's been met with nothing but backlash but they don't care, they just want your money.",False,False
"If I had to recommend this to someone curious about what PSO2 NA has to offer, I'd say nope. Straight up, the experience is a gambling addiction. I haven't played JP but I know the western release is a rushed downgrade of it, there's not really an endgame right now. PSO2 is an 8 year old game so many of the features will seem outdated. There are in game tutorials but they're vague, many will leave you wondering  . Some tutorials imply that a mechanic is useful and they won't elaborate on it at all so you can screw up your progression later.  * *I really can't say anything other than what everyone else will tell you. All you can do is search for online resources.  Anyways, I want to give you a scenario. Imagine trading being locked by a paywall. Yup, you connected all the dots. This is where I rant about  . There's a ton of customisation, items ect. It's more of a curse than a blessing, thanks to the classic 'we create a problem, you solve it with your money' business strategy. While it is optional to pay for the illusion of convenience, the tactics for luring people into handing over their wallet is akin to a mobile game. Regardless of you paying or not, you'll be screwed over by the damn fine print.  Extended storage? Subscription passes. Trading? Premium subscription or personal shop passes. Cosmetics? Usually bound to 1 character so you buy multiple passes of the same thing. Crafting? Oh yeah, you'll want a personal quarters pass for that. SG items? Can't be traded despite paying for it or taking the time to earn it. AC scratch is a gacha and percentages are a lie as long as you have RNG. As other people have said, this game is freemium and it should have been marketed as that instead of attempting to introduce new players to a disappointment. I've been enjoying playing the lackluster version of PSO2 and I have no clear reason for it other than somehow, finding it fun to play. Phashion is probably the only thing you'd care about long term. You'll be consumed by a vicious cycle of grinding for soon to be outdated equipment, praying to RNGesus, blacklisting meseta bots and trying to become your ultimate waifu.",False,False

"Richard was a simple minded boy. As a kid, he liked to play video games, he liked that feeling of empowerment when he shot enemies left and right in the latest Call of Duty. He liked to have fun. Life was simple. Then Richard discovered achievements on Steam and his life took a turn for the worse. Now his games had this phallic bar below their titles, and as boys do he wanted it to be as long as possible. But it was often hard to get it fully erect, with no achievement left undone. All he wanted from video games was fun. Life was already challenging enough with a name like Richard after all. This changed some months ago though. Richard discovered that more and more cheap games appeared on Steam that featured a massive amount of achievements. And best of all, achievements you got for basically doing nothing at all! True, those games were not good or fun, but gaming had ceased to be about fun for Richard long ago. He wanted those numbers, he wanted them so badly. And now he could have them, more than he ever dreamed of, with little to no effort! In some of those games all he had to do was press a single key over and over again. Heck, not even press it manually, he just went out into his parents' garden and fetched a stone which he placed on the keyboard. At one time he even had a wet dream about that stone, after a fulfilling day of thousands of new achievements. Then Richard came across Drive-By Hero. More than 5000 achievements made him instantly buy it. And it was even a shooter! He used to like those. Of course the game was utter trash, cheap assets lazily cobbled together, the gun sounded like some stapler gone on a rampage, the gameplay was even worse than he expected. Three levels, one boss. The introductory message sounded like the dev had voice-recorded it himself with a cheap webcam. But he had stopped caring about things like that by now. He just wanted those achievements. So Richard played. His trusty stone wouldn't do for this though: every time he died, he had to press the mouse button to start firing again. He had already played for hours and still was only halfway through firing all those bullets. While he stared and mindlessly shot at the hordes of zombies approaching him, his mind entered a zen like dream state. He remembered those good shooters, the fun he had. After a while, with nothing else to do, he even began questioning the game's logic, how zombies running into his tank could cause him damage, or why he kept staring in the same direction although his tank made a turn. He moved the crosshairs up and tried firing at the full moon instead, to not have to look at the barren monochrome areas or the cheap zombies anymore, but the crosshairs stopped just a few pixels below the moon, unable to ever reach it, and he died too quickly that way as well. Richard fired away at those zombies for what was beginning to feel like an eternity. The image of the approaching hoardes of the undead dug deep into that simple brain of his. Once in a while, a tear would roll out of his unblinking eyes. Ever so slowly his mood would get worse and worse. What was he doing with his life? After a while the zombies and he became one in Richard's mind. Finally, his face expressionless, he stood up, grabbed that heavy, trusty stone and went into his parents' garden once more. It was night time by now, and as chance would have it, a full moon was up, forever unreachable in that beautiful, clear night sky. He slowly, mechanically got down on his knees and raised the stone above his head. With force he brought it down, time and time again. He fastened his grip in determination as the stone got slippery from his own blood. Then the deed was done. The pain was over. As his consciousness faded into the void between the stars, he was finally at peace. This is Richard's story. Don't let it be yours.",False,True

"There's too much positive reviews to not call it an organized campaign. The game has been made in Unity and I bet most of the models have been lifted from the unity asset store. Game can be completed in less than 15 minutes. It has enemies that are blind and won't hit you unless you choose to not kill them and just run past them. I was hit twice in my 2 minutes long pacifist sprint to the end boss. This game has only one level and it's extremely short, it has intersection of two streets in the middle of a city and a short, pointless train road that leads to the city from the house of a protagonist. There are no health pickups, no ammo pickups, no weapon pickups, you start the game with AK47 with 700 bullets and a rocket launcher with 100 rockets and it will suffice till the end. Main boss has a shotgun and he actually can aim, but you can easily outrun him or just jump on the building. Somewhere in the 2/3rd of his lifebar you'll race his friend (that will crash on the crossroads) and after that you'll fight him again. The End. The couple of screenshots in the game present all variety that can be seen in the game, so there's really nothing to see. One ladder that can be seen isn't functional, also most of the level geometry is simplified, meaning you won't be able to enter most building. Despite that you can still get out of bounds and run to the edge of the map, or bug the game out.  I am aware that this is a meme game but even meme games should have some content. Check VCB Why CIty for comparison, also made in unity by russian devs but with at least some content. This is just lousy. I'm pretty sure it's a student's project and the dev thought that a passing grade is just enough for commercial release.",False,False

"EDIT 2 : After the Iceborne update, Performance issues are back. I re-edited my review. Seems that Capcom achieved to create a ""regressive Update"" (yeah it's a contradiction, right?). EDIT : After the last patch, seems there are no more connection issues. So I edited my review. Big fan of Monster Hunter series, i was waiting for this PC version for a long time. Now that I have it I can say that for the most part it lived up to my expectations, they added many features that I hoped for. - Good variety of monsters to hunt: old as much as new ones (some are a dissapointment but    hey, it's my opinion). - The maps are gorgeous, and dynamic : you can use the field to your advantage. - Since the Online mode works fine, plenty of hunters to play with.   Good feature : your lobby can support up to 16 players, helps alot if you have more than 3    friends (old games were limited to 4) playing with you. - Iceborne is a good expansion, lots of new monsters to hunt (plus those yet to come) - The maps are bigger wider - The new featured tool Clutch claw is a bit too much, though it adds some flashy moves. The game at it's core is good but UNFORTUNATELY, and I think all those months of delay was alot of wait for a mere port with big performance issues:    - Alt-Tab when the game runs in the Fullscreen mode causes a crash...    - The game is even more taxing on your system than it used to be (90-99% of CPU/GPU usage, and I tried many ""fixes"") I recommended the game since 11Nov 2018, but as it is now I DON'T RECOMMEND buying it!",False,False

"Artillerists is like a really bad, unbalanced version of the old boardgame Battleship, which has been re-created as a video game quite a few times and much better than this. This is a complete guessing game, at least to the extent that I have played it. You can earn money to spend in an upgrade shop (the Artillery, where you buy ""abilities""), but you have to grind out guessing games to earn the money.  Whereas this is obviously a Battleship style game (obvious even before you purchase the game), what you don't know ahead of time is how unbalanced it is. By the third mission of the main campaign, you have 2 mortars in a 6x6 grid. The mortars take up one block each, so you can only take 2 hits and then you lose. The AI has more than 6 blocks of units in a 6x6 grid, and the game gives you no idea how many the AI has at the beginning of each mission. I haven't made it past the third mission of the main campaign (as of this review) because this is just a pitiful waste of my time when I could be watching paint dry instead. The AI also has ""abilities"" to hit multiple blocks, whereas you are stuck with grinding to buy lesser abilities early in the game, and they are really expensive and underpowered, particularly when the AI has some ♥♥♥♥ that can hit like 5 blocks at once as well as at least one airstrike (which hits 2 blocks) by this third mission.  You can use radar and airstrike abilities if you have purchased them at this point, but they are very expensive. When I say expensive I mean you will grind out clicking on grids trying to win missions in order to gain money. There are side-missions in which you can gain money, but the clicking and guessing is just horribly boring. In the game Battleship it's essentially the same, except you know what you're up against (the same units as you have, and there is a little more fun to the minimal planning and some strategy involved even though it amounts to guessing). This is just a poorly thought out game. Nobody likes an unbalanced guessing-game. There are people that pop up with irritating dialog as well, which just makes it even more annoying because that makes more clicks to grind out.  Count this as an extremely negative review. HUGE thumbs down!",False,False
"TLDR: If you expect a Sanctum-styled game,look elsewhere. If you are looking for a fun defense shooter to play with friends, go ahead.  This game's art direction looks and feels amazing, but if you expect the game to require deep strategy in the tower builder phase, don't expect too much. I bought this game expecting something closer to Sanctum 2 which pushed both the tower defense and shooter parts further. This wasn't really it and was kinda disappointed but kept playing since it seemed like I had a misconcetion about the game's intents in mind. The game seem to mostly revolve around casual multiplayer game with friends, which isn't a bad thing in itself, and some good old run and gun with a few traps you can set around the map. Those traps are mostly to buy you time when you are looking elsewhere, there's no crazy combos you'd expect from a Tower Defense game. It feels much more like a pillow fort than anything else, really. If you want to play this game, the higher difficulties will require more team coordination than strategy, which can be annoying when playing solo. I didn't really find what I wanted in this game, but if you like playing any kind of player vs AI multiplayer shooter, this game is made for you. Edit: Rewrote the review as I didn't feel like it conveyed my feelings about the game the right way. This game's amazing even if isn't right up my alley.",False,False

"Pros: + Good selection of rally cars, both classic and newer cars. Although I miss some classics such as the Lancia 037 and the Opel Manta 400. + Stages are interesting and challenging. Not as good as WRC 7 and Dirt Rally though, but it beats Dirt 4's autogenerated bland stages. + Physics in general are OK. The game is more sim than arcade, which is good. + Very good and varied career mode. + 'Loeb experience' mode is nice. + Cars have their official livery. You can also make your own if you want. + Interesting historical info about the cars. Cons: - Very weak sound. I think this is the worst thing about this game. - Graphics are bad. A game like Dirt 3 has actually better graphics and that game is 5 years older than this. - Can't clean the windshield, which gets annoying. I recommend the bonnet cam instead of cockpit because of this. - Cars flip too easily. Can be very annoying at times. - Inconsistent AI. Sometimes you can beat them by 20 seconds on the hardest difficulty. Next stage you might lose by 20 seconds. Although most Rally games seem to have this problem more or less. - MP is pretty much dead afaik. - No community events like Dirt Rally, Dirt 4 and Wrc 7 have. - Co-driver is sometimes way off. For example: when he says right 2, it can sometimes be a hairpin.  - Sometimes the co-driver calls come very late (even if you have it on the 'very early' setting). That's a problem in France when you're driving a fast car with weak brakes like the Lancia Delta S4 and there is no time to brake. I guess that's what the rewind future is for. :) I don't recommend paying full price for this (29.99€) considering how many problems this game has. However, I bought the special edition for about 10€ and I think it's a decent game for that price. This game is enjoyable from time to time when I get bored of other rally games such as Dirt Rally and WRC 7. In conclusion: Full price: not recommended. If you pick this up on a sale: recommended.",False,False

"this review is for phalax the only person i have seen team kill DONT PLAY THIS GAME if any one ells reads this(I only read bad reviews) then Definity play the game i got it 100% reduced and was like why not try it (I did read what others are saying negative and they suck for free you get soviet campaign. it was fun until that bit in red alert type games were you don’t get a base and have just a few troops to do a mission,,,,,, well I gave it 2 try’s and was like…… im to old for this and just played online as soviets.  This is not a freemium game the soviets are just as good as other nations you  have to perchas ) i ended up buying the American expansion with $$$$$ it was that good of a game the US expansion online they start with a base but have expensive upgrades to unlock the tanks so it’s the same as soviets just different men fun but and worth it This game is definitely worth real $$$$  I would pay for the game I got for free in hind sight  its like red alert but not silly and the online play is the best  im an older Australian gamer and don’t like playing online vs people (they drop me so fast)and ping makes them complain but this has no ping problems.   This is team play vs computer online and its hell fun, there is lots of tactics like i don’t go for tanks so much i work on anti tank and mortar support and back up team mates  i would say i wish this game was more like world of tanks a bit with clan wars  there is NO SOCIAL atmosphere in this its not that people are mean there is no talking.   In game its hard to see the chat box and i have not heard any mics  In chat rooms its full of people talking other languages than English and they don’t talk much at all  i bet there are clans with team speak this game would be so good for that so for any person other than phalax get this game get a mic look me up my profile is not privet we will join some team speak clan and drink beer and get smashed by computer players on expert :D",False,False

"Where to start with this game. There is so much wrong with it. From the developers to the foul community. Let me start with the community, because this is whom you're going to interact most with. It is filled with  ,   and others. I had the unfortunate experience of walking into a condo filled with watersports. The owner was a   who proceeded to inform me about how she sells marijuana in her own neighbourhood. She then told me that because she forgot to UV ray her product one time - she urinated on it instead and sold it to customers unknowingly, who reportedly liked that special produce batch. She then does this with her partner.  This isn't uncommon for this game. 99% of the houses will be littered with furry and water sports. This community is not safe. It is not functional. Most of the player base have something very much wrong with them - from being suicidal to just down right weird. The developers don't care about it either. I informed them about some condo that had hints of child porn in it. They chat banned me instead of looking into it. Way to silence whistle blowers. My friend also got channed banned but for entirely different circumstances. Another friend of mine doesn't play this game anymore because the community is so, so weird.  Moving on to the developers, ah the developers. Cut from the same cloth as the player base.  They don't know what they are doing with the game. It's poorly made and even though they have a road map, it makes it ten fold worse that they can't stick to it as an early access game. So, in conclusion. If you're a furry, or you are into animal watersports on humans and love to see child porn littered around condos - then this is the game for you. BTW, if you are wondering why I got this game? I purchased it for the golf mini game. I found out about the other stuff when I visited the public lobbies and condos.",False,True

"Short review opening: I was disported big time from these game as a single play/VS player I used to play Tekken back in 1,2,3 and love the game back then, how you got to play each character and see a small story of them and now i am here with Tekken 7 that feels like they did not try as much, that they wanted you to just go multiplayer While playing the AI was clearly not trying, had times where i basically did something simple like stand in place, so they attack the air, or worst of the worst a bonus boss that was just cheap, i mean when you are laying on the ground, and all he dose is keep shorting a far range attack that cant attack you on the floor over and over again basically spamming that attack it dose not feel challenging it feels just annoying Or when you need to fight with 1/4 of the heal vs a boss that heals every second a little while you fight (and is blocking your attacks even while his attacking) Adding to that the Tea Break mode (AKA Rage Art) that was also in Injustice: god among us it just dose not feel fun when you winning and just as you come to give a punch time freeze and your foe lunches a Rage Art attack that you cant avoid or deny then, and takes around 1/4 of your HP But hey i don't play that many fighting games over all, but these just feels to me like they want you to play multiplayer, and trying to improve the game, that was pretty good as it was",False,False

While the graphics is pretty nice, there are few enemies that look a lot worse than the rest of the game.

"Horny boys wet dream. Besides that this game have bad game designs, camera in tight spots is just obnoxious, your turtorial is click punch to punch and kick to kick then they leave u with like 30 combo list and that's it, it isn't going to help anyone get into the game. Then they show you on basic enemies ""when it glows you dodge then times slows"" this is the only like 2 sec you can use to even try to do combos, becouse in this game you need after every atack just hold this button to stay still and shot/do something else, when every enemy besides starting will just ♥♥♥♥ you up then and without it you don't do any dmg. Then next enemies doesn't have ""glowing attacks"" and are even more obnoxiouse than camera becouse u have no way to tell what they are doing and you get kicked even without seeing this THEN even after you stunlock enemies and want to do something they starts to say NOPE and kick your ass for no reason, that's even worse than everything else. (One extra sin is that even if you dodge correctly most of the time you get sound for slow time, but it doesn't slow and it piss you off even more) You either plays street fighters and will get this combos or you don't and it's just impossible becouse u don't even have any place to train. And it doesn't help that ""style"" meter in this game is just bad for everyone start, you get panalized for everything, becouse if u get hit you have - points and this points doesn't even care if u spam same attack, it just get record of how many times you attacked. 2/10 this game is VERY BAD if you don't play teken/SF/etc and isn't a horny tenage boy that just wants to have camera shots on tits and ass and nearly naked main char.

"Pigmentum is a very basic reaction based game. To call it ""minimalist"", as the store description says, is both euphemistic as well as an overstatement. It's barebones: a block has to pass through blue, red and green bars while matching their colours and you can switch the colour of the block by clicking on the according buttons. And that's it. I'll give it that is is responsive, but the buttons are so widely apart that you have to both focus on the main screen as well as them. Simply allowing keyboard prompts would have improved this a lot. The game offers an optional retro filter, you can turn off the two different sound effects and set it to fullscreen. None of these options are saved, but you'll likely never touch the game a second time, since the gameplay doesn't offer much at all and the achievements can be completed within minutes. Even for a free mobile game this would be considered overly simple. Heck, even compared to the most basic of Atari 2600 games it's lacking. This is something people just learning how to code will be able to cobble together after their first few minutes to hours, not kidding. If it's part of a bundle, it's okay to kill a few minutes I'd say. Otherwise play just about any other game, don't spend money on this.",False,False

This new update ""Waking the Tiger"" has entirely ruined the game for me, the army managment system has become headache inducing, Field Marshalls are now just a hastle to use and the supposed AI fixed have made either your defence so utterly terrible that you just want to die or make the hostiles defence laughably disorganized making invasion with simple infantry entirely possible. The new stability and war support systems too have made the game just that much more of a hastle, sure they add some ""realism"" to the game by adding a political layer to it, but no one plays this game to appease the countries people and justify wars, no we play to kick some arse and dominate the planet (I.E Europe). Another great example of a botched mechanic would have to be the new mobilizing forces addition, which makes making an army take far longer than it needs to be, especially if you're attempting to create a massive defence force in preperation for a multiple front war. All in all this game was good, but it is not anymore, unwanted and poorly executed mechanics mixed with a large learning curve and a annoying amount of micro managment have made this game even more broken than it has been for months, I wish I could say that if you look past the flaws it's worth playing, but honestly I can not and will not say that to any poor soul looking to buy this game.",False,False
After playing a few rounds and really hard trying you get really quick into the game the controls and everything is very simple too.

I hoped for a good game in this one i hope to find a lobby where arent any hackers or crybabies so far  The thing in Contagion is there are many game modes which i will try but when survivors should kill each other theres a high chance that hackers will be involved there.

In all honesty this game has disappointed me. For me personally Saints Row is a game of over the top ridiculous nonsense (at least in recent additions to the series) and this game is just not there.  Gat out of hell's plot is weak. The game feels like for of a Dlc such as how the saints saved Christmas in IV or Trouble with clones in the 3rd. I'll give you a list of the things I've liked and not Pro's • Good upgrades on abilities  • You get to play as Johnny Gat (!!!) • See some old characters from the series • The weapons you get are pretty awesome (though not a patch on the dubstep gun from IV) Con's • Annoying characters!!! (Can't stand the devils daughter) • Lack of character from the main crew - you only see characters such as Pierce and Shaundi at the start and end) • All the side quests are annoying or boring - there wasn't a single one I liked • The wings are hard to control • The map is quite boring • THE VEHICLES - can't save any and they all look awful • No music - like cmon really? • The game is so short - like who is going to get the 40hours+ achievement when the campaign takes 8 hours to complete  I love the saints row series! But this game just doesn't fit with the general theme. Hope it doesn't look like I'm complaining but is my honest opinion of the game. Disappointed as this game was the most expensive one I bought in the series and it was the worst (imo),False,False

"""OMG a negative CS:GO review, this guy must be on LSD"" Yeah, its a negative review and here´s way: With about 1k hrs of game and LE as the highest rank achived i have to say, its really sad but i just can´t thumb up this review ! The game itself isn´t bad ! Good graphics, many game modes and a pretty good gameplay (the only issue i would say are the spawns in deathmatch mode) ! But we can´t judge a game only by good graphics and performance and what rly ruins this game is people, his community ! 1. CHEATERS Its sad to see a game with so much competitive potential full of hackers ! I can´t play 1 single competitive without finding a ♥♥♥*ing cheater ! The point is, every game has cheaters, but in a normal game, they get banned, but ofc we talking about the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ CS:GO where banning accounts giving the opurtunity to cheaters to create another accounts and make steam profit even more is more important than providing players the best gameplay possible. What really disgusts me is seeing professional players geting VACban, it only shows up how terrible Valve is  i mean.... if they take so long to catch a pro with cheats imagine just a random player, this only reflects how bad and primitive Vac security systems are ! VAC should improve in 10000% their security systems ! Cheaty twa*s make this game unplayable (mainly in the weekend when daddys and mommys allow their kids to play) Every night i pray "" Pls VAC, start ban the IP adress and not just the account"" but they just don´t.  You want solutions ? Ban the IP adress for a couple months, if the ♥♥♥ keeps hacking ban for 6 months, if he hacks a 3rd time ban him for a year. I can ensure you people would grow some balls and start playing legit, but ofc, once again, this wouldn´t be proffitable for Gaben... so they just don´t do it :) ""Oh NB, you are so ignorant, what about Prime accounts?"" Prime Matchmaking ? In other others ""The biggest bull*hit i ever seen"" In matter of fact, i played about 20 compt. since i joined prime and i find even more cheaters than in normal matchmaking. And just to make you see how awful the situation is you now can even find cheaters in casual and deathmatch games just because its fun for them... I can´t even remember the last time VAC did a ban wave, i believe was more than 1 year ago... ""On NB but you´re not talking about overwatch"" If you expect to ban some1 in overwatch it would take a lifetime to ban all the current cheaters, and im not ever considering they will create new acc´s. The concept is pretty decent, however is far from enough. 2- SMURFS  Smurfs are those skilless noobs who are not good enough for their own ranks, so they just get a 2nd account and start killing inocente silvers and gold novas to fell better about their own lack of skills, silvers and golds who can´t rank up due this ♥♥♥*ing inbreds ! 1/2 - THE 50% PROMOTION The both problems listed before are even worse when steam makes those 50% promotions on CS:GO ! Cheaters and smurfs just take the chance to get a 2nd account for half of the price ! I just gave up playing 1 month after these promotions (1month and im being optimistic) 3- SH*T COMMUNITY / KIDS / RUSSIANS (east europe scum) This game is just surounded by kids hacking and screamming like reta*ds, russians (By russians i also mean ukrainians, polish and all those fu*king sh*t hole countries in east europe, habitated by ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥), i also ""hate"" Turkish people due the fact of 90% of the turkish i play with are hacking ! I rly have nothing against russians, im a half-communist, the point is i live 4500km from Russia, betwen my country and Russia there are more than 10 countries, including Spain, France, UK, Germany, Italy .... i just don´t understand how the hell i still get russians in my servers ! And don´t come with the ""Use server picker"" bull*hit cuz we all know that doesn´t work. Pls steam.... just get the russians playing in russian servers ! Russians with russians, normal people with normal people, That would be a good start to make this game playable ! 4- IBERIAN SERVERS This isn´t exactly a global issue, but its a few thousands people issue ! In Portugal (where i live) and Spain ! The iberian community can´t just get a server with ping -70 ! Its just ridiculous playing with people with pings at 40/50 ! I rarely win a knife fight cuz the people who i fight with have ping lower than mine and then i get stabbed like a bitc*, even if its only 20 difference it matters (mainly in knife fights when every 0.001 second is important but we can see some delays with fire guns too) This only supports even more my argument of getting east europeans playing in their server and west europeans playing in western servers. Even tough in the last months i could find some decent iberian servers, the problem is iberian servers have Spanish players and there are only to types of them: the ones who hack, and the ones who su*k, the last one is about 70% based on my personal experience (the other 30% are cheaty twa*s. I rly think providing a good scurity system is the most important thing to do here ! Its an emergency ! I already gave up on this game, with me more toushands did and more toushands will, hope Steam and Valve take some drastic mesures before this game gets srounded only by 13yo fanboys to play it.

"This review is strictly from a balance perspective. If you just want to play as Silent Hill characters then go ahead and buy this. I never played any Silent Hill game but I just feel like their inclusion is pretty faithful to the series they came from. TL;DR: Killer is not good and more importantly not even fun to play. Wait for the devs to change him. Why I don't recommend this killer:  Is he good? No, not really. But that's not why I don't recommend him. The main reason is that he is boring to play. Just simply not fun. His main power is an attack that hits survivors in front of you to a certain distance. It can also go through walls. So far his power is pretty good, but wait there's more. First thing is that when you go to the stance of using your power you can't go backwards and turning right and left is really wonky. Second thing is that the hitbox is very narrow and easy to dodge and after you use it you will slow down for a bit and give the survivors enough time to go far away. The most effective use of this power is to use it when a survivor is locked in an animation like vaulting or dropping pallets. So then the survivors get trapped in this scenario where if they get locked in an animation they'll get hit by your power and if they don't vault or drop pallets then you can cancel your power and attack them normally with M1. This will make it so faking your power is better than actually using it MOST of the time. And if you care about bloodpoints then he's not even good at that because to get deviousness points you need to hit survivors with your power. His other power is leaving a trail of torment which when the survivor walks or runs (If they crouch then it won't effect them) on they'll get the torment status effect. If you down a survivor that is tormented then instead of grabbing them and hooking them you can immediately send them to a cage far away from you. The cage is basically the same as hook but is faster than grabbing them and hooking them. The bad thing is you don't activate your perks that rely on hooking like pop goes the weasel. Anther difference is when the survivor is in their second hook/cage state then instead of mashing they'll need to do skillchecks. Lastly, if you down a tormented survivor who is dead on hook then you can immediately kill them. In my opinion this torment thing is very underwhelming. You can counter decisive strike I guess by sending them to a cage instead of hooking them but they need to step on the torment trail in the first place. Now I'm not saying you can't do fun stuff with him. If you manage to get nurse's calling on him then you can snipe survivors when they heal through walls which is pretty fun. if you use the perk I'm all ears you can kinda do the same thing too. But I don't think these moments are worth it in the end.",False,False
"Geometry Dash perceptively employs a computative two-dimensional ""trial and error"" system and masquerades it as a rhythmically inclined arcade platformer that jumps into the mathematic realms of tedium. WHAT I LIKED: + Pick up and play. Geometry Dash, at its core, is an arcade game. One can simply choose a level dependent on their skill level, literally jump in and hope to complete it in what seems like a relatively swift turnaround. A rapid time-waster that never requires a vast amount of time and effort in order to complete the various deviously designed stages. Have five minutes to spare? Play through a stage or two. It makes the game hugely accessible for younger audiences who never adapt to the frustrations the game can cause, and also maturer players whom yearn to test their sharp reflexes. + Practice makes perfect. Robert Topala, the game's designer, kindly implemented a mode in which players can die, die and die again without having to restart the entire stage. This gives every player a chance to complete the level and memorise the sneaky obstacles and hidden collectible coins before attempting to challenge on the intended normal mode. Even then, some of those stages in practice mode can be taxing to complete... + Upload, download, play. Geometry Dash, despite being released back in 2014, still has a thriving online community of level creators and speed dashers. The amount of levels available for players to download and play to their heart's content is incalculably vast, with more still being uploaded as this review is being typed up. Fortunately, the intuitive in-game level designer makes this process quick, painless and surprisingly fun. WHAT I DISLIKED: - Geometry Dash is *not* a rhythm game. Whilst the pounding of techno music, the beats of dance music and the vibrancy of electronic music supply the game's official soundtrack, the levels that are designed around them do not supplement the tracks that accompany them. The player rarely jumps in time with the music and instead have to rely on a flurry of visual cues in order to navigate through the level. It juxtaposes the natural instinct of wanting to cooperate with the soundtrack, and makes for a weirdly frustrating experience. User generated levels tend to negate this issue, however considering most of the achievements and rewards come from the official levels it must be noted. - Vehicular mayhem. The robotic square that the player controls, flipping its sides to avoid spikes and other deadly traps, scrolls along smiling away. That is until it approaches a contraption that changes its shape into another classification of vehicular transportation. Flying saucer, space rocket, two-legged robotic dinosaur thing and many more. Problem is, they each employ a new control scheme that the player has to instantly adjust to before crashing into an oncoming obstacles and saying ""hello again!"" to the start of the stage. There is physically not enough time to react to these transitions and make it through the stage without having to rely on muscle memory. Who has the time for that? - Die, die, die, die...die and repeat. As stated, Geometry Dash relies on a ""trial and error"" mechanic in order for players to fully navigate each stage. The easier difficulties will require less time and effort, most likely being completed in one go (if you're skilled enough). The harder difficulties, as their categorisations might suggest, is near impossible to complete on a first try. Nor a second try. Nor a third try. Perhaps the hundredth attempt? The level design relies on memorisation of each obstacle as it arrives, where one simple slip up will send the player catapulting to the start over and over again. That's not fun. That's unfairly tedious. It does not reward players for their reflexes, but rather their capabilities of memorising the stage and persistently repeating the same segment for an hour or so. - Limited reward system. All the official levels, aside from two or three, are unlocked and available for players to jump into immediately. This means the rewards players earn for completing stages are only used to purchase cosmetic alterations, including new colours and shapes. Considering the struggle to complete the most challenging of levels, the available rewards are lacklustre and do not insight any motivation. Perhaps only to bang one's forehead onto their desk?

"I have never seen a solo game that requires you to log in at least once in three days or lose nearly all your progress. I don't think this is the innovation any of us need.  Just to make it clear: your land claim is destroyed if you don't log in within three days. Except for the items on your person, everything else - the equipment, buildings, items in the storage - either gets destroyed or becomes available for looting by other players. That is in the solo game on the pve server. If that is not a sufficient warning for you - and believe me, it should be; I don't write negative reviews lightly - let me tell you that there is very little sci-fi/futuristic/remote or near future value. There is no story. If the screenshots showing players raiding some sci-fi looking ruins led you to believe there is more to this game, there isn't. You build a house and you grind for resources. You grind a lot. Your missions are to collect x of resources, kill certain types of enemies, and reach certain areas on the map. And learn a bunch of skills on the skill tree. You build an eclectic mix of machinery that involves a bed that you cannot use (there is no ""resting"" in the game), a fire pit, a stove (and no, you do not replace or upgrade the fire pit with the stove; there are different recipes you can cook on either, so you end up accumulating what should rather be different progressive levels of equipment with the same function). Resource demands are ridiculous. I have posted on the forums that making a basic axe requires cutting multiple trees and smelting multiple - a lot - of ingots of metals, which is just not realistic the least bit, and the developer just replied that I got the numbers wrong. Guys, you are welcome to go and discover who is correct. It won't take long. It's the same story with every type of resources. You will need to eat like 15 steaks to not be hungry. Any moderately advanced armor, weapons or equipment require obnoxious volumes of resources. But fear not: there is so little to do in this game regardless that you can sustain just by logging in once in two-three days to make sure your land claim is still yours, maybe harvest your crops, maybe run maintenance if you let the building deteriorate a tad. That is about it. Oh, and there is no help. Good luck finding some of the quest areas like volcanoes on your own. The positives? It is visually appealing. But I wish I could get a refund.",False,True

"You may remember I wrote an extremely critical review on this game's release back in 2013, where I criticized some of the game's design choices, bad netcode, and DLC that made it extremely unpleasant to play. Going back to the game recently, it appears that at least the netcode issues have largely been resolved so (yay Relic!) on that part. A lot of my criticisms of the original release have by and large been resolved, though I will still point out some problems in the game. The publishers have taken the action of raising DLC prices on their in-game Store during major sales while giving discounts to make it seem as though you are receiving discounts off the item, which is not true as it is not only unethical and anti-consumer, but is also illegal in many regions. Should I also point to the fact that there are some fairly important bugs that were only uncovered recently despite the game having been released for quite a few years now (one being veterancy gained for reinforced squads). DLC I think is still a major issue for the game, but SEGA being SEGA... Some of the DLC do affect gameplay ever so slightly which can be fairly annoying if you're just starting out and don't want to spend money on the commanders.

"Well, it's a golf game. It's got modern graphics. It seems to have real world golfers, although as far as I know they could be just names on the leader board. I don't think you can play as them. I miss that. I miss the old golf games where you could easily play a round of golf on any course in the game (with many real courses to choose from) and many real world golfers to choose from. I thought that was the point of sport video games. Instead you create your own character and play as them. There are lots of accessories for you character, but most seem to be only unlockable with in-game currency that you have to buy with real money. Because microtransactions are the future. As far as gameplay goes playing is easy and works well enough, until you go to putt. Then you get to use a wonderful guesswork system that can have you accidentally barely hitting the ball or sending it flying 20 yards past the hole. This control scheme would probably work with a wiimote, but not with a mouse. You are forced to use this control scheme because consumer choices are not something big game companies like. In fact there are almost no control options--no key rebinding, only sensitivity adjustment. I don't find it fun enough or interesting enough, and as casual or non player of sports games, I find them to be very disappointing these days. I find myself thinking of all sorts of cool stuff that could be in them that isn't, and may never be. At this point in time, you are probably better off playing a pre-2008 golf/insert-sport-of-choice-here game. This still being $50 despite there being a newer version just seems greedy, and I would not recommend spending that on this game. I got it for $5. Might be worth $20.

"is the latest broken and buggy mess from Tero Lunkka, and while I certainly bear no ill will towards budding developers, the quality of his game-shaped objects are not improving. How bad is it? In no specific order: ❌ No introduction of any kind. Tutorial is a text menu with hard to read font and terrible formatting. ❌ Clipping everywhere. Objects not aligned with the terrain. Go around back to see an endless void behind surfaces ❌ Combat is a trainwreck. No way to lock on enemies. Constant need to change direction to face them. You can run from every encounter and avoid combat altogether, making it pointless to waste time on. Some enemies are unarmed entirely, rendering them harmless. ❌ Very high regeneration makes you nearly impossible to kill. Higher level enemies can barely be damaged at all. Probably requires crafting, but I couldn't figure out how to upgrade a single thing. ❌ No way to expand the minimap.

"This became LITERALLY the worst BATTLE-ROYALE game you can play, there are some cons: - Game not optimised, even tho i have a really good pc, i'm still having ""LAG SPIKES"" , also after last update, my game freezes without letting me open task manager, or close it by alt f4, or alt tab, nothing worked, i had to restart my pc - NO LOOT, Really, there is barely loot, for such a long time they cannot make loot better, no matter what map you play, you will not find the proper items all the time, specially on the new map called ""KARAKIN"" where you barely find anything - Most of the time with SERVER LAG, having ""PACKET LOSS"" all the time, from 5% up to 15% sometimes even 40-50%, and this is a common issue to all the players i meet around the game - The game is still FULL of BUGS, which they haven't fixed for a LONG time, such as a BUG where you hit a corner of something, it drops you out of it and you get KNOCKED instantly, that's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to die in the first second due to a bug, isn't it? - Cheaters, yes, you heard it, THERE ARE ALOT OF CHEATERS, even tho they are Banning them, there are still alot of cheaters because of their INCAPABILITY to create a proper ANTI-CHEAT System - Sometimes the map is darker, sometimes is brighter, in certain areas of the map, like, wtf is that?, it makes us unable to loot / see enemies sometimes specially in the darker zones",False,False
"Today Is My Birthday (TIMB) was unfortunately a colossal disappointment, filled with countless glitches and buggy gameplay with little redeeming qualities. Being a horror aficionado, I will safely say this is not something I recommend to any fan of the genre, at least in its current state. I am hopeful developers will address and improve on the many issues mentioned and view it as constructive criticism. + Loading screen artwork + Steam achievements. - Huge FPS drops throughout the entire game. - Crashes multiple times in the (extremely long) loading screens or stutters with a black screen. - Atrocious, almost comedic voice acting. - Complete lack of tension building or horror atmosphere. - Terrible AI that get auto triggered when in a certain radius (even if their back is turned) and will simply stop chasing once you pass an invisible border. - No objectives or basic hints (I am aware developers are working on improving this). - Extremely clunky gameplay, players get stuck on everything. - Amateurish animations - Stunning enemies with the camera flash only occasionally works. - Difficult to pick up items or interact with them. - Awfully optimised lighting and shadows, specifically when outdoors. - Very low stamina which also glitches running, sometimes I couldn't run at all despite having a full bar. - Cannot pause the game while holding the camera The protagonist, Thomas Wilkes treks back to his childhood amusement park, 'Wonder Park' after the sudden passing of his father. Having spent multiple birthdays at the attraction, Thomas wishes to relive this happy period of his life but finds the park not only abandoned and decrepit but filled with nightmarish happenings beyond his imagination. Thomas is a photographer and once he realises the amusement park is not so abandoned after all, he decides to take photo evidence for the police. Yet, he doesn't turn around and go back, instead he goes deeper into the park, exploring everywhere. Perhaps I missed the dialogue stating he had run out of fuel, which I suppose is the likely outcome. But why would he travel to a knowingly abandoned amusement park, at night, with not enough fuel to come back is beyond me. But then again, horror lore has never been typically bright, but this just seems entirely implausible.  This is where TIMB really goes downhill and I fail to see any sort of redeeming feature. Players explore the areas, with no objective or hints which I see others mentioning negatively, however, I could get by without any sort of direction and generally found my way ok by aimlessly running around and exploring everywhere.  TIMB chooses to rely on a survival horror gameplay style, whilst simultaneously ignoring all critical horror elements such as sound, atmosphere, dread etc. Instead, enemies are scattered throughout the park and will usually immediately start chasing players once we get too close, even if their back is turned. This is not scary in the slightest and they are usually rather slow, they will also give up chase once you get slightly out of their clearly defined area of movement, further demeaning the idea of horror and immersion. Typically, this would happen when I was desperately trying to run around and look for what on Earth I am supposed to be doing, resulting in getting hit a few times before dying. Luckily, I found the autosave was frequent, letting me explore the area to deduce my objective before stepping into the room that always auto generates the enemy spawning. Players can use a camera flash to temporarily stun enemies chasing, this feature sometimes works, sometimes doesn't. While it's not bad in theory, it really doesn't work at all in the game and was more frustrating than anything else. Interestingly, players also obtain a gun which I was rather excited about, but bullets are few and far between. I explored most areas and found barely any. There is no hiding or stealth which is surprising for a survival horror and as mentioned previously, enemies are typically generated to automatically chase players, regardless of your level of stealth. If you just run past their designated routes, you're completely safe. Personally, the game’s biggest disappointment is its seemingly disregard for horror at all. It had such promise with a spooky, deserted theme park yet the final product couldn't have been more wrong. Having played a considerable amount of horror titles here on Steam, ranging from AA titles  to one-man amateur developers, the only way I can explain this outcome is just laziness. The number of bugs is immeasurable and plays as if nothing was tested previously.  I do not believe that good quality graphics are a prerequisite for a decent horror and in some cases, it isn't really important at all. TIMB is average, with nothing outstandingly bad nor good. However, it does struggle immensely with its lighting and some objects cut through walls, but I don't think this is a reason to avoid the game. On a positive note,  the artwork in the loading screens and the illustrations depicting the characters are fantastic. Sound is perhaps one of the defining features in this genre and can easily make or break players immersion. This is an example of it doing the opposite of what was intended. The voice acting, mainly of the Doc is some of the worst I've seen all year. It is extremely over the top, clearly fake and childish. Maybe if this was for a more kid-friendly spooky story it may have been acceptable, but in this setting and with the intended audience, I am not sure what the thought process was for utilising these actors. Despite the store page stating the haunting soundtrack is not for the faint hearted, I must disagree. I found it was usually mixed with stuttering sounds or no sound at all, the soundtrack was generally unnoticeable. I could write copious pages on this section however I will try keep it brief. I hope developers can take this constructively and at least slightly improve its current problems. Previously mentioned in my cons section, the entire game is extremely jittery and not smooth at all. Players get stuck on everything, struggle to pick items up,  cannot walk upstairs without jumping, as if the protagonist’s legs are so short, he cannot traverse up a slope?  There is also a run and jump scene which was one of the most frustrating areas. It is extremely difficult to move freely, let alone jump onto a platform and then run and jump onto a faraway train. There are two levers which are supposed to move but they only occasionally work as designed. I also experienced a manifold of FPS drops, occurring randomly and usually resulted in my character dying, or crashing. The lighting/shading is so badly optimised I had to use a torch outdoors in the bright open forest. Simply put, there are too many issues to list here. It pains me to give such a negative review for a game I was so enthusiastic to play, being my favourite genre, however, I found TIMB to be a chore to play. I truly hope the developers take more time before releasing another horror and fix the aforementioned issues. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this at full price, nor on a sale.",False,False
"When I heard about an Alesso Heist through a Twitter leak, I thought it was another practical joke from Overkill. But when addressing serious matters Overkill jokes, and when joking around, it turns out they’re serious. The John Wick pack was free of charge, and the Hotline Miami heist had good gameplay, good content, and wasn’t egregious when it came to the cross-promotion. But the Alesso Heist isn’t any of those. The heist itself is merely a one-day heist contracted by Bain (who else?), who constantly gives the celebrity of the hour enough shilling to qualify himself as a paid billboard. Alesso signs everywhere, product-placement for the musician all around and nothing but praise is given to Alesso when any serious heister would be apathetic at best. But let’s assume it wasn’t a commercial in disguise. The layout can be confusing for newer players due to the deceptive nature of the passage ways, never mind the dead-brained AI heisters who constantly get lost. To complete the heist, one must go behind the shops, go to the basement, then to the highest floor to hijack the concert (guided by an insufferable jive turkey), back down to the basement to extract the loot, then back up to secure it. In an undercover run one has to avoid detection in open and windy corridors while in a firefight navigating through the labyrinth whilst fighting the heavily armed enemies. There’s barely enough time to get from A to B without keeping these factors in check. Preplanning is absent. While this can be justified being a Bain job rather than The Dentist hosting the mission, the map is so large that the random-numbers generation that places the assets available is unfavorable. Not to mention the complete lack of spotters or spy cameras which would be useful for someone stealthing for the first time. The weapons included aren’t much to speak of. As usual the melee weapons are filler and often outclassed by others before them. The revolver sticks out due to being compatible with laser sights, but is otherwise completely forgettable. The Bronco usually serves better in its league anyway. Let’s find the positives in this DLC. Obviously the weapons provided make it theoretically higher in value than The Diamond, another controversial heist that lacked any weapons whatsoever. Bag-hauling has been circumvented slightly thanks to the chutes connected between the basements and the shops above it, in addition to the zipline deployed in a loud mission. The music, orchestrated by Alesso rather than Simon Viklund, is also enjoyable. The music itself cannot be adjusted and is synchronized with much of the gameplay (more so than usual that is). Sadly that’s not enough for me to declare this as the worst DLC-mission so far, more than The Diamond. At least The Diamond was enjoyable to play without friends, and had a more substantial payout. Those who are complacent in accessing every heist available should only buy this on sale, and not before obtaining everything else.",False,False

"Okay, where exactly do I start?! I guess I start with the few postive aspects and I mainly will talk about the competitive part of the Game. The Game itself is pretty nice Pro: 1) Good sound engine and every weapon feels unique. 2) Good Performance: We have high fps, nearly no drops and a decent Server Connection. 3) Map Variety: Most Maps are very enjoyable and just slightly edited versions of the older CS/CSS Maps. 4) Many Modes: You can play Battle Royal ""Danger Zone"", Death Match to improve a specific weapon, community servers. 5) Competitive: I am just a huge fan of getting better and better and trying to reach a higher tier. This only made me grind the Game so hard. Neutral: Skins: There are really some dope Skins out there but dont you ever open cases.  Its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ scam...I invested more than 500 USD into this Game and got nothing but worthless blue ♥♥♥♥ skins. So just don't let yourself think you can make profit out of gambling...its NOT RANDOM with what you end up. Now, lets talk about the things which made me even write this review. Con: 1) A lot of f*cking cheating players! Some Cheaters play very obvious just to f*ck you up and some play more careful to make it look legit. But let me tell you there are thousands of cheaters in CS:GO. 2) VAC is the by far the worst Anti Cheat System ever! 3) CS:GO/Valve give zero f*cks about the fact, people are massive cheating in their Games. I believe, they rather wait over 180 days to ban a obviously cheating guy, because they hope he might invested money in Scam Cases and Skins...and if they got enough Money they might ban him 4) By the way seems like Overwatch is useless anway. 5) F2P ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, made even more people hack. 6) Prime or Non Prime doesnt matter...you end up with Cheaters anyway 7) My Steam Level is 42, my Steam Account is nearly 12 Years old, I have 0 VAC Bans and I am still getting those Lvl 0, not even 1 Year old Accounts with maybe 3 friends in their list...seems about f*cking right. 8) Toxic and Troll Community 9) The whole Matchmaking itself! Whenever I search solo, me as a German, always getting matched with and/or against 5 Russians, Turks, Indians, Pakistani or even Chinese Player. Which is just stupid! Do not get me wrong here but the biggest problem here is the communication. You cant play a very competitive Game like Counter Strike with people who cant speak English at all. You cant tell me there are no people playing CS:GO in West Europe.  How about giving a West Europe Player other players from West European Countries like: Germany, Britain, France, Spain, Netherlands, Denmark and so on...That cant be so hard. I already set my matchmaking ping to 50...doesnt work and as I said the connection InGame is NOT a problem. So always try to play with a FUL TEAM or with at least 1 or 2 Friends. So if you want to play this game competitive try FACEIT. There are not less cheaters and trolls but still there are some. Otherwise dont waste your time in Competitive Matchmaking. Ofc you can play DeathMatch or some other Game Modes but thats not a thing for me! As long as this cheating epidemic is going on: I ABSOLUTELY CAN NOT RECOMMEND THIS T-R-A-S-H GAME!",False,False

"Far Cry 5 was a awesome game, yet it had it flawes as others would point out, was well balanced and slight longevity to it, yet the Far Cry New Dawn seems like a cut down version of Far Cry 5 a simple cut and paste map, added a lot of colour and left the game world at that. Most of the map from the original Far Cry 5 can not be accessed due to the nuclear bombs and fallout, yet to charge this amount for the game seems way too high. This would have made a decent Dlc for Far Cry 5 and close the chapter and get ready for Far Cry 6. But there is still a load of things that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me with this (Shall we call a Dlc) :-)  I am like others who like to explore there game world so completing it in 10 hours or less means you rush through it to get it finished. A lot of the voice actor return to voice the characters from the original Far Cry 5  and some do it well, others are a let down. Spoiler Alert: Father or aka Joseph Seed, is a watered down character, exiled and lives far to the north, he is not the character from the original Far Cry 5 as seeing as the nuclear fallout has cured his need for sun glasses, scratches his head a lot but also has the tendency to scratch his butt a lot. he is voiced by the original Greg Bryk yet this time seems like they cut the voice budget as he seems like he is talking in a bucket, the voice acting is a massive let down, yet seeing other characters 17 years later is a nice touch that some made it. Also seeing as I have not yet finished my play through yet, not once so far have I heard of the last PC from Far Cry 5 mentioned.  Boomer and Cheeseburger are no longer available as they most likely died also Peaches. So you get Timber is a scout, like Boomer and Horatio is a tank,  like Cheeseburger. you also get that stupid guy Hurk Drubman Jr, Pastor Jerome,  Nana a geriatric sniper who uses comedy dialogue to keep it alive, yet gets boring after a while.

I could live with outdated graphics but that's not all: CM's gameplay is very clumsy, aliens just rush on you, story is really flat and has plotholes, most of the characters are plain annoying and ridiculous and... it lacks any suspense from earlier AVP - games (even AVP3). What's most surprising is that the final DLC (Stasis Interrupted) feels even better than anything from the main game; even though the gameplay hasn't changed any bit, most of the plotholes are fixed by this, such as  . It's still such a shame to see so much potential go to waste and post-release scandal about which studio actually developed this is just the tip of the iceberg. Gearbox (especially Randy Pitchford) is now on my black list for lying about this product and in the end for giving this... puke. Avoid this as much as you can.

"I see this becomming the next 'Dark & Light'. A great concept of a game based on successful ARK mechanics. Ark mechanics that will get dicarded and gradually forgotten because, well... too much. Too much what? Overcomplication. Simple answer. Long explanation. Lets start with food. So now there is vitamins... okay cool, I can dig it. How about we remove the debuffs and all the negative jargon for vitamin deficiencies? Sugestion: Make vitamins a mini-game of sorts, if you balance your diet you get buffs, if not just stay fed and you don't have to deal with de-buffs. This is not an MMORPG. Lets please leave that distinction to games such as WoW, Asherons Call, Earth & Beyond, and EverQuest to mention a few, and even those games are not trying to micro-manage gamers toon food intake- for real folks, lets take it down a notch. Just a humble gamers opinion. How about those resources needed, eh? I have been playing on a 3x resource server, spent about 4 hours gathering, still don't have all the resources for the cannons but took that long to put together a Scooner. That's solo gathering FYI. No cannons yet, just the boat and sails. Did I mention I have found 4 variations of 'hide' so far? Why in the general *&%$ do you need 4 or more variations of the same bloody resource? 0.o Now start reading posts about how crazy NPC ship spawns are... then lets tack on try playing on an official server to get that above task done. In other words, if you plan on playing, plan on being part of a company (AKA: Guild /Faction /Clan /Alliance /Fleet /or whatever you want to call it). Good luck finding one that is not ran by Nazi Overlords with the attitude they own everything because they exist. If you beat those odds you have to deal with all of the other BS on official servers, including jerk Companies that think they own the whole game because they exist. Seriously, this game genre does not invite people that want to just play to have fun anymore when it is put to the public like this... everyone want to own, conquer, own, conquer, ect. They have no choice, they have lives to live, not time to grind in a game. Easy path. I can see why folks would want to do the above looking at the gather rates vs resources needed, lets make the whole friggin game a giant pyramid scheme, standing on the shoulders of the defenceless folks that are unable to gather the immense resources needed due to real life full time jobs/school/ect. These game cater to folks that are fully connected in gaming anymore, bottom line. How about that taming? One would think you could tame a parrot for your shoulder fairly easy... and one would be wrong. First you have to learn skills (spend accrued points after gaining levels) to do said taming. This is no simple tame though like folks would assume (or LIKE!!!!), oh no no no- first you have to bola it, cuz the grey text when you look at it says so. Ok, bola equipped. WAIT! Now there is some message about the critter has too much health?! 0.o Well lets punch it! Yup still too much health, hit it again! Dead parrot. Crud. Okay, found another, lets try again, little different though. Punch it! Yup, still too much health as expected. Wait for it to heal up a bit, maybe to 75%, and get the crap beat out of yourself by the angry parrot while that happens (we having fun yet? bet this is how the Devs love to play the game right?). Punch it again! Well lag missed, then swing and miss, then disconnect from game, reconnect and start over. Okay so we are at parrot 75% health and land that hit! Now bola it! Bola it--- Bola? Hello? respond game! Latency, for Pete's sake, if not for Pete do it for me. Ok, whelp wait for that parrot to get to 75%-ish health again I guess. So, here we are, parrot at 75%, me taking full swing and a hit! Equiped bola without a hitch (one in a row, wo0t!) and nailed the parrot! YES! Wait a minute... it wants to be fed what?! Where in Atlas do you find that crap?? Its just a lvl 4 parrot for the love of god! If it doesnt like the food here then IT SHOULDNT BE LIVING HERE. Seriously when the crew behind ARK related games comes out with a new one, expect nothing less than being Dev Trolled. At this point I honestly feel these guys sit in a room and try to think of ways to screw with end users. Really, try to boil everything down a different way. Lvl 8 max on starter islands? Remind anyone of any MMORPG starter areas that ever existed? Again, this is not an established game, just an alpha that will be alpha as long as it can humanly possibly be...  I will recommend it to folks that have gaming connections. I will recommend it to anyone that wants to grind resources (vanilla settings) for 6-10 hours to complete something that will get destroyed in minutes. I however do NOT recommend this to casual gamers, NON-YouTubers, or folks that have not had this whole game handed to them on a silver platter unlike some folks that have like the special server set up for YouTubers from what I understand (free advertising sort of?). ---Please for the love of whatever you hold dear Tubers if you read this... dont sell out and give false impressions or delusions of granduer on how a game is played. What you experience vs what the average person gets is two different things in this case with your special server. I love the geniune folks, so you guys please dont get suckered into showing gameplay that only exists so that you can get exploited to advertise something average end consumers CAN NOT HAVE. Be mindful of what you see on the vids across the internet about this game, try to find mundane players vids to see what will be in store for you. Just my advise. If the devs pull through and don't gradually abandon this game like Dark & Light was then I will change my recommendation. Will be a year before my next review on this, make up your own mind folks, these are just my words. Have fun, pardon my spelling please, Cya out there!",False,True

"I really hate leaving negative reviews. A game has to be really flawed for that to happen. This is my first negative. Why? Because it's Match-3. Forget the topic it supposedly covers (which it does extremely poorly). The basics of modern Match-3 aren't even present. You cannot swap tiles except by clicking on one and then clicking on another. Considering the timer involved, this is time wasted. Virtually every money-grab Match-3 has managed to at least get the drag-and-drop tile swapping correct. On top of this fatal flaw, I was able to complete the entire game in less than an hour. There's a reason Steam has chosen to label this one with ""Profile Features Limited"". Nothing about this game is redeeming enough to make it worth anything. It should be Free. I play almost all casual games with the sound off, so I'm not even going to bother with that. This thing is $8 full price -- which I didn't pay. The standard tends to be $1/hr. This is so far off base that the ""developers"" should re-think their purpose in life.",False,False

I like the game but there many bad things so I will give negative review. let start with pros - many class - good art and music - good combat system now let's talk about bad things - many bugs - TOO MANY BOT and developer can't really stop them. I see bot almost every map I go and I just confuse that developer let these bot level to 100-200+ - Very lag right now - TOO FEW dungeon channel. You must wait for more than hours to do dungeons or spam till your keyboard broken. - Always gold seller message. Again they can't stop these people even they shout at center of town lol - restricted common feature example normal trade etc. They say it help protect bot and gold seller but outside town bot is more than players ... - Token system make too much different from Free and Pay player. You still can play for free but you will have a lot disadvantages.  - The pet is useless and take character slot so if you play hunter and falconer class you can only make one more character. - Too much grinding - EXP system is bad if you make it wrong you may get struck at some levels for a long time. - Many class is good and fun but they are really not balance for now and we will see most people play same build. - maybe more but I just forgot... Conclusion This is Free to Play game but I seriously feel like it Pay to WIN.  The restricted common system and Token that make to stop bots not work but I think it can stop free player instead. Just say that this is system to make people PAY. I regret buying the DLC and really want refund. I still like this game but many systems make it very bad for FREE TO PLAY GAME You can still play free for fun when it out But  ******NOT RECOMMEND TO BUY******,False,False

"This game is fun for awhile, until the game doesn't let you get out of the rank you are in forever. And gun play seems more relied on luck then skill. I am a awp and pistol main. I can see even noobs are able to casually run and awp and headshot me all the time. And even doing basic shots don't work or register at all, even when that blood comes out of em. For a free game it's super fun but i spent money on it and it only made the hacker population double. Source code got leaked and made the game unplayable for a month or two. DDoS's and leaked info was obtained easily and was not a good situation for everyone including valve.

"After more then a year that this game has spent in early access hell, I'm just overall very disapointed in the progress of this game. It's just a complete buggy mess with random server disconnects and other little problems. This game has a small poor server selection, most of the time I have to play on a 150 plus ping server. This game just doesn't have the same fear factor as KF1 and for $29.99 it just isn't worth it. What makes me mad most of all about this game that TWI decides to work on putting microtransactions instead of working on all the bugs in this pile of garbage, with this game slated for reslease this november I just don't see how they are anywhere near ready. KF2 has barely any maps that are new, I have to search for a server with modded maps just so I can stay interested in playing this junk. I say for now don't waste your hard earned money until this game is officially 100% released.",False,True
"I had fun in the first chapter, even though it was (understandably) easy, it promised a lot. Levels got more and more challenging one step at a time. After level 13, nothing really happened anymore. It was just the same level all over again. We have four buildings: Shop, cement factory, cake shop (huh?) and a factory. Shop brings us money, cake shop bakes cupcakes that are needed in the factory while building walls and cells. I understand that they have to eat, but still, cupcakes! It does the fit the overall look of the game though, it's bright and colourful. Background music made me smile on numerous occasions, it's exactly how you'd think it would be when looking at pictures. It's perfect for this game, captures the lightweight mood of the game, overly happy keyboard pop music. Based on how many stars we achieve, we are awarded with gems. Gems are used to buy bonuses that are faster workers, faster production and automated resource collecting. This is where the game starts to feel like a P2W game. It's extremely hard, nearly impossible to reach 3 stars without using the gems. It isn't about time management anymore, it's deliberately planned so that you need to use them. It takes away the fun from the playing, it doesn't matter anymore what you do. You are just going to click mindlessly and hope this level would be the last one while boosted by the gems. With them, the levels are too easy. So it's either next-to-impossible difficulty or very easy. The levels are also very simple. Same goals in multiple levels, with slighty different layout on the factories and few different blocks on the roads that need to be cleared before the resources can be collected. There is one positive thing though that engages the player. You meet gangsters and thieves that you must click a few times in order to eliminate them. Thieves bring a bit tower defense-vibe to the game as they slowly creep towards your warehouse. Of course, they became repetitive as well eventually. A gangster for example, appearing every single time next to my resource at the same moment my resource became ready. I mentioned the history facts and trivia quizzes. Facts were interesting to read between every level, even though short ones, just a few lines in a box. There are inmate names, info about their routines, escapees and rumours about alcatrazz. The small quizzes amidts the level then again test your history knowledge about alcatraz, giving you three choices to answer from. These were definitely the most interesting part of the game. Not enough to buy the game though, nothing you couldn't read on google for free.",False,False

I'm in favor of more art experiences on Steam. The platform already has plenty of real games. + No fillers. The game is about as long as it should be for the experience that it aim to provide, which is just a few minutes.  Cons: - Nothing about the game is actually good. The idea, controls, graphics, sound are all poor and don't add up to anything that's worth your time. The music (a single song) is ok, but not as moving as it could be. - Instructions are misleading.  This game is not worth buying.

I personally didn't go for the GOLD edition, which states you get ALL free upcoming DLC. But, not this huge content pack. people who purchased the gold edition will still need to throw more money to get what they already should have payed for.

Finding a match is now basically impossible. I've waited up to 20+ min on a peek time, on a ""Very high activity"" mode. every day now, it seems that there is not a single person playing. its a shame, it's just a shame what Ubisoft have done to this game it used to be fun, but now its almost unplayable.",False,False

"The game was ok at start and followed a logic of checkpoints in case of a fail which it followed until the very end in which the checkpoint was right next to the gate instead of outside where the snow was, forcing me to end it without wanting to and explore that hall more. So because it didn't follow the safety logic until the end and made you force end the game without your volition I wanted to give it a 8/10 but won't, I give it a 6/10, that was something that ruined my experience of it and got me extremely annoyed by it doing that. In order to go back and do it you need to redo the whole game, no, I am uninstalling it right now and I hope the programmers fix such stupid rookies mistakes in the future. I mean come on, the real exit was like 20 meters ahead of you but you put the script to end the game and not allowing even a checkpoint in case the player wanted to explore more, now that's stupid and you should learn from that. An easy fix would be a confirmation to end the game too. That gate ending right as soon as you step out angered me extremely because I was returning back towards the hall too, just came around it to see if there is something on the other side.

"Some absolutely garbage design decisions get a ""No"" from me.   The majority of negative reviews echo my own thoughts on this game, but there is one major bad decision that is the nail in the coffin. At the end of the main world 1, there is an escape sequence, where you have to escape a giant tree verticially which is filling up with water.  Which is about 4 minutes of extremely precise and difficult platforming, with no checkpoints.  You die and you have to do the entire thing over. What makes this particularly frustrating is that the ""platforming"" involves jumping ""off"" of moving projectiles.  Which move at a fairly speedy pace.  Miss once, start the whole section again. Apparently, there's two more of these such moronic sequences for each of the two later worlds.  Frustrating and unfun.  I did actually beat this section that I'm complaining about, but it's unforgivably terrible.  Not recommended. EDIT:  I just beat the game.  Yes, these annoying chase sequences still happen.  On the whole, the game was frustrating and not fun.  I persisted because the overall vibe of the game was good in terms of design and music, but overall I can't say my playthrough was a positive one.",False,False
Greetings. I received this product for free and was thoroughly disappointed with the gift I received. For starters the GUI (Graphical User Interface) was of shabby quality. The ear-rape intro music is enough decibels to literally blast you off your chair. When opening the game I advise you to turn the game volume down to one via the Sound Control Panel. Additionally the game extremely boring causing me to leave immediately after the tutorial. I do not recommend this game to anyone who's brain has not rotted and does not want to decompose where they sit. Play at your own peril.,False,False

"Well, pre-ordered the game just for the fun of it. But after 4 hours of gameplay i can only say this: Kingdoms of Amalur is waaaay better than this crap. Same goes for Divinity II, Risen 3 and Lords of the Fallen...they are way way better than Dragon's Dogma. Why? Just take a look at the crap upscaled font used in the game, dull combat mechanics and hell, everything else. The hud seems upscaled too ... maybe if i would play the 800x600 it would look better ... NOT! As for the story, wooow, boring ... really boring. I didn't even ask for a refund because I feel so sorry for the developers. They can take my money as a beggar can.

"Paladins, a freebie version of Overwatch but with much more characters. Annoying thing? You gotta buy the champion pack with $$ or play tons of matches just to buy that one champion. While a freebie, it's still surprisingly fun with the biggest issue being it's matchmaking. PROS - Wide variety of heroes to keep the player interested, assuming you don't mind it's balancing problems. - Certain skins can be obtained for free - The game runs smoothly, however an unexpected crash may happen from time to time. - Auto-purchase towards passives you can obtain in each game, based on how well you do. So if ur on the losing side, expect to stay on the losing side as making a come back is more difficult. CONS - Matchmaking is the worst I've seen from any competitive game - Only a small number of maps between the 3 game modes. - The game is imbalanced in terms of certain heroes. One such example is there is a champion who almost has an execute for any champions below 30% hp. Yes that includes tanks as well. - For a competitive game, I've yet to come across a player who wants to talk in game... - If a player leaves, they are replaced by a bot who aims and plays like an Easy AI. Note you don't get warned when a player leaves. - Disconnections can randomly happen and you are stuck in an infinite loading screen unless you crash the game with task manager.  Matchmaking I've put as a Con, I'll give you a quick rundown on how bad it can get, rather suddenly as well. First couple of weeks of playing the game I decided to main Ying while trying out a few I can buy with gold. Few days a go I was on a surprisingly high 86% win rate. After that I've been on a losing streak for the past 50 games now. which has me down to 31% win rate now, in only a week. If non-ranked games are like this, I'll assume it's much worse for ranked. If this isn't a game you want to play competitively then this section of the review shouldn't bother you. Overall The game is fun, just the real question being do you really care about a game's balancing? Would the matchmaking bother you if you went on a rather absurd losing streak? If both answers are no then deffo give the game a shot.",False,False
"I love tWoM and can't get enough content for this game, but it should work to be worth paying for it. I like the concept of this DLC and it can add a lot of possible gaming experience you otherwise would miss out on. But until the over a year old bug is fixed (the child just standing in front of a filled up frige and starving without being able to do anything) I just can't give it a thumb up. Also: I hoped for more for the children then just being there and helping a bit housholding. I love the fact that you have to teach them how to do things but a couple of new characters that only raise the difficulity of the game aren't worth the full prize of the DLC. Seriously this just ads a harder gameplay.

Then I had to suffer for the achievements all along. But what was a pity! My advice, if you would start it as well, is the secret keys (buttons): Escape, Quit (immediately).

"""Timberman: All the fun of working in the firewood business without any of that boring getting paid for your labour or getting a reasonable price for your precious commodity crap to get in the way of the excitement of being a rejected character from a mildly amusing and slightly trans-phobic Monty Python sketch minus the catchy tune to distract you. Sounds like a solid concept to me, the promise of hours of fun! Gee, I can hardly contain myself! Can you?""  When I was a child, as the eldest son chopping and bringing in the firewood was a chore I was assigned during the winter months. So believe me when I say I know that chopping wood is fundamentally chore-like. There's a reason why my Dad insisted that I take on this responsibility as soon as I was old enough to swing an axe. It is a tedious and thankless task which nobody in their right mind would volunteer to do. So as you might understand playing this game is extremely chore like. I would be remiss if I did not mention that 8-player multiplayer is really quite fun when none of your opponents are cheating. This does not happen that often, but does happen as have I asked one guy how he was able to chop wood so fast and he said he used autofire on his controller :( And when played on a computer then it's nowhere near as good as when you play it on android. So take my advice and get the Android version instead. 3.3/10 Extremely competitive 2-8 player online multiplayer saves this from being no fun at all. But not from complete and total mediocrity. Oh and the short music loop really gets on my pecs after about 4 repetitions. And if you can't think of something better to do with your hands than play this then you are seriously lacking in imagination.

"I bought this game and returned it the same day.  The world design is awkward and the story seems interesting but isn't prefaced well enough in the prologue for the player to have a good grasp on what the hell is happening. Further more, the prologue seems to act as a tutorial, and a very poor one at that.      The fighting is clunky (took me 3 minutes to kill 2 guards because no hits were landing, despite the fact I was basically standing inside their hitbox) and the game mechanics are there but aren't explained. You're briefed on a total of 1 monsters in the tutorial (which is also poorly explained) and then immediately thrust into the open world part of the game with a bunch of new monsters that are very good at killing you, even on the lowest difficulty setting. (I like to have fun when playing games, okay? I don't like the Dark Souls approach, but I'm not terrible at games either.)    In summary, the various ideas and concepts the game presents are very interesting. However, they are poorly executed, resulting in a clunky and awkward gaming experience.

Heed the negative reviews, they stand true. Mountain Trap: the Manor of Memories is a bore. Like others have already said, this HOG is a chore to play.  I don't despise it, I've played worse, but the overall issue is that this HOG lacks the very tools that makes these games fun & worth playing. -No Map, which means no fast travel. There are too many locations to be without a map. -The hint button is virtually useless.  -Journal and Task list are practically useless as well.  -Puzzles are a hit or miss. -The voice acting... what is up with that?? Everyone sounds like they're either whispering or recording inside of a cave with a dozen echoes. If there were no subtitles I'd be lost to the story.

"Now... I guess the best thing I can say about Prospekt is that its concept is well executed, and that there is at least a portion of the game that really ties in with the Half-Life 2 spirit... BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUT 1) The game is too hard, even on normal. I couldn't count how many times I double-barrel shot a combine in the head TWICE before he had to die... 2) The level design, is ludicrous. You are being pitched against waves of combine after every door and elevator with NO WAY TO HIDE. 3) The voice-overs, although high in quality, sound too amateur to be convincing and disconnect the original Half-Life spirit from Prospekt. 4) Buttons, buttons and buttons. 5) The story, which each time triggers an incredibly annoying effect as you recall flashbacks from the past, is underdeveloped, but it's not the main part of the game as it focusses heavily on combat, just don't expect a satisfying tale that will move or motivate you in any significant way. The ending is mediocre and almost a carbon copy of the beginning if you look at it from a distance. I have to say I really welcome and applaud the additional combine machinery design that can be found across the levels, and the smart use of the cubemaps. My favorite level was the teleport level, even though it just repeated the same button idea all over again. Soundtrack is excellent, one of the closest things that could absolutely fit in an original Half-Life game, as much as the actual sound design. I would rate this game a 6/10. Just don't forget that after all, this was made by one person, it's just sad that that really shows in the game.",False,False

"As much as I loved this game, I cannot recommend it as it is right now. The amount of glitches and bugs make this game almost unplayable. I could go on with specific examples such as many side quests, that are simply most of time frozen and you are stuck at the objective, which exists on the map but not in the world for some reason, like the bees and honey quest, which was mentioned on several forums since 2017 and nobody bothered to fix it. Motigene Gives You Wings freezes the character and you are unable to talk to him to complete the quest. Superb Meat Boy quest breaks through the last cutscene and therefore you are unable to complete it. You can even accidently fail a quest as you get attacked by people or characters are stuck inside the walls. Not mentioning the worst and most frustrating glitch I experienced half way through the first Act - save option being disabled. No matter what I did, restarting the game, killing myself/restarting the level, taking and completing quests, moving from one district to another, entering buildings etc the game did NOT allow me to manually save the progress. It did fortunatelly autosaved after completing the quests, but when I tried to exit the game, the message popped up saying that the game cannot be saved because the character is busy or something like that. Overall performance issues, unstable FPS, many technical problems, blurred textures, invisible obstacles, frozen animations, broken quests and game breaking issues. Sometimes the cutscene ends but the game doesn't detect it and you are stuck in the letterbox view with and not being able to move. It's a real shame, because the game has a big potential, great creepy atmosphere and beautiful detailed sceneries. If you like Fallout, Bioshock, Bendy and Ink Machine sort of games, you would love this game for sure!

The game consists of 3 sounds and one music track, that's all there is, so if you came for spectacular music, leave. And did I mention that they're using royalty free music and sounds? Amazingly, the game takes only a few minutes to complete (*shocker*), so if you want to obtain all 4999 (notice I didn't say 5000) achievements, it'll only take you a few minutes to do so. He's not trying to hide the fact that it's barebones or an asset flip, so sad to see gaming consisting of titles like this. What's even more sad is that he actually hard-advertises one of his game, you stare at the poster of his game and you win. That's it. Also, about the last achievement, you can't get it. Completed the game 3 times (while I was waiting for the time limit to go) and you straight up just can't get it.",False,False

"You know what I was just thinking about a couple of days before I received this game in Curator Connect? ""I haven't heard from BMC Studios in a while... maybe the developer finally got the hint that I actually really hate his 'games'. Maybe he finally realized that I don't like him as a person through what he's portrayed with his 'games'. Thank god I haven't had to suffer through that trash in a long time"". Aaaaaaaaaand here we are. True story. It's like he read my mind and decided he hadn't sent me any spam keys in a while. I think what he does to me is part of the meme culture he embraces so much. I think he actually likes hearing from me. In case you haven't noticed, I loathe BMC Studios and we have a history that dates pretty far back... to their first release actually, when there actually was a ""their"" and not just a ""he"". So yeah, after his friends left the ""company"" this guy dropped out of college to pursue making this kind of garbage. The kind of elementary school trash that makes fun of people, but he tries to cover it up by acting like it's an ""accurate portrayal"" or some crap. If you need an idea, look at Coughing Simulator 2020. Gotta live that dank meme culture amirite. So, Not Well, it's supposed to be an interactive short film depicting someone who is severely depressed. Like everything else BMC Studios does, it's badly done in both context and execution. It's 20 minutes long, and you get to watch a guy sit at his computer and pathetically attempt to tear up his desk, chair, and phone without actually succeeding, then you get to watch him shower, then you get to watch him shave. Somewhere in there he pees and finds a hidden present. That's it. That is literally all this is, with a total of 3 interactions that let you ""keep your depression inside"" or ""express it"". Oh, and these options aren't even coded correctly... at least one of the ""express it"" scenes takes you to the ""keep it in"" scene. You had to code 3 things BMC Studios, three things. Let's move on to the film portion. In high school, I was taught about how long scenes were supposed to last, the rule of thirds, good transitional sequences, use of angles, etc. Either BMC Studios never took a film course in his life, or he just doesn't care. Seeing as you could teach yourself most of the aforementioned with some YouTube tutorials these days, I'm going to go with he just doesn't care to make anything that has any semblance of quality or value. With the exception of looking at him laying down in the tub all of the angles are straight on, and there are no transitions. There's nothing but stagnant 5+ minute long shots constantly. So unless you like to watch a guy shower, shave, pee, and sit at his computer then you're not going to have anything that even remotely resembles a good time here. It should also be mentioned that there's incontinuity regarding the tablet that's received as a gift later on. It's on the desk at the start of the ""game"". And the worst part of it all? This inaccurate depiction of depression that's only going to further the stigma that mental illness is only for crazy people and that depression always leads to self-harm. Not sure what he was going for here, the Curator Connect offer came with a note that mentioned something about how he felt when he was 15 and his dad died and he went through a short depression afterwards. However, as someone who has experienced extreme depression for most of their life, I can't say I've ever stared in the mirror and twitched around like a lunatic. Nor have I ravenously tore at my skin, and I especially didn't creepily kiss it after the fact. I've destroyed things in fits of depression-fueled rage, but we already went over how that wasn't executed properly. I mean, you could've at least gotten up and straight up destroyed something, but that would've required effort and energy. Everyone expresses their grief and depression differently, but overall Not Well doesn't depict any part of depression accurately; not its physical properties, its mental state, or even mental manifestations. It simply endorses the stigmas around depression, and that's why I think this is yet another meme culture poop smear on the Steam catalogue. Look man. I didn't like Kimulator, and I hate Not Well. I am a horror curator, and your ""games"" do not fit my demographic. You might find more people who actually like your work if you spend time sending your keys to appropriate curators. I've gone through this gradual progression of absolute scorn when it comes to BMC Studios, and it's at the point now where the next review will be the absolute bare minimum and a downvote.

"Game has potential and I'll still play it since the game is fun, and the mechanics of the game are already fantastic compared to other games, but with the metric ton of cash they have, it needs to go into fixing the game before content.

Microtransactions are unnecessary due to the sheer amount of sales that this game has, but are fine anyway as long as they do not affect gameplay. The cosmetics found in the crates aren't exactly the greatest looking, and you won't spend much time looking at them anyway since you'll be doing 360s attempting to scan the area. The RNG element is a little too strong. *65% of games you will have full level 1 for the first 10 minutes of the game with sparse meds and a red dot on an m16. 5% of games you have an 8x on a kar98k + full attachments + suppressor on SCAR-L or M416 with level 2/3 and too many meds to carry. Other times you have the inbetween. This is even worse in squad gameplay. Final Verdict: Save your money and watch how things play out.

"Recommend or not . . . Recommend or not . . . Hmm . . .  Even as I type my review, I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this game.  Did I enjoy playing it? Yes. Well, mostly.  Perhaps the tried-and-true Pro's and Con's list is the way to go.  Then we'll see where we land. So first, the positives: The art is pretty.  The backgrounds are vibrant and colorful.  The sprites themselves are beautiful, and the women are certainly attractive.  CGs are plentiful - especially given the length of the game.  There's obvious care and effort put into the artwork, but is that really enough? If you like Yuri, that's basically the whole plot.  Pumpkin is in love with her boss and wants to sleep with her.  That's essentially it.  I mean, there are some minor details in how we get to that point, but let's be honest; once you realize that's the objective, that's all most of us (guys) will care about.  Let's make it happen! On the negative, the story is insanely short. I was able to complete all the achievements in a little over an hour.  I'm a fast reader, but even still.  Many of them are for random choices in the middle of the game, so in essence there are actually only 4, or perhaps 5, endings. And one of those can be reached in 5-10 minutes. The translation is . . . wonky.  It's certainly not the worst I've ever played/read, but the grammar, verb tense, etc. is all over the place.  Now, I've had games with horrible english be almost a positive for me (check out my review for  ). But this is in that gray area.  It's bad enough that it's distracting to me, but not so far off that it's adorable.  If you're reading this VN in Russian, this obviously won't apply to you. In the end, I feel as though the playtime and general blandness of the story are enough to have me tell you to hold off on this one.  At $4, I'm not sure it's worth the money.  In a bundle, on a 75% sale, or received as a gift? Absolutely worth a playthrough.  But just the once when you have an hour or so to kill.  And you want to see green and purple nakedness. P.S. In the game, hit TAB then type the word 'code' to unlock the nudity options.  It's not exactly vital or game changing, but I mean . . . boobs . . . so . . . yeah.

"The game doesn't have much going for it. It sounded kinda interesting at first, but you quickly realize there is zero depth to the game. Leveling up in mining, for example, just yields more types of rocks you can mine, but doesn't improve the gameplay in any meaningful way. The monsters are pretty basic. Skills have long cooldowns and there isn't a terrible variety of skills you can use. Most skills just buff damage or something like that. The game is caught in a hard place, on the one hand, it wants to be a free form game, and on the other, it uses a silly level based tiering system. The two don't mix very well.

"This game looks fun until you play it. Its a repetitive shell of a game that looks promising. I wish I could give this a thumbs up and recommend it but I can't.

It's pretty fun to build and come up with different type of spaceships for mining, or killing an enemy. but it does get confusing because it doesn't hold your hand and explain everything. * Graphics and Frame rate. The Graphics are sharp and clean even the colors and how the neon lights of your ship glow as well as the particle effects. Frame rate does not take a hit at all. which I'm impressed especially if you build a giant monster ship or something. * Rogue like game play. I enjoy Roguelite games so the random loot for completing a mission is a plus.                                                                                       *The Bad* * Same 3 types of enemies. Ones that float and follow you, Shoot and chase you. Or stationary ones that shoot up in the sky like anti air. * Planets. I really hoped that this would have made the game but it doesn't all the planets are empty. there's some enemies on each planet but they feel hollow and I think it feels this way because of the missions. ( I'll explain this more below.) * The missions. What were they thinking? These missions are the same every time. Retrieve an item (Freezer Or ships blackbox) Kill or destroy Something. ( Corp transmitter, Hive, Overheating or pirate mines.)  Explore an area/planet. These should help each planet feel different but they don't. It just feels like you're doing the same thing every time you go to a solar system. * The soundtrack! Why did you guys choose those tracks? They sound grim and you'll hear the same track like 5 times in a row. This game should have an action/ creativity inspired track. *  If you put too many items on one part of your ship it'll wig out and start spazzing out so hard that literal parts of your ship will blow up. Not sure if this is a feature or glitch either way this is pretty lame considering that this game is about letting your imagination run wild.                                                                *Conclusion* This game would be good if it was still in Early access and if it was 10$ But I can't justify the 20.00$ Price point. You'll get a couple hours of fun out of this game but I can't see getting hundreds out of it. The game feels empty and repetitive. Even with the creative mode you'll get bored fast because there aren't that many scenarios to use your ship on. I'd rate this a 5/10 maybe a 6/10 if there were more missions and added more features.

"This is another one of theses cases where I really wish Steam reviews had a ""Thumbs sideways"" option. But since this isn't the case, I can't, in good faith, say I ""recommend"" this game, unfortunately. Which is a damn, damn shame. I really, really wanted to love this game, but I'm finding it very hard to do so right now. I like Momodora RutM a lot and I've been following this game since its announcement as Momodora V and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that it was. I felt really bad for rdein at the time, and was really glad when he managed to change the project around to become what we now know as Minoria, which at the time, looked really good. Now, I really love the theme of the game, I'm a big fan of anime nuns and the lore is interesting so far, the characters all look great. I genuinely love the visual style of this game and I do not believe it is a downgrade in comparison to RutM, just a different style that's not inherently superior nor inferior. The 3D models all look very cute to me and I love the backgrounds and the occasional 2D art, specially in the Fran chats. Although I do think some of the animations are a little less polished than RutM Exploration and platforming feel roughly the same to me, I think it's still fun and I really like the hidden walls in the game. I also was genuinely surprised to see different weapons with different combos, and I love how there's a trick with the RutM weapon to pretty much get a double jump, those little techs are always neat, even if unintentional However, where the game falls short to me, is in the combat, and it is the most relevant part to me. The most basic enemies in the game can take you out in 2 hits and the level up system feels pretty much irrelevant. It's very frustrating at time because the game simply doesn't do a very good job at all in giving you feedback for the damage you take. I died countless times because I ran into an enemy when I was already at half health, without even noticing it! Because I simply didn't think I would be at such a low health after only taking a single hit from another random enemy. Most of the time I actually died due to this rather than getting killed by a single enemy at once.  The issue here is mostly due to the fact that, again, the game simply isn't very good at making you FEEL that you actually took damage, and in turn it feels unecessarily punishing and awkward. If there was more visual aid and feedback, the enemies could even cause the same damage to you, but it wouldn't be so frustrating. (although I do think it's excessive to die in 2 hits to like the most basic mob in the game, and that should be looked into as well) I realize I haven't played much of the game and I'm not getting too deep into the mechanics here precisely because I don't have enough knowledge yet, but this was enough of an issue to me that I simply wanted to stop playing after 1 hour and a half or so. It was just really frustrating getting my progress stumped by what, to me, felt like very cheap deaths. I kinda get what experience they were trying to go after, but I think the game needed to be a lot more polished to provide for that. I think those things can be fixed, however, the devs are focused on bugs, and soft-locking or game-breaking glitches at the moment, which is understandable. But I do hope they address these issues eventually, because they truly hold back the game from being something potentially amazing, which it could have been. Ultimately, at its current state, I just find myself wanting to go back and play RutM, which I might actually do now, since I never got around to finishing that game. Which is a shame, I feel really sorry for not liking this game, because I know how the devs are proud of it, but I simply cannot ignore these issues, they genuinely damper the entire experience for me.",False,False

"It's very rare that I am unable to have at the very least a single praise for a game I don't like. Wow where to begin with this hot mess of a game.....I mean this game is bad and I mean REALLY BAD! The map designs feel like someone is just painting by the numbers adding in only the most basic and mundane boring, bland landscape imaginable. Oh let's not forget when I logged in for the very first time, I received a machine gun volley of invites from every single random person imaginable. I literally got 35 invites within the first minute of logging in which was enragingly annoying. I could not find the settings menu fast enough to turn off notifications. An option such as that should be turned off by default seeing how a new player could get spammed into the ground with invites before they even put their foot in the door.  My gosh never has a game had such atrocious hit detection/registry in all my years of gaming. Aiming in this game is a bad joke and attempting to aim with ironsights is just dogs***. I lined up a target in my ironsights, took precise aim at my oppenent's head and opened fire like crazy only to find out I DID NOT HIT HIM ONCE! So throughout the match I sat there trying to figure out where the hit detection/registry allowed me to damage my opponents. And of all the ridiculous solutions I've found this has got to be the worst. I found out how to make headshots in this game using ironsights. The trick is you don't aim for their head when trying to make a headshot (I know I'm just as confused and surprised as you are by that fact). You aim either at their crotch or the center of your opponent's chest to make headshots which is a**backwards and makes no sense what so ever. And then there is the blatant hacking in this game in which I gotta say wow. People who hack in this game are WAY TOO COMFORTABLE in cheating. From what I've seen these hackers walk around like ""Yeah I'm cheating....The f*** you gonna do about it?!"" In some instances they don't even try to hide the fact that they are cheating which is amazing in a depressing kind of way. Noticed a guy on my team straight destroying people on the other team with just a handgun all the way on the other side of the map. Not saying such a thing is impossible but to have such a high kill count with just a handgun shooting at extreme distances is not something a person can pull off constantly without cheating. But not to worry the other team had their own hacker(s) as well so I guess the equation balanced itself out in a kind of psychotic way. Shame on me for not noticing this sooner. I get rushed by a guy with a shotgun and realize that NOT ONCE during the entire match has he reloaded or ran out of ammo as he is rampaging around the map which is rather suspect if you ask me.  This game basically took all the elements people enjoy in shooter games and combined them together but their execution in designing around these concepts was done in a very mediocre manner. The problem with the designers is that they don't have a clear understanding of why people like or even enjoy these particular elements in the gameplay. I can only tell you about my personal experience and opinion with the game so if you're feeling brave enough to play for yourself (Who knows you miles may vary)",False,True

"EDIT: I've played longer than 2 hours. I've played 48 hours on Xbox One. That brings a total of 50 hours. So before you comment ""you'only played 2 hours"" please think again and realise Steam is not the only way to play games. I also state I HAD A LOT OF FUN IN ARK.  By all means a fun game with lots to do.  However, I do not accept paid DLC when in Early Access. I do not accept unnecessary price hiking and I certainly do not accept greed and milking the consumers for every little cent they have. We need to stand against this, being milked by dlc, season passes, pre order bonuses and suits who don't understand gaming from the consumer side of things. Suits that only have interest in figures and numbers. I have not bought DLC for a long time now and only plan to support DLC when it's needed WELL AFTER release date. A good example would be Witcher 3. As for day 1 DLC...Pfft. Will never touch with a barge pole. That being said, I love gaming, I grew up gaming and will be gaming till I die. I enjoyed triple-a titles only but all of the milking has turned me sour on AAA Games and I really don't enjoy them as much as indie games now.",False,True

"It was fun at first but after about 2 hours when you've managed to experience a big part of the combat it becomes apperant that the combat is more shallow than the older DMC games and way easier. Getting up to SSS rank in combat can be done by about 3-4 combos in large clusers. All in all the game isn't horrible but doesn't hold up if compared to other DMC games. If you've never played older DMC games or you're more of a casual player I recommend picking DmC up as an introduction to the series. If you're a veteran DMC player I'd recommend you pirate it and decide for yourself. It's very hit and miss for veterans but the key to enjoying it is to see it as a spinoff, not a true DMC game.",False,False

Also the devs care not for the long term players because they are more focused on how to rip people off with each dlc they bring out. DLCs on release are really good then the devs nerf the hell out of the killer or survivors perks or play style because of moaning newcomers screaming for nerfs to be done.

I did not get said reward so I had to contact customer support 4 days of them asking me to provide proof which I did they finally got back to me and said... Thank you for your patience. ROVER have checked their data and are now certain that all users who were entitled to receive their refunds have now had them. Unfortunately, if you still have not received these bloodpoints and shards, then this means you did not fulfil the experiment's criteria. There are several possible reasons for this: - You did not play the required number of valid games - You played multiple games with items/perks equipped - You disconnected too many times - You did not solo queue - You played on the ""live"" build, not the specific PTB environment - You were not invited to the test Their decision is final and we will not look to overturn this. I am sorry for any disappointment this may cause, but we are unable to assist you further with this query. So they ignore all the proof I sent them ie video evidence of all my games steam id and copy of my email and said we will ignore your proof and not pay you for your time you invested in us.

"edit: updating review. evidently its getting some attention, so I figured I might as well expand and clarify. tl;dr edition: neither good nor fun. do not buy unless its deeply discounted. I can not refer this game in good faith. There are 2 major things wrong with How to Survive. Firstly, take a look at the DLC. If How to Survive truly is an indie game, control of the project has been overtaken by greedhead corporate dumb think leadership. Someone (likely 505 Games) has opted to make DLCs out of basic features that should have been part of the basic game. Examples are an extra harder difficulty and a hardcore feature. Other DLCs (Heatwave) resemble what would have been unlockables for games only a generation ago. Lastly there are the DLCs that suggest the core game was released unfinished taking the cutting room floor scraps and selling them off as DLC when they got to them later. I don't know if the nickel and diming customers business model bothers you, but it sure as hell bothers me. The second problem is the game itself. Its not good. How to Survive is a perfect example of the tidalwave of schlock being put out by the burgeonning indie industry. It is an inferior imitation of mainstream titles like Diablo and Torchlight. It tries to be unique and original with additional survival features like hunger, thirst, and sleepiness, but they're implemented in a way that make the game tedious and annoying. The quality is painfully amateur and inconsistent. Struggle as a melee character, but have 2 triple bladed boomerangs and you're so golden the game gets dull. The content is particularly slim. Each island is painfully small. And the game itself manages to be as repetitive as Diablo and Torchlight, but in the most flat, boring, and completely unrewarding manner possible. How to Survive lives up to its lousy meta score. No idea why this game has such an overwhelmingly high positive customer review count. The $15 asking price with the lazy DLCs is crazy to me. Other games How to Survive is trying to be are the same exact price and offer more and better quality content minus the annoying survival gimmicks and DLC. Specifically either of the Torchlight games. Honestly, my recommendation is to not buy How to Survive at all. If you absolutely must take the plunge, as stated in the tl;dr above, buy it when its 80-90% off. That way you won't feel too ripped off when you find out how painfully below average it is.",False,False

"Recommend: Nope. Not even for .49 cents.  I've played a lot of indie B flick horror games cause I enjoy the genre. I figured negative reviews or not this would still have something to enjoy. I was wrong.  First I had to use third party software to lock the mouse to the game window to avoid my other 3 monitors but at least it did stretch to 2560x1080. Not that it helped visually. The game is dark and the flashlight doesn't seem to work as shown in screenshots.  A few comparison snips for your own judgement.  Definitely not the flashlight coverage shown in the store screenshots.  In a room with some chairs and a small TV.  The chairs in back light up from all angles, but the ones closest to me do not. Nor is there a ring of light as most dark games with flashlights.  Doors stand out pretty nicely as does blood splatter :D: but you can't see much in the halls to know where you can or can't walk. So lot's of getting stuck in objects as its just blackness.  Upstairs view next to a railing looking down at the bad guy. Makes finding his location nice, but you're still fighting the environment like Pitch Black or The Chronicles of Riddick :happypirate:  So getting past the visual, we have our bad   creature that chases you. Wow is he sensitive! If i moved before he came down the stairs and walked off in the opposite direction he was coming at me. Granted he is slow so you have that to your advantage. At one point he was upstairs and I turned my flashlight on downstairs and he came after me as well. So it seems even if it doesn't do much for you, it certainly helps to conclude your game faster.

"In this game you play the worst firefighter in the world.  The gameplay is awful, everything about this game is terrible.  Its a simple idea but with so little polish it still feels like an alpha build.  Oddly this game is a port from the Vita so one would think it would be a finished or better product for PC but its actually worse.  This game once it got greenlit literally became abandonware the next day with the devs vanishing never to return to the community or fix any of the issues of the game. This game has zero polish making it feel alpha.  The rooms have doors that are impossible to see without rotating the camera.  This could have been eliminated via putting breaks in the walls where a door is but instead they just gave up on game development.  Worse is that the door if you open it might kill you.  If there is any fire on a door it instantly kills the player.  This would happen alot less if we knew where the doors were.  This game has a time limit so all this camera sweeping to look for doors which could be anywhere takes alot of that time away which is gamebreaking for a game that requires a timer. This game you need to rescue civilians but they just fall over and die when entering rooms sometimes.  Other times there can be fire nowhere near them and they still just fall over and die.  One of the worst things is there can be civilians who want an item like a woman who wants her purse.  She will literally just stand in one spot and die if you dont bring her purse. The firefighter literally cant handle fire.  There can be a tiny fire in a room and the heat will build if you cant find it then you just die.  You can walk into a room for 2 seconds and die from the heat.  This firefighter literally has no protection at all.   The controls are terrible.  The camera moves using the same thumbsticks as rotating the character.  This makes playing the game a nightmare because you cant move the camera independently of changing your characters focus.  This could have easily been fixed by putting the camera on the right bumper and left bumper.  but why bother playing the game?  most devs dont they just make it completely clueless about game design being more code monkey than anything related to actual game making.  Anyone can make a game today, 8 year olds can and have and they work better than games like this. The WORST part of this game is if it just randomly deletes your game save.   This game is treated like garbage by the devs who just threw it on steam never bothering to fix anything making this game the literal garbage of steam and like all trash it should be removed from the steam store.

"Looking at game-play footage of this game, I was given hella ""EA Skate"" vibes, and that enticed me to buy it. I went in thinking I'd be playing it casually, however, after playing it for as long as I did, the best way I can describe it accurately is if Skate wanted to be the next Dark Souls and wanted to kick you in the nuts repeatedly while it was at it. It even makes it clear upon launching that the game will be unforgiving, which disappointed me on a casual level. The controls are off-putting--triggers to steer/turn your skater in the air, left stick to control front foot and right stick to control back, etc--and customization--in its current form--is hideously limited as it gives you a generic Skater to play as. Until this game gives you the option to have Skate-like controls--which I prefer over this clunky mess--I won't be picking this up again anytime soon. I'd gotten a refund after playing the game for 83 minutes, 20 or so of which were most likely after I'd finished the tedious, bone-grinding difficult tutorial. As it stands, I wouldn't get Session right now. First impressions are everything, and I was left with a bit of a sour taste just seconds into playing. I'd say give it a few months or so. If the game still isn't accessible for a casual audience by then, steer clear unless you want your face to meet with the pavement and run up that hospital bill. I cannot recommend this game to the casual gamer, such as myself. That's not to say I didn't have fun with it. On the contrary. I got used to the controls, but I could not grind to save my life.

"Here is the thing, It isn't exactly the game itself, as much as it is the community. When the game first came out, the community for it was amazing! Everywhere you looked, you could see a player in every map. It was a game where you had to work together to make any progress. You knew the big name players; FangBlade, Tigger, CurryIsHot, etc. The community was there. It was loving, it was caring, it was a game that you wanted to play with friends instead of alone. It wasn't so much how long it took to get somewhere, as opposed to how you got there. Now the game is just too quick and easy to do anything. There are far too many classes, and instead of using skills from each class; (for example, one of the most famous party quests, the Ludibrium Tower PQ, you NEEDED to have at least a magician and a thief in your party otherwise you could not complete the party quest) is now replaced with 'HEY I CAN BEAT EVERY BOSS IN THE GAME IN 2 DAYS BY MYSELF BECAUSE I BOUGHT NX'. It just doesn't have the same player base, and I believe that is the reason so many people are quitting. As someone who has played since 2006, these 10 years have really brought a change to my eyes on the game I once loved. Here are some key points: 1) The game is too rushed now. I know leveling slow sounds boring, but back in the day the excitement of getting to level 21 after hours of work so you can start Kerning PQing with your friends. Getting your 2nd job took work and then going to Ludi PQ was another fun adventure when you had friends to do it with. Getting tracks and looking for the best 'clicker' to get you into the PQs and what not. It was fun. Someone being level 70 back then was amazing. You'd look up to them. Now you can get it within 5 hours of playing hard. When Zakum first came out, for a long time there was a select few who could even dream about getting a zakum helmet, now everyone has one. 2) Pay to win. They added all this new stuff to upgrade your items like cubes and I don't even know what else. Back in the day the only thing that NX bought you was cool hair, clothes and pets. Now, if you wana be the best at this game, you have to pay a lot of money for it with cubes, and other NX items. 3) Simplicity. This is what is turning me off at the moment. Back when I played, there was only Mage, Bowmen, Theifs and Warriors (and the rare 'beginner' main), and it was awsome. Each class had strengths and weaknesses at different points in the game, and the world wasn't too gaint to explore. The old saying 'if it ain't broke don't fix it' I think. People enjoyed making one of each of the 4 classes (even more if you wanted Spearman, fighter, F/P mage, clerics, bandits etc). Now, when I opened maplestory, I see like 20 different classes at least, and each probably have their own sub-classes, it's just too much imo. Back then it was easy to balance (in fact they almost never had to balance any classes cause they were so equal) but, I imagine with this many classes now, sometimes they get out of balance and certain ones outshine heavily.",False,False

"I'd love to recommend the game but this wouldn't help 343 to add those missing features that are a huge flaw for a 2019's out PC game (won't come back to all the great work that has been done to it, but here are all the features but one that I'd have added in the game for it to be perfect in my eyes.) -Reporting people for bad or good behaviour, such things that are in game like CS GO or LoL... Doesn't help to get a better community, but it may help to at least make bullies and bad kids being together and people who are there to get fun together. So yeah, that'd require to rework matchmaking and stuff... -Being able to kick afk people who have put something on their mouse to spam left clic. And so a matchmaking during matches because when people leave or when you have afks in team... Well... You know that you cannot do a thing but try to kill people. Games with balls and such are not doable when you're the team down. -Season Pass progress through campaign... I dunno if I just didn't find the option, but when I enabled score or competitive score, it didn't progress the season pass, and that's annoying. I know it's mainly because Reach is my least favorite campaign, but it'd be great to progress through any kind of gameplay. -(from Hidden Xperia's videos) Getting off the controller's aim assist or having two different matchmakings with one enabled and one disabled. Or give mouse and keyboard aim assist too, LOL. (destroys the game for PC, can't make it with an aim assist, sadly). -(The one I'm not sure it's doable, but Halo would 500% get better with that) Custom crosshair. The one from the original game is so annoying because I love the cross or the dot... But this circle is just the worst crosshair I've ever experienced... How am I sure that with that circle I'm 100% on his head or am I praying gods that I'm high enough or centered enough... That's just a pain to play with this...

If your internet is sub-par, and you don't want to have to redownload the entire game every single time you want to play, then this game really isn't for you.

With my internet, that takes around 6 hours (download speed is just very slow, but I can play with low pings).

There are tons of things that have gone wrong with this game and they try to fix it by putting in new stuff that in return I think just jamms it up more to put it simply. If you dont have Premium then it is going to take you forever to get money up. There are constant Lag spikes and disconnections all across the game. People always saying something about there problems in game world chat do to servers and game glitches. The more they add and the more they dont fix problems at hand the worse the game will become. Sometimes you have to do a little evil for the greater good. You dont need wings to fly or rotors just rudders and thruster, or helium and thrusters. So people will make this small very strong ""thruster stick, box"" with tetra peices not touching but still connected and you can only break off peice by peice unlike regular robots.

"Textures clip, there are no interiors, no bots, the free-cam mode is nauseating, the lifeboats interact horribly with the player and I just expected a bit more from this. Maybe it was naivety from the fact I am somewhat of a Titanic enthusiast and I was too arrogant to accept the reviews before playing it myself or maybe I wanted to just see why this game has such a divisive review score but what I do know is that buying and playing this game was a waste of my time. There are no interiors in this game. You cannot go inside the ship. Heck, you can't even walk down the two of the sets of stairs near the middle of the ship underneath the third funnel because the frame is too low down for your character to fit through! I was very disappointed in this aspect because I was expecting to be able to 'relive the experience' as it says on the header image and not just see the outside decks. I wasn't expecting a huge story and immense unreal engine 4 graphics but I just expected a little more than what I actually got. I understand that this is a small company and things like modelling the entire inside of the ship and NPCs and such are outside the budgeting range but you cannot make claims of reliving the experience when that is not what you have created. I don't feel that it is necessarily disrespectful to the survivors of the event but I do feel it is disrespectful to the consumers of the product. The lifeboats work and do their job. I have no issue with the lifeboat itself, just how it interacts with the player. The lifeboats will sometimes knock the player out of the boat from moving too fast in comparison to the player's own speed in keeping up or the boat's seats will trap the player between them and it will make a horrible and irritating collision noise. Both these problems could be easily fixed by just providing an option to actually sit in the boat. The free-camera is extremely awkward and difficult to control. It sways so much and just does not feel fluid at all. I was able to get some nice screenshots though once I was able to tame the free-cam and get it to where I wanted it though so this is more of a moot point.  The mouse constantly disappears and renders the menus unusable (first noticed this after the titanic sank and I was sent back to the main menu but started to occur more frequently and in more places upon starting again). Annoyingly, the camera also follows the mouse (when it works) in the pause menu.  There is no quit to main menu. This is more of a point of convenience rather than something that affects gameplay but I still feel it is worth mentioning because it was quite annoying having to quit to desktop and relaunching the game every time I just wanted to return to the menu.

"Hidden Objekt Game von 2017. 1.650tes Review in meinem Archiv. Du übernimmst die Rolle einer Mutter auf der Suche nach ihrer entführten Tochter. Mary kam mit ihrem Mann und ihrer Tochter auf der Suche nach ihren längst verlorenen familiären Wurzeln auf diese abgelegenen Inseln. Die Umgebung ist sehr schön gemacht und spielt in den verzauberten Tälern der vergessenen Indus-Zivilisation. Dies ist das mit Abstand beste Spiel seiner Art, was das Gamplay betrifft, das ich kenne. Besonders Lobenswert ist die Logische gut platzierte Abfolge der einzelnen gesuchten Objekten.    Leider kommt es an zwei Stellen zu kritischen Systemabstürzen. siehe beigefügten Fotos. Beim ersten kommt es zum Absturz wenn man auf die Hilfe klickt bevor es Aktiv ist. Kann also vermieden werden, jedoch weiß ich nicht ob dies nicht auch an anderen Orten der Fall ist. Beim zweiten liegt es am Minispiel - Früchte ernten. Leider braucht man die Früchte um weiter zu kommen im Spiel. Somit ist hier das Spiel zu Ende für mich. Ich habe es 5x komplett bis dahin Probiert. Die Abstürze als solches wären ja nicht all zu schlimm aber die Speicherdaten sind beschädigt (an mehreren Stellen) was dazu führt das sie Automatisch Gelöscht werden. Was sinnvoll ist aber so musst du halt von Beginn an neu Spielen.   Die Fehler im Spiel sind schon seit langen Bekannt, wie ich der Community entnehmen kann. Jedoch scheint es Spieler zu geben die angeblich keine Probleme haben. Wie dem auch sei, so kann ich es nicht empfehlen. Da ich alle Daten zum Spiel den Entwicklern gesendet habe hoffe ich sehr das sie eine Lösung zu diesem Problem finden. Ich habe es in Deutsch gespielt laut Community ist dies aber auch in der englischen Version der Fall.   Wegen diversen Systemcrash Ereignisse - Nicht Kaufen! Meine Gruppe und mein Archiv mit über 1.650 Reviews hier: 👑 Powered by HoI 4 Deu  Kuratorengruppe auf deutsch/englisch 👑 ⠀⠀⠀🎉    und mehr Reviews von mir entdecken 🎊 Mein Dank an den Herausgeber,  der mir dieses Spiel zum Testen, überlassen hat. Hidden Object Game from 2017. 1,650th review in my archive. You take on the role of a mother in search of her kidnapped daughter. Mary came to these remote islands with her husband and daughter in search of their long-lost family roots. The environment is beautifully done and takes place in the enchanted valleys of the forgotten Indus civilization. This is by far the best game of its kind in terms of gamplay that I know of. The logical, well-placed sequence of the individual sought objects is particularly praiseworthy.   Unfortunately, there are two critical system crashes. see attached photos. With the first one it comes to a crash if you click on the help before it is active. So it can be avoided, but I don't know if this is not the case in other places as well. The second is the mini-game - harvesting fruits. Unfortunately, you need the fruits to advance in the game. So the game is over for me here. I have tried it 5 times completely by then. The crashes as such would not be too bad, but the saved data is damaged (in several places) which leads to it being automatically deleted. Which makes sense, but you have to play again from the beginning.   The errors in the game have been known for a long time, as I can see from the community. However, there seem to be players who allegedly have no problems. Anyway, I don't recommend it like that. Since I have sent all the game data to the developers, I very much hope that they will find a solution to this problem. I played it in German, according to the community, but this is also the case in the English version.   Due to various system crash events - do not buy!

"Very bad impression in first few games.. Simply put its gameplay trash compared to FIFA, there's no control on ball whatsoever, no fluidity.. players take so much time to pass the ball that it gets snatched if you pass it in the last moments... only bcoz your player took too much time to pass the ball.. even when you pressed the button earlier. No proper responsiveness. Also it feels like controls are messed up, there's no accuracy on ball control, you do one thing but sometime you end up off the target bcoz of either inaccuracy or slow responsiveness. When you want to shoot the ball in the net after a pass through, your shot button will only response when your striker catches up & touches the ball, only then your player will prepare to shoot... which takes too much time to take the shot, obviously you don't have that much time your opponent's goal territory. If you press shoot button early (even while you are about to catch up the ball), even if your player is a few inches away from ball, your striker will give up the ball & let it go to either goalkeeper or outside, missing a very good opportunity to score as if player is not interested in scoring the goal at all... All bcoz of the lack of responsiveness OR gameplay mechanics are like this. Only graphics are ""slightly"" better than FIFA but i doubt anyone cares about graphics in a Football game, all that matters is a football game is ""gameplay"". And yeah these are the things i have observed in 3-4 games in just 50 minutes of gameplay.. i felt the difference right away compared to FIFA. FIFA is wayyyy much better, either in terms of responsiveness, accuracy, fluidity, moves, online system (Ultimate Team) etc..",False,False
Rating: 2/5 I brought this game because of the overwhelming amount of positive reviews but it turns out to be disappointing. The kind of game play it has reminds me of games I used to play on mobiles 10 years back. And I wonder what made developers to think of such old mobile  gaming concept to PC. I've only played this for few hours but I already feel kinda bored.  First of all you play the game viewing from top. So you cant even see characters properly. Secondly almost 80% of game is you driving around and racing. The rest of the game is blowing ♥♥♥♥ around and stealing things. All that driving around and navigating is already putting a strain on my hand and that's exactly what I hate about these top view games. Some people might find this game interesting but this is not for me.,False,False

"At first glance a nice game with nice elements. However, there is no catchy storyline and everything is the same from start to finish. Stupid shooting seems like the only goal, but finding hidden rooms and items is challenging! For those who like that and make no further demands, this might be a great game. Since everything is the same, it gets very boring halfway through so I no longer enjoy the gameplay. As a result, you simply sit down and shoot to finish the game as quickly as possible. The gameplay also offers a number of options to improve your performance and skins, but given the monotonous nature of the game and the boredom that it causes, it is not a challenge for me to work on it any longer. In short, for me a game that you play once and then never again.",False,False

"TL:DR Game is nowhere near worth it's amount and has many problems that should be fixed. I rarely ever write reviews for the games I play whether I enjoy or hate them but given the circumstances for this game in particular, a review is a must. And from what I've played, this game is absolutely garbage. This game is a DEATHMATCH style moba, not a King of the Hill. You fight against 7 other opponents in a battle to the death. You have 4 lives. Last person left standing is the winner. Let's start with the classes. There are four classes in the game at the moment which consists of your generic Knight, Archer, Axeman and Mage. These classes are extremely unbalanced and the Knight class will win in a fight almost every single time. Playing a class such as Archer will only net you kills is if your enemy has noticeably health than you or you're not being directly targeted. You're also given no description of any of the classes, it's abilities, DPS, speed, or anything. All there is to see is the look and name of your character doing a certain animation. I'm not sure if I missed it during the loading times or anything but there seemed to have not been any proper place to select my character other than clicking on them in the profile screen then joining a queue, which forced me to play Archer the whole time whether I wanted to or not. Once you actually get yourself into a match, you'll find how dull the music is and how cheap and repetitive the sound effects are with the only thing keeping me playing is the cluster♥♥♥♥ of people going at it and getting some cheap kills at the knights before dying to one yourself. The majority of the content really is killing others until they run out lives, which isn't bad but isn't really good either. When the match is over, the back to main menu button is temporarily disabled.....HOW DOES THAT MANAGE TO OCCUR??!?  But for all I saw that is bad, there are a few pros being the controls feels really for how it plays although the buttons on the main menu is a bit iffy at times. The animations graphics are also pretty decent except the ones again in the main menu. And these are my opinions on the game I had created when I had started up and played for the first time.

"The gameplay of this game is nice, you can do some really crazy stuff with it, however, it's very scarce and simple in comparison to the non-reboot games in the series, specially 4 and 5. And the inclusion of a button to dodge just feels...weird with this type of game too. The combo system is a tad broken, as you only need to switch between 1/2 moves apparently before you can repeat the other. And I don't have to mention that the story is horrible, right? Cause it's not news at this point. It's practically your generic trope of protagonist, secretly bad guy but  , terrible sidekick. You can see the story from miles away, specially if you played the original games. It almost feels forced. But at least the final fight is very satisfying(until you have to figure out you need Devil trigger to finish it.) The Vergil's DLC is more acceptable, but Vergil has a moveset that is very small for you to consistently combo without getting your ass capped by an attack. But it's not a surprise, since you only need to use 2 combos to even do a S Rank.",False,False

"Initially was a positive review... Changed this to reflect latest 20MB patch which now only allows 8 clicks per second when using auto clickers Devs somehow think people don't use auto clickers to play games like this? so my almost 700 hrs game time has been wasted, forced to use money because paywalls have been put in place. No where do devs stipulate you cannot use an auto clicker For an EA game this isn't the smartest thing to do, you've just gone and changed the rules when the game was hard enough as it was Game is ruined now... Totally avoid this game, you're going to spend months getting anywhere or you will be forced to spend real money EDIT so I decided after what I consider a completion of the game, to post my thoughts 1st things 1st, devs do respond to things that are broken, so if things have happened to you in game where money is involved or not, they will personally fix this, I like this and praise the devs for this care and attention: this is where the praise ends unfortunately So the game i have now clocked up 900+ hours and I found while it kept me occupied, there was very little to do that was rewarding. I was an active player so used an auto clicker (I advise to use one and it's not cheating as some suggest), the game stalls for some reason and I don't think the migration from Mobile platform to PC has worked well in favor of devs So you can complete this game without money and what I mean complete is 100% achiements, after that there is no real reason for me to continue It's a lot of time and I personally would not do this ever again, but the timing was right and I had spare time based on certain personal goals being achieved, given I pooled my efforts into this (being a fan of the TV show caught my attention so thought any meme could be a good meme). I soon recognised how much effort was required to get my 100% fulfilment, this was a social experiment gone horribly wrong, things changed in the game that made progression feel retarded, held back So I have already posted how auto clicker was nerfed, that wasn't so much an issue as the events were, which became a distraction of the main task, which is for me 100% achievements So these events, while had some nice extras, really all they do is hold you back from doing what youo're supposed to be doing, and it adds up to 125hrs? to the whole dynamic, and yes it's become weekly I don't like how the game has changed so rapidly like things have just been added to please the few paying customers? I don't know and I am not accusing, but asking a question, it just feels that a minority here is being catered for, ie the paying player that can and will get what they pay for, which is obviously an advantage, it doesn't mean non paying players are at a disadvantage, it means that that aspect of the game is being neglected The game is designed to create revenue, cash cows it needs to move to fiscal targets to be succesful Most players (this is an opinion) do not spend money so the driving force of this game, you guessed it is money Devs can do what they want, as long as there is a way of 100% achievements without money, I am all good for that, what doesn't gell well is when devs change the focus of the game mid way, or early on and these changes affect in my eyes the monetary value of the game I will explain, certain things early on which people spent money on changed to where newer players could potentially have to spend more money on or less, given the dynamics have changed Not good Also the fact of the matter that these things should have been worked out in EA, not full release which makes spending money in this game a bit of a gamble, to which my last point's measure This game with money becomes a bit of a gamble as you really do not know what you're getting when you buy the packs, there is not enough consistancy as you cannot sell anything you acquire, other than the cards you get (this is the bonus), but one player might spend more money achieving the same results as another, to me which is too random /TL:DR oh well, such is life... __________________________________________________________________________ I will leave everything here, BUT add that the devs actually do care about their community If I could leave a nuetral review, I would, but alas I cannot There has been some toxic behaviour in threads which devs have stated that using an auto clicker is NOT against ToS The devs are right in posting this and posted due to concerns of the players that use an auto clicker...

"First things first, Unity 3D. Who thought this was going to on the Unity 3D engine? Anyone? Nope. Why is it on the Unity 3D engine? Who knows. Whoever made that decision is the reason why this game has such horrific reviews. The animations, Frame Rates and over all clunky feeling the ENTIRE game has is most likely due to the engine being Unity 3D. Watch as you get a solid maybe 70 frames, then your sensitivity will skyrocket as your FPS dips to like 20 and it picks it back up. I ran this game in 1440p, on the lowest settings with a 2080TI and the entire time the game is open your GPU will be hard stuck at 99% usage the entire time this game is open.  Thats the Unity 3D engine for ya. Second stop on this ride is the Animations. A disaster in itself. NONE of the animations I saw ran smoothly/correctly. Many times your gun (Especially the magnum) will clip back to the last frame of the shooting animation, so it just jitters back and forth sometimes. The enemy movement is choppy, and whenever you kill anyone they all to the SAME EXACT death animation every single time. Think of a T pose, but with them holding a finger pistol and then just toppling over. On every single enemy. Completely ruins the immersion every time you kill someone. In a nutshell this is how animations are -   : 3 minutes of just WTF. Basically in the entire game Graphical wise - I didn't see many issues. It looked good when standing still, hence why the screenshots make the game look amazing on the store page.  AI in this game is also just a mess. I played on the second to last hardest difficulty. So basically hard, and in-between trying to aim correctly with the   and messed up animation you can basically just click once on their head and their dead. I barely ever even checked my health unless I was getting sniped, without the snipers and bazookas the damage input to you is next to nothing. I played up until the mission where you go into the tent to bug the guys office. No matter what I did, I always failed the mission as soon as I planted the bug. I hid bodies, did everything but as soon as the guy spawns in it was game over. After 2 tries at that, I gave up and started writing the review. In a nutshell, I do not see many of these issues getting fixed with the current engine and I do not ever see this game going above ""Mixed"" reviews on steam. Why they thought this was ready to roll out as a completed game is beyond me and is now on my list for THE worst remake I have ever played. For a full playthrough of what I painstakingly went through, you can watch the stream and click anywhere in the video to see this game in its full, depressing glory. By about minute 10 I realized I was in for a treat, and now cannot refund due to steams 2 hours rule.  My playthrough -  Some dumb lookin deer that just stood there and did nothing, but I remember it being in the original with animations. Just a derp deer -",False,False
"First things first: What is XIII? A stylish and compelling FPS. While it doesn't exactly make any enourmous improvements to the genre, the story element is strong and the comic - style gameplay is truly enjoyable, even today! Multiplayer is another string to this games bow but hardly cutted. Overall this is a slick, enjoyable game so far (ONLY STORY WISE) - well worth owning and the multiplayer will hold your interest for ages. You are the victim of a conspiracy! Find your way out and uncover the mysterys behind the assassination of the President of the United States, William Sheridan. His death is a nod similar to real-life former President John F. Kennedy who was killed by a sniper bullet to the head in Dallas in 1963. The downside so far: No Bots and only two game Modes (Deathmatch and Team-Deathmatch), while the Original had way more. Plus the Maps are also cutted. A huge let-down in regards to the Multiplayer - but still enjoyable if you're looking for Singleplayer... but thats no the only con sadly... The biggest let-down: Multiplayer is not working as of now. You can select a Character but not go ingame LOL!!! This is a stylish and fun game that sadly did not get the recognition it deserved. Too many reviews gave it a thumbs down because it ""wasn't as good as Halo."" back in the days... Well, it wasn't trying to be Halo. Very well written, XIII has a compelling story that will keep you interested and guessing all the up until the cliffhanger ending. The music is superb, the voice acting is good, the cell-shaded graphics are very cool, and it is a very fun game to play. Some folks may not like that you can't save anywhere and that it builds up on ""checkpoints"" which are not that well placed. but that is sort of par for the course for Ubisoft of that time period. I highly recommend it. After all the games I've played so far, this is still one I think of fondly and plan to play again. Plus there are grappling hooks! The Downside: It also has some bugs (Not gamebreaking ones) in the Campaign. - Aiming is reaaaally slow while holding right click (You can watch around pretty smoothly but aiming is just slower settings-wise). Problem is: You can't change that (Not as far as I'm aware of) - Sounds are copy and pasted from the original (To keep the feeling in a newer and fresher look) and I like that! I dont need new voice actors because you know it as much as I do. As soon as your lovely series / show gets a new voice actor you immediately recognize it and don't like the show anymore. XIII Doesn't have that problem - There are a few frame-rate issues especially in the Bank Level. - No Ultrawide Support (4k etc.) - After the flashback on the beach, when it took me back to the beach from the boat I was greeted to the lifeguard having no pupils for half a second before her eyes rolled back onto their spot. - High Temps and might be unoptimized (You can see the typical outrage in the forums already) The last point is why I'm giving it a thumbs down. I play at 144hz @1440p and it should not be possible to overheat a 2080Ti with a Game like this while I Play everything else with 40-50 Degrees. There are also collectables (golden statues) to find all around the Level and it gives you extra content to find. It overall looks pretty good. Just do us all a favor:",False,False

"Yeah, my playtime is low but there's a number of reasons for that, including dropping Windows 7 support requiring some jiggering to play it and simply not being interested in what the game has become. I purchased this game based on the product that it was... 6 yearss ago, and the roadmap supplied that continued it down an action rpg road that I really liked the look of, and I really enjoyed the alpha, then I shelved it since I expected updates to come and I didn't want to burn out... and then nothing happened, for years. Cut to January of this year and the developer put out another little bit of information as he had come to do every 6-12 months and the game was still moving towards what the roadmap outlined. Again cut ahead a few months and you land with the announcement of the game actually being released and I was excited, then I looked deeper and found that the game had had nearly every feature stripped from it to a barebones quasi-rpg with no true progression, no procedural worlds, no skill trees and on and on. I was unimpressed, and so was most of the community surrounding it. I'm not going to make this about the politics of what happened then but I will say that this was a game I liked, and now it is not and I cannot recommend it. You can find plenty of information on what happened and what changed elsewhere and have no doubt seen it already if you're read this far.

"The line puzzles, for what they are, are fairly inventive despite the limitations. Each area of the game introduces new concepts into the maze puzzles, and many of the harder puzzles merge a variety of these concepts together. Over the course of the game you will gradually learn this language so you will be able to intuitively understand these puzzles, although they will always remain a challenge. Some of the later puzzles are fiendishly challenging, which will leave you reaching for a guide. After the tutorial area of the game, you can wonder across the Myst-esque island at your leisure, and some areas of the island are clearly meant for you to complete after you've finished some of the easier areas. However, the game never tells you ""you don't know how to complete this puzzle yet"", which can lead to frustration if you attempt a series of puzzles you haven't mastered the rules of. Furthermore, some of the puzzle design can be counter-intuitive; certain puzzles are able to be brute forced by process of elimination, and if you’ve missed environmental clues or other hints, or simply don’t understand what you’re supposed to be doing, these do not feel very fun. Indeed, a lot of the game can feel deliberately un-fun. The game doesn’t have any kind of traditional reward structure; by completing puzzles you simply unlock more puzzles, but don’t get any kind of feedback other than that. You get your enjoyment through the act of solving the puzzles themselves, instead of any external validation. There are also a lot of optional puzzles that essentially do “nothing”, and completing them is not required to “finish” the game. Visually the game is without fault, with a gorgeously lush and colourful world with various biomes including a swamp, a town and a desert. Each area feels nicely distinct, while nonetheless integrating into the rest of the world. However, the island is most of the time completely disconnected from the puzzles you’re actually solving, meaning it functions mostly as a pretty backdrop. There are only a couple of areas where the environment is used in conjunction with the puzzles (such as the mazes in the castle) and these are definite highlights. While there are some ambient noises, the game is completely lacking any soundtrack or music, something I think is a great shame considering the excellent use of music in the lead developer's previous game, Braid. I liked certain things about The Witness; its gorgeous visuals and the fairly interesting puzzles. But what makes me feel so infuriated by it is that philosophically and intellectually the game is a mess, and it does not have its own voice at all. Instead, it simply borrows from other philosophical traditions and introduces them without any preamble in an attempt to appear “deep”. It also has essentially no story or in-universe justification to speak of at all; any story must be inferred from a secret ending that occurs after you finish the game the first time. Rather than advancing or suggesting some themes, The Witness cribs wholesale from the work of others. If you go to the trouble of hunting them down, there are several videos that you can watch in the underground cinema. These videos are from third-party sources and suggest several different philosophical viewpoints, but there is no analysis of their validity, or exploration of their content. One goes on for over an hour and is a complete waste of your time. You’re just presented the videos and left to work out how you feel about them on your own. The audio logs, which are the other main collectible, are just out of context quotes from a variety of philosophers, scientists and theologians, stuffed into the game seemingly without rhyme or reason. They’re clearly designed to show you different “viewpoints” and to show how different people see things differently, but that is a theme that can be summarized in a single sentence. The Witness doesn’t have a clue what it’s trying to say apart from “people see things in different ways”; it honestly feels like these audio logs were put into the game simply to give the player something to find when they’re not solving puzzles, and to pepper the sometimes unnervingly quiet island with sounds. The Witness wants you to think there is some deeper meaning here; it wants you to think about the stone figures and the island and question it all, but there are no answers and it’s completely pointless. The Witness is a bit like a dolls house. It's beautiful but it’s lacking any kind of soul, and beneath the surface you can see the fake wallpaper and the plastic furniture. Emotionally, The Witness is cold as ice and the island, despite its beauty and colour, feels uniformly lifeless, artificial and empty. I came away from The Witness actively disliking it; scorning it for its blasé, meaningless attitude actively wishing it had had “something” interesting to say. The Witness desperately wants you to think it’s clever and that it has hidden depth, but ultimately it’s a lie. It’s just a pretty game with some line puzzles in it, and nothing stringing those two elements together. That’s fine, but it should come clean rather than hiding itself behind obfuscating layers of pretension. The Steam store page for The Witness says   This is just one of several blatant lies that pepper the store page, which you will discover as you play. The Witness downright revels in wasting your time, sometimes in infuriating ways. I can only recommend The Witness to people who enjoy solving line maze puzzles for the sake of solving line maze puzzles, but I cannot recommend it to anyone looking to intuit any greater meaning, purpose or enjoyment from it other than that.",False,False
"The main notable problem is the developers abandoned their game and I never knew about it when I had purchased the game a year and a half ago. The graphics and the mechanics/gameplay of the game are pretty fine, could've been improved drastically if the developers hadn't determined to give up on their game.  Second major problem is -teaming- among ""The killer and the counselors"" is unpreventable and most likely to happen since the players still not considerate enough to be fair/decent to everyone, which actually leads to my third point about their excessively toxic and disproportionate way of communication and behavior that frustrate many and ruin their gaming experience. My advice and solution here is to mute this kind of players immediately as soon as you notice you're with them.

"I understand that the ""Adult Only"" Can give out quit a 'shock' to most audiences, making some people (like me) more interested in playing it. But all honesty this demo is nothing more than a glorified quest go-fetch-this-that puzzle. I Genuinely don't see the horror aspect of the game at all, i haven't been scared once.. And yeah, the sex scenes are even more bland (I don't want to lie and say that i wasn't interested in the game because of them as-well).. But its basically just clicking and hitting a white part of a circle type-of-minigame, and said minigame helps you progress in the game by teleporting you to the other weird dimension where you have to do even MORE go-fetch puzzles. The plot is interesting but really damn weak and unrealistic, at the beginning of the demo my attention was caught due to the somewhat unique atmosphere..But my enthusiasm quickly dissipated once i noticed the chores the player has to follow and the bad level design that pushes you to walking over and over and over again around the theatre without anything interesting happening except 2 bland jumpscares The combat system is buggy and sometimes hits dont sync.  The optimization of the game is unexistent and lazy. I was expecting more than a puzzle fetch game, i understand this is a demo but i'll be honest -- If the real game is going to be like this, then i'm not interested. Despite my annoyance i completed all the puzzles and well, the voice acting in the secret room once you hear the recording was pretty good and alluring to the story, so i'll give you that.

"There is a mining colony at Alpha Prime,  for Hubbardium. A mysterious mineral that is greatly sought after. Somehow  used as a chemical and recreational drug. The initial cutscene shows miners drink it like beer. Large amounts can drive man insane and that leads us to our main character Arnold Weiss. A 50 year old man, that can drink Hubbardium beer without getting intoxicated. And yes, he does drink anyway. It's not like smokers do it for the thrill of getting cancer, right? More importantly he is the only person that can take concentrated amounts and enter a slow mo state, without the inconvenience of losing his sanity. I know a hero when i see one and this one is no less than perfect for the job at hand, meaning finding the source of this mineral before the main villains. And surprisingly enough the men were right. There was indeed a not so natural source that transforms rock into Humbbardium. Workers calling it the heart of Glomar,now that is suspicious.  Conforming this conspiracy, would often be enough reason for a character. However for Arnold, this 90s badass, couldnt care less. All he wants his to rescue his ex´s boyfriend in a way that proves himself the superior male. Dont tell me, i know...so relatable. This is all i know for story, i just couldn't help myself and skipped most of overexposure and redundant dialogue. except for the Italian guy, he was great, what a voice actor! it manages to be the most inaccurate representation of an Italian, while still sounding italian. You could get similar results by getting an Italian to play an american. Its where all the fun is. Alpha Prime is an incompetent corridor shooter, with a few interesting ideas and mechanics. These mechanics exist in a not so polished game that can not accommodate them. But they are there to use at your own free will. There's just something genuine to this game. The level design is claustrophobic. The corridors give a helping hand against aimbots, and mitigate the damage AI could do in more open areas. However it offers none of the strategy you would see in F.E.A.R. It's a frantic shooter where no one is taken by surprise, you cut a corner and try shoot first. At most you get some areas where enemies are scripted to always act the same way, while breaking a window or moving back to their squad, these are scripted events, not part of the AI strategy. They are incapable of reacting to any encounter without shooting on sight. Never seen them run away from grenades, never seen them flank. When a door is locked, even if aggro all they can do is shoot at it. All they can do is find cover, sort of. It's not like they needed the help, AI is fast and accurate and that is enough to deal a good amount of damage. Rather than fixing the AI, the gameplay revolves around dealing and receiving a fair amount of damage, which the developers balanced by inserting Health stations everywhere, sometimesmore than one per room. Quick save also helps. SLOW MO, gets trivialized, it helps you shoot more times per second.  but it's fun to use, in fact it makes the game playable. The most fun to use, is HACKING, which is sadly forgotten as it does not match fast flow of the combat, unless it's strictly necessary or your met with a difficulty wall, it doesn't get much use. It is unfortunate it's the best mechanic in the game, and it can be used to your advantage outside opening locked doors and moving forklifts. you can analyze rooms and hack robots, and its enjoyable. PLATFORMING - yeah, so the physics in this game are floaty, it's easy to slide off platforms, jumping near boxes kill momentum or worse, send you flying backwards. thankfully it's not something you have to do often. i'm going to highlight the flamethrower as one of the worst examples ever made. It's a random weapon with a short area damage, it doesn't lit the environment on fire, it doesn't have a burn stat on enemies, it doesn't stagger. what it does have is a fixed amount of damage for as long as the enemies is in its short range. Its not the most underpowered weapon, but it sure puts you really close to an enemy that can still shoot you point blank. The hammer is ridiculously fast, but close range combat is deadly against aimbots The sniper doesn't get much use, it could be worth it if either, damage was increased or the zoom animation wasnt as long as it is. It's a strange inclusion considering even the open areas don't have the long range combat to make it a necessity, You will find the pistol is incredibly accurate for the job at hand. The Shotgun! the shotgun is rather good in this. Probably not that surprising if they were influenced by FEAR. it's a mixed bag, the art style is not entirely awful, it's more the quality of the faces and some textures that don't look particularly great for 2007. While weapons and the interiors look much closer to average. Increasing the FOV to 90 seems to bring a few graphical glitches and cant find a command to change the weapon FOV. i would advise keeping it closer to 80. The final boss is a victory lap after a hard game, more accurately multiple laps around the room. It's easy and generally badly design, though that happens quite often with fps with only one or two bosses, its almost like they felt the need to include one, despite having no ideas and pattern recognition for them",False,False

"So this game has SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO man problems. 1st (which JUST happened to me), is I got a 30 min ban for bs. Your supposed to get banned if your kill a team mate off the start. My friend was killed off the start, so fast that I don't even think the game rendered that he was killed in the time that you could get banned, which is off the start, so I killed the guy that killed my friend, and I got banned, but the other guy didn't. This is so dumb. Granted I only got a 30 min, so it's not that bad, but if he was banned, then I wouldn't be in this position. This isn't the only problem. It's also super easy to get hacks. It's also super easy to make a new account if your other account was banned for hacking, and just start hacking again. You can never escape hackers in this game. Buying prime just makes hackers harder to find, but you will still find hackers no matter what you do. This game needs so much work, that the work most likely won't be done.

"I am so disappointed with the developers of Undead Souls. I'd had this title on my wishlist for a while now, so when I saw it at 90% off the $9.99 price tag today, I didn't even hesitate. Apparently, I should have. Now, it's important to note that I hadn't read anything about asset flips or the poor reviews from Gun Brothers and Massive, so I really went into this blind and optimistic. I love a well-done roguelike, and top-down twinstick shooters are my jam, so I was expecting one thing but got something else entirely.  My major gripe with Undead Souls is that it's completely unplayable. I found the controls to be unresponsive with a notable delay between button presses and action. However, the swarming opponents have no such delay in their activity and made short work of my 7 hit points, usually before I'd even realized that I'd been hit with something. To say that opponents are seriously overpowered under the circumstances would be a tragic understatement.  The starting angel character fights with a sword, but the player still utilizes twinstick combat to aim in the direction of the swing. Unfortunately, hitboxes seem to be out of whack, because try as I might, I only connected about half the time. I stuck it out long enough to unlock the jester character, thinking that maybe a projectile weapon would even the odds a bit, but it did no such thing. Graphics and sound didn't even rate as mediocre. In fact, while I was playing, or attempting to play, those weren't even tracking for me. I had to go back in and pay close attention to even determine that they weren't worth my time because I was so overwhelmed and frustrated trying to get the mechanics to work. I was able to alter the zoom and disable screen shake, but that made little to no difference in gameplay for me. Under no circumstances can I recommend this game, not even at the 99 cent price I paid today. In fact, I'm submitting my refund request to Valve for this unplayable game the very second that I publish my review. With titles like Nuclear Throne, Enter the Gungeon, Streets of Rogue, Gatling Gears, Crimson, Feral Fury, NeuroVoider, Zombie Party, Hero Siege, Kill to Collect, Android Cactus, Utopia 9, Necropolis, Crypt of the NecroDancer, Dead Cells, and Full Mojo Rampage, you're sure to find a worthy roguelike or twin-stick shooter for your library.

"This review will focus only on the Battle-Royal mode of the game.

Now while csgo's BR is not my cup of tea it is unique and that's all it really has going for it. and that's also not saying much since game like fortnite can also be considered unique with it's building and colourfull artstyle. If you're not good at CS gameplay and don't want to put in the time to learn, you're going to have a bad time. The reason I bring this up is because games like fortnite and blackout are really easy to pick up and play.

"Foundation is the perfect title for the game, why? Because it literally has a good foundation but everything is very early access; It has the makings of being a good city builder sim like the others in the genre, however in it's VERY early access state it's a no from me. Like with most of these city builder sims you get to run your very own village, build up, and survive against hostile threats or the elements whether it be the weather kind or the sickness/virus kind; There is no tutorial level of any kind, only tutorial objectives at the beginning of every 'build' scenario, be very aware the river map (riverside or whatever it's called) is extremely broken or rather poorly implemented, that map forces you to essentially stick to land for most of the build before you even think of building your very cool riverside city. You do get rewards from completing objectives which is nice (kinda of). The biggest turn-off though will be the $30 pricetag for an early access. It's more of a $20 to me or lower, because of how much the game needs work, which btw the developers are listening and responding, etc. Look elsewhere for city builder sims, avoid this one for now until better systems, and better things are add in general.",False,True

"Watched about 5 hours of beginner's guide videos before trying out Story mode in normal difficulty (and even then played the tutorial twice over).  Pretty familiar with the basic concepts, except that after a full day of canvassing the area around a starting village, there wasn't ONE coconut to be found anywhere...  which means zero ability to drink clean water in the game.  Looked on the ground, looked in the palm trees... nada. Been playing other survival games for decades now, and this is the first time a basic need was completely absent from the game.  I finally gave up when my character died from thirst, even when I knew what to look for and what plants to find it near/in.  If I can't gather rainwater, and can't drink coconut juice, and get parasites from every stream nearby which forces me to hunt down the right kind of shrooms..  there's no point in trying to do anything else. Wouldn't recommend the game for that reason alone.  Needs some serious re-thinking for the starting areas of the Story mode map.  Might try again, might not - frustration is not 'fun'.",False,False

"Basically been playing for 2 weeks straight. Every negative comment advising not to play this game is basically on point. Completely newbie unfriendly in both game design and community. Also, apparently, scaling after the tutorial is based upon people who attack enemies in dungeons? But everyone in a group is pulled into combat the moment 1 member enters combat. So how the hell does that bit of developing and coding work? Personally, no one explained anything to me about community unwritten rules of how to do things or why they do things and I get kicked from a Pantheon (guild) because I made mistakes no one ever bothered to explain to newbies not to make.

First of all i want to mention the game is laggy and hasnt been really optimised.. When you drive there are sudenly in some points huge fps drops even tho nothing much is happening around. There is no currency or anything you can buy or story mode so there isnt even motivation to play the game. When you hit a wall the cars is getting destroyed so weirdly and bad. The Looking around is so weird sometimes it even glitches out (almost always) you cant even look around. The main thing i hate about the game its a huge asset flip That everyone can buy and publish it..:  The good thing that i coud actually see taht there were 10  cars that looked insane but compared to their looks they were driving so freaking slow! There were also alot of maps that you coud play on... even tho they were badly made.. - You can customize cars. - Has alot of tracks. - Has Trading Cards. - There are many fps drops - AI isnt very good... saying it nicely.. - Needs way more optimisation - Car damage system Just makes litterally no sense how they break so suddenly it needs way more improvement  - Alot of bugs and glitches but its typical  for Early acces games. - No Steam Achievements. - Its Asset Flip - NO story or anything why woud you want to keep playing - No currency that you coud buy stuff with Rating 3/10 Good thing its still in Early access and there is still hope that it can improve...,False,True

"Yeah, not going to recommend this. Cool idea, implemented poorly.  First the neutral:  Basic Unity assets (which is fine by me, not that much of a graphics snob) and unobtrusive background music (which can be turned off.) Now the Bad:  For a physics game, there's no feeling of weight, friction, momentum, anything really. It feels slippery, like I'm sliding all over the place. Movement is WASD, turning and shooting is with the mouse. There's no sound or anything to alert you where the enemies are, so you must keep a constant AND speedy lookout... however, even with mouse sensitivity up to 150, turning to guard your sides / back was garbage.  After getting hit 4 times, you die.  I am not good at FPS and I KNOW this, but I CAN tell the difference between a good shooter and a crappy one.   Furthermore, just to check myself: I asked a friend (good with FPS games) and my youngest (very good with FPS) to play the game and they both had the same complaint regarding the controls as I did.

"This game was, quite Frankly, a disappointment for me and many others. Having played TNO and TOB I couldn't help but feel I was playing an inferior version of the first game. Personal feelings aside though, here's the review: You play as William J. Blazkowicz (BJ), the protagonist of pretty much every Wolfenstein game. The game starts with BJ waking up from a coma. Nazis are invading Eva's Hammer (Captured by the resistance, now used as HQ). The story of the game is good. Not as good as TNO but still better than TOB.  The first problem appears in the first level of the game: The difficulty. Now, I'm a sucker for hard games, but The New Colossus is just a weird cookie. The game makes you feel like a badass, but try to stand still in a battle for two seconds and you're dead. It's not the type of hard that incentivises you to get better to do better, it's all just based on luck. The action in this game is completely dumbed down because of this. You'll either hide and hope you find a medkit or armor (that will get devoured by bullets in seconds) or restart the level to try a different approach. Here we get to the second giant issue I have with the game. TNO and TOB had two different ways of completing a mission. You could either go doomguy style and kill everything in your way but lose a ton of health or you could go for a silent way by stealth killing enemies without them knowing what hit them thus preserving health and armor for the next level. This diversified style of play brought in so much more replay value to the game. You simply can't do that in Wolfenstein 2. Trying to play stealthily in a level designed for reckless play? Good luck finding a place to hide! Trying to play recklesly in a level designed for stealth? You'll get shot down in seconds! It really eliminates the will to play the game again, knowing that you'll have to play the same way again This leads us to the last problem I have with the game: The level design. It is simply HORRID. There's this part in New Orleans: You are heading down a dim alley. You see two paths: The one to the left is lit up and has enemies coming out of it, while the one to the right is dark and unlit. Which path do you think is the right one? This is not good level design, and it's not the only level. You will lose just so much time wondering where you have to go. Time that could have been spent on killing nazis. As for the weapons, they are ok, not the most interesting but they do reflect the time this game takes place in. Even though some look like they were made in the Age of Steam, while others look really futuristic. The enemies I like. They are varied and interesting, from normal humans all the way to robot dogs breathing fire. Too bad Steam doesn't have a neutral review type. That is what I would give this game. It's not bad per se but compared to the last games, it's definitely inferior. Edit: Minor typos",False,False

"i pre-ordered the game all the way back in 2016, i didnt return it because i was hoping it would get better. Recently my roommates have begun to play it and i decided to reinstall it to try and join in on their fun. But i cant because of a dumb bug where when i try to join them i just get booted back to the main menu, 4 years later and the game is still a buggy mess. I got to play it for like an hour before i tried to join them because i could only start a single player journey, they joined me and it went fine for a bit. They flew away to somewhere else and i tried to then join them since i had just repaired the ship and got to another planet(thinking i had finished the tutorial or something. But now i'm back to the same bug but now i cant even play the game at all. No single player or multiplayer. Here some info on the bug so you can fix your game. I tried to join them and got sent to a white screen, i had the normal cursor you have on the desktop, i couldn't open task manager to force close, and eventually the program just crashed. Freeing me from a pure white screen and this buggy pos game that hasn't been fixed for 4 YEARS. I doubt i can even get a refund now 4 years later but hey keep the money i pre-ordered the game with and please put it toward fixing these bugs. Instead of implementing vr, why not fix the game? I will say though that the hour i got to play was enjoyable, but if i cant play the game whats the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ point?",False,False
Came here to leave a bad review because I do not (and will not) own GTA 5. Take-Two Interactive cannot seem to get it right time and time again. They attack singleplayer modders and use the excuse that people can use tools such as OpenIV to hack online (which doesn't happen). Maybe they should get their asses to work and solve online hacking in code and not in the courtroom. I will never own another Take-Two/Rockstar product ever again.,False,False

Would-be devs should take note. Bugs are expected with Early Access, but having a game that literally does not allow the players to login and play it? That is completely unacceptable, even for Early Access. Do I think this game deserves the reviews it's getting? The actual game... no, probably not. It showed promise and it seemed cool. But nobody can play it. So yes, because the devs did not plan properly and did not prepare better, I do think the poor reviews about server instability are entirely justified. This is the consequence of releasing a game to Early Access in such an unprepared state that the players can not even log in. Give it a week and check back in to see if any of us can even get in.

"I don't usually write reviews unless I see a potential but unfortunately I can't recommend this game at this stage. Game needs a whole a lot of balancing between production and consumption with the environmental events (such as invasions and the winter come). Your production is like never enough for what you consume regularly and you cant research or provide the essentials needs before the winter. About the invasions; it's happening so often you keep losing health and before recovering your folks, some other s...storm popping up. Needs more mechanics like being able to control your population's actions, free roaming -not stationary- security job assignments from the beginning and maybe grouping the security teams with some hotkeys, being able to occupy or deconstruct the existing buildings in the map -cuz hey! why I wanna build a house when there are a lot of em around- Needs a better AI -as many other already mentioned your workers just walking around the danger and waiting to be killed- Bigger maps with extended borders so we can actually pan around and see the inside of the buildings scattered around the edges. And I dont understand why the stability is keep going down all the time even tho when I find a sweet balance for a brief time. This is all I got for now. I'll keep updating my review on this one as it keeps progressing. Don't get me wrong tho. Im not saying this game is just bad. all im saying is, it needs a better polished gameplay to actually have fun and focus on management with the full control of the map and its features.",False,True

"Okay so if you dont want to read the full review here is a sum up: decent but short story. Large area to explore but it feels empty, decent items added but not many of them. Characters are good, well voiced and add to the island/ harbor theme a lot.  : The characters are well voiced and unique compared to the commonwealth NPC's. The rewards in the story are well done and appropriate for the setting and many of the new items are well done aswell, including the uniques legendary weapons and armors you can buy. The island itself is a good atmospheric setting with you having to always worry about rad damage and a fog crawler crawling up on you, the DLC places a lot of emphasis on how dangerous the island is. The children of atom were also well done. : reading what I wrote above you may be wondering why I didnt give a thumb up.............. This is because while all these things are good they are all overshadowed by how empty the world and main quest line feels. The main story line is basically one quest line that gives you the option of which faction to chose at the end regardless of how you have interacted with them( you can do all far harbor mics quests and have done none for the Children of Atom and yet you can side with the children in the end), its as if the choices we make are invalid and the quest is chummed up into one single decision. While the island itself is large and takes some time to explore if you are just walking around it just feels empty with few interesting locations outside the ones used for the main quest. There are five new enemies added of which two are basically from the base game but with new names(trappers=raiders, wolves= rabid/attack dogs), this means that wile there are three new enemies they get boring after 3 or so hours. Its not at all work the price tag( i bought it after look at some screen shots and watching some videos and it looked good), i was extremely disappointed by the sheer lack of content like they sort of slapped it together and added a decent sized price tag. I recommend waiting for a sale or just not buying it. With that money i could have bought two or even three decent games full of content. Really disappointed and underwhelmed by this soulless excuse for a full priced DLC.",False,False

"""Life Is Strange is a five part episodic game that sets out to REVOLUTIONISE STORY BASED CHOICE and CONSEQENCE GAMES.""* If Dontnod meant to show once and for all that Story Based Choices have NO Conseqences in the end, well then they succeeded. The Revolution is called off. I really loved playing the game. Especially the first 2 episodes are brilliant with their melancholy. And the Soundtrack is awesome. But with that advertisment in mind you can only be disappointed with the ending. Your choices are totally unimportant for the outcome. Furthermore the story leaves you with so many questions but doesn't provide any answers. I can understand why games like TWD and LiS can not offer real choices. You have to develop a lot of alternative scenarios that only a certain amount of players will see. It just wouldn't pay off for the devs in the end.

Also the huge selling point of the game, the coop gameplay, is just horrible. It's ridclisouly easy and doesn't require any way of coordination or tactic whatsover. You basically can't fail in this game. It's an interactive movie that plays itself and not a fun coop experience.  I give the game some credits for the first chapter (the only good part in the game) and the overall idea. ""A Way Out"" could have been so much better if they had focused more on the main aspect of the game and made the gameplay more complex and challenging, but they rather decided to put their effort in creating a generic plot to make it more cinematic and appealing to a wider audience.

Although, I cannot possibly say that I'm satisfied with this game - I've played about 50 hours on my PS4 and a few on PC to be able to come to a verdict about this game which is still ... quite confusing and pointless It simply needs tons of improvements, which I think the team will serve, but it's still a long way ahead from what we all desire it to be. I feel so sorry for not being able to give it a ""thumbs up"" after their hard work but it is not nearly enough.

He has been nerfed into the ground based on bad players and one of his perks ""Fired up"" doesn't even work properly and the devs don't seem to care. So you're basically paying for a killer who is almost as bad as Wraith while the survivor and his perks are sub par. The survivor is quentin who is an instantly forgettable character from the 2010 elm street remake.

"Armed with a water-gun inside a dance / stripclub, the goal in Wet Girls is to entirely soak the dancers clothes. Within a given time, without running out of ammunition and successfully evading the security guards. Gameplay and controls are rudimentary, moving around is done by the classic WASD keys. There are the options to pan the camera left or right and to zoom in and out. Some skill and patience are required to move to the exact spots. Squirting is done by mouse look and LMB.  There is the option to rebind keys, through the Input Tab page on the configuration dialogue before the game starts*. Although the Steam store displays the “nudity” & “sexual content” tags for this game, there is little that shows of these when playing. Clothing merely gets a bit of transparent, but that’s about it. Only the free DLC shows sexual content. The dancers move in a very fluent, smooth and natural way, however, an enjoyable feature. Every stage / girl has her own specific dance style and moves, music accordingly. As you progress through the levels, difficulty mildly picks up with each girl. At one point, a security guard is on the lookout and the player has to be careful not to squirt when the guard is paying attention. Simply implemented by adding a timer on top of his head. With another timer to keep in mind, this is a very annoying feature, it slows down gameplay for no obvious reason, simply adding frustration to an already obnoxious game. Somewhat halfway in the game, a freehand mode gets unlocked, would have been nice if there would have been something to freehand… To conclude: during gameplay, I myself never got into a flow or got immersed somehow. It felt a chore to complete the game and unlock its achievements. Developer definitively could / should have done more with this rather unique concept, a shame. Too short, too little gameplay, too little nudity made me recommend against this title. Bought this at a 50% discount to unlock another perfect game through it’s achievements. To find out later, this game is not eligible for a perfect game on someone’s profile. Cheers, SultanK *In my initial review I stated: “No option to rebind keys is available, which is rather uncomfortable for azerty keyboard users.

"I bought this game because I am a fan of Kill la Kill and arc system works, that being said this game had big expectations, but when I played it, it left me with mixed feelings, so let's go over the pros and cons - The game really captured the style of kill la kill, from the anime shading, to the lighting to the exaggerated poses and angles, it really stays true to the original work - This game is really mechanically sound, it is simple enough to play casually, yet has enough depth to fill the needs of any competitive player - the roster is really varied, literally no character uses the same fighting style, even the same characters when changing their weapons fight completely different I haven't played online, but from what I've heard in forums and comments, the net code is pretty good, even playing with players from the other side of the world feels fluid - There are several game crashing bugs, and   of annoying bugs, like the characters shadows messing up and showing as horizontal stripes, the hud being illegible, and the screen going completely black. it seems as if it wasn't optimized for PC at all - There is, for some reason, a prohibition to stream or upload any videos containing story, in-depth analysis, or most game modes apart from versus, I understand why they'd choose to censor the story so that it doesn't get spoiled, but the other two? it's just weird they'd shoot themselves in the foot like that, that is basically how a competitive scene starts to grow - While the roster is varied, every fighter has a gimmick, and they have to stick to that gimmick, which in turn limits play style to that specific fighter. - The stages seem like there was very little effort put into them, they're just...plain - The story mode seems a bit draggy, you get several minutes of exposition dialogue cutscenes, whith a few fights in between. I liked the ending of Ryoko, though. - The other game modes are good, but don't seem very polished, specially the ""covers"" mode, that puts you against a lot of covers enemies, it's basically the equivalent of muliman smash in smash bros., the thing is, you can't lock into a single enemy, and oftyen you'll end up attacking the wrong covers just because it was closer to you - customization is really bad, there is only 3 colors, with one being a black and green mess, though this is something minor. in short, the game has potential, but if they don't fix these issues fast, this game is gonna die faster than you can say SEN I SOSHITSU",False,False

Its a good time passer. Lots of cheating scrubs. I only play when I dont want to play anything else. LOTS of racist A-holes...I would only recommend this game if you can get it for free.,False,False
"Do not buy this game. The population is too small and you cant even find a game. I had this on discord when it launched a year ago when it was 10$ more expensive, it had its issues but there a lot of problems that impacted development and the game died shortly after. It seems like its happening again. This game isnt worth 30AUD. Save your money and move on",False,False
"Can anyone inform me on how to get past the first robots that can harm you in the game cause Im legit stuck on that part! I cant get close to them to sneak around cause they always detect me, I cant throw stuff at them to take them out, throwing stuff at a wall in an attempt to distract them doesn't work, and when I get spotted hiding no matter where I hide, they always somehow manage to find me do they have phycic powers or something? Oh also whenever I respawn the robot that killed me is still looking in my direction (the checkpoint resetting system must be buggy/incomplete) so without any possible chance to react and run away HE SHOOTS ME AGAIN! Call me a noob but I think this game has some pretty poor game design, I have no idea what to do besides get some card that I cant reach and use it on a door to escape but besides that Im not given any indication as to what to do or any in game assistance to help me out when im stuck! Its pretty funny seeing how long I can dodge bullets coming from what appear to be 6 shot revolvers shooting with unlimited ammo. Overall The game seems cool, but Im stuck on the first level!!!",False,False

"It's an interesting game at first, it has good atmosphere and good voice acting. The story has potential in the first hour or two but then it goes completely downhill and by the end I couldn't even care anymore. Some puzzles are annoying as hell, graphics are serviceable at best and ugly at times. I wanted to like it but it's not as smart of an experience as I thought it would be, it's not smart at all actually.  It's too long for its own good and you won't remember it shortly after you finish it. To be fair I bought it for under 1 euro and for that price it delivered enough content but I can't recommend it for anything higher. I will change it into a mixed review if that option ever becomes available but until then I'll have to give it a negative.",False,False

"Unfortunatly, I have to give this game a bad review probably 5.5 / 10 (for now atleast). It is a good game and I love it to death, for 60 dollars though I cant say it was worth the money. It has some pretty big problems that make the game un enjoyable, atleast to me. Remeber to take this as my opinion and nothing else. First I'll start with one of the biggest things like I notice. Lack of customization. From the creators of Planet coaster, I expected more customization in the area of park design. These are a few of the things I've noticed in the customization area.    Number 1. Considering these guys made planet coaster, which has loads of customization, this game is sorely lacking in that area. We only have a basic set of buildings, that, while I do enjoy the look of, are still pretty bland and un-interesting. For someone like me who loves to customize and to make things look pretty... you just cant. Everything is so bland and boring, so much empty space I can use.    Number 2. In number one I just talked about buildings that would go on your mainstreet, Fast Food, Clothes Shop, Arcade, ect. For a game that is centered around building exhibits for your animals to stay in, it has only one attraction (other than the basic 2 viewing platforms) that attraction being the Gyrosphere. I like the way it looks and works however, thats all there is. In the movies  we had a host of different of attractions and unfortunatly we only get one on release of this game. I expect more to be added in the future possibly as DLC or whatever so this isnt to big of an issue.     Number 3. Because we are talking about the parks specificaly, I wish the people were more interesting, not so much as an issue as it is a personal preference, it just seems as though our guests are pretty bland and dont matter very much. I mean if a dino gets out and kills a bunch of people, its not a very big deal. In my experience once you get your park to that size you have so much money it doesnt even matter, you can just pay whatever you need and be done. I feel like one death should mean more than it does, if that makes sence.    So i think that concludes the park side of things, this next bit is more of the animal and AI side of things. See, the game seems to have been rushed. Universal wanted to release the game along side the new movie. Unfortunatly the Frontier team wasnt able to work out all the kinks with the AI and rest of the game in that time.     Number 4. Talking of AI, the dinos for one dont have very many actions. Because you will probably spend so much time watching them, the same basic interactions are really boring. They dont sleep, they dont herd, they dont play, the only things they really do is stand in this odd looking circle and roar at eachother and walk  around... oh, and eat. Thats about all, they do atleast panic and run from you or your other dinos. As far as what they do while just chilling thats about all. And because they don't herd, in larger herbie exhibits, one may run off to the endge of the fence, then procede to get royally pissed off because it doesnt have any friends near it, break out, kill some people, and thats it. But it happens all the time and its super frustrating to see the popup of a broken fence right as you're about to get 5 stars and suddelny drop to 3, plus, you have even more herbies getting out and its just a big fluster cluck. The most obvious fix for this is just have a herd mentality for animals that require a herd to live happily.    The AI does need alot of work. My main problems are that the dino AI is pretty bad as of now, as well as the guest AI running into enclosures :/ and I would like to see more customization for parks. Also, side note, the terrain, teraforming, and placing buildings down is complete crap. Buildings fit where they clearly shouldn't, don't where they should, its just poorly designed.     Again my main points are.  The dino AI needs to be refined a bit better. The dinos need more things to do such as activities.  We need more attractions for our guests to take part in, like the gyrospheres. We also need more cusomization and little things to fill in sapce and add an extra level of authenticity to our parks. Obviously, aquatic and flying animals.  I would also go for some new kind of transport along with the monorail.  All in all I say 5.75/10 This game can be so much more and a worthy successor to JPOG it just needs a little work.",False,False

"Sadly can't recommend. For stealthing solo anyway,   FIXED YAY! , same number of guards on normal as death sentence, guards see you fueling the plane before you leave. these things shouldn't have gotten past QA. unless they fix this its going to be a no from me.",False,False
"Well that was disappointing,Sadly the game itself looked somehow well made from that era however it doesn't mean the story had to suffer or be rather not engaging for I finished the 1st chapter and legit had no reason not feel to keep going on with the game at all,And the pacing of a story is is rather off,as in most horror games from before the 2000's they didn't spawn you in the game and tell you hey you see that tower go there,for all I knew this protagonist had no reason to go there,He just needed to go there,I would been nice if we got to know this protagonist for a bit and live in his shoes for damm 20 min at least and then the horror things happen to him,but it seems he was in the roof for no reason at all as when he sees the monsters for the first time he seems to be unaware of that they exist no to be ready for them at all thus making him be in the roof top as odd as it could be,I legit can not recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the old horror games for this game just look like them but sure as hell played like one but the thing is they tried too hard on making the control feel like old games",False,False

"Early September the server/games are full of hackers... Most maps are fun the gameplay itself (not accounting for other players bad behaviors) are fun... Having flying speedhacker in 6/12 games is not fun. I don't need to win, i don't need to reach the final but seeing people fly around in half of the game (flying because of hacking and not because of physics highjinx) is no fun at all... And i can't even properly report those people at this time... With some more maps and way less hacker i will probably recommend this game, for now... i can't recommend this, not even in sale.",False,False

"EDIT: The game has stopped detecting my steering wheel, no help from codemasters or community manager who assured me they will look into it but never heard from them again. Many people suffer with the same issues but no help from the the developers. Here we go again. Every other game works great with my wheel but this game suddenly stopped to work, doesnt detect my wheel at all. Tried so many fixes but nothing. Well I cant play the game anymore so I wont preorder DIRT 4. Previous review: I really didnt expect this to be such fun. After Dirt 3 they started from scratch and the result is brutal. Great great fun but it slowly takes your soul. Wish they would add even more tracks and even more cars. Play with a wheel pls.",False,False

"I hate to make it a negative vote. I'm not much of a DOOM fan, but I very much enjoyed DOOM 2016. DOOM Eternal feels like a recycle of the previous DOOM. Same strategy of shooting till you run out of ammo, having to rely on a chainsaw to refill your ammunition. Some glory kill animations I noticed were reused from DOOM 2016, which feels kinda lazy on their part. Conclusion, $60 for a single player game doesn't feel too great. I would wait until this game goes on sale.",False,False
